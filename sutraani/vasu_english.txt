    "11001": "This defines the word _vriddhi_. The letters आ, ऐ and औ are _vriddhi_ letters. The _sutra_ consists of three words _vriddhi_, _ât_ and _aich_. आत् means the long आ, the final त् being indicatory only, and is for the sake of the _pratyâhâra_ _aich_, and the _pratyâhâra_ ऐच् means the letters ऐ and औ.\n\nThe indicatory त् in आत् serves the purpose of showing that the very form आ having two _måtrâs_ or prosodial measure, is to be taken. This त् also joins with the succeeding vowels ऐ and औ by the rule of तपर (I.1.70) or that \"which precedes or succeeds त्\" and indicates that these vowels must be taken as having two _mâtrâs_ only, though they may be the result of the combination of vowels whose aggregate _mâtrâs_ may be more than two. A short vowel has one _måtrâ_, a long vowel has two, and a consonant has half a _mátrâ_. Thus by a rule of arm or euphonic conjunction of letters आ+आ=आ, as महा + आशयः = महाशयः. Here हा has two _mâtrâs_ and not four. So also खट्वैडकः the vowel ऐ the resultant of आ+ऐ has only two, not four, _mâtrâs_.\n\nThus the initial vowels in the following secondary derivative nouns are _vriddhi_ forms of their primitive vowels. आङ्गः \"bodily\", from अङ्गः; 'body' ऐच्छिकः \"optional\", from इच्छा \"option\"; औपगवः \"the son of _Upagu_\", from the word उपगुः meaning \"a sage called _Upagu_\". Similarly in शालीयः \"belonging to the house\" the आ is radical, and is also called _vriddhi_. The word _vriddhi_ occurs in _sûtras_ like सिचिवृद्धिपरस्मैपदेषु (VII.2.1) \"Let the final इक् of the base get _vriddhi_ substitute before the affix सिच् of the _Parasmaipada_\".",
    "11002": "Each one of the letters अ, ए and ओ whether radical or secondary is called a _guna_ letter; as the initial vowels in the following:- अर्त्ति,\"he moves\"; एति \"he comes\", ओखति \"he goes.\" Here the initial vowels of the roots ऋ, इ, and उख् have been respectively _gunated_ into अर्, ए, and ओ before the third person singular termination ति.\n\nThe term _Guna_ occurs in _sutras_ like मिदेर्गुणः (VII.3.82). \"Let there be _guna_ substitute for the _ik_ of the root मिद् \"to melt.\"",
    "11003": "This is a _paribhasha_ _sutra_, and is useful in determining the original letters, in the place of which the substitute _guna_ and _vriddhi_ letters will come. The present rule will apply where there is the specification of no other particular rule.\n\nThus _sutra_ (VII.3.84) declares:- \"when a _sarvadhatuka_ or an _ardhadhatuka_ affix follows there is _guna_ of the base.\" Here the _sthani_ or the original expression which is to be _gunated_, is not specified, and to complete the sense, the word \"_ikah_\" must be read into the _sutra_. The rule then being, \"when a S. or an A. affix follows there is _guna_ of the _ik_ vowels of the base.\" The _guna_ of इ or ई is ए; of उ or ऊ, is ओ, of ऋ or ॠ is अर्, of ऌ is अल्; and their _Vrddhi_ is ऐ, औ, आर् and आल् respectively. Thus नी + अति = ने + अति = नयति \"he leads.\"\n\nTherefore, wherever in any rule in this Grammar, _guna_ or _vriddhi_ is ordained by employing the terms _guņa_ or _vriddhi_, there the word \"_ikah_\" in the genitive case, meaning \"in the place of _ik_\", is to be supplied to complete the sense.\n\nThe word '_ik_' is thus understood in the following rules, and is there qualified by the term अङ्ग or 'base':- मिदेर्गुणः (VII.3.82) मृजेर्वृद्धिः (VII.2.114) पुगन्तलघूपध &c., (VII.3.86); ऋच्छत्यॄताम् (VII.4.11) ऋदृशोऽङि गुणः (VII.4.16) स्थूलदूरयुव &c., (VI.4.156).\n\nIn the following _sutras_, the term '_ik_' is understood and qualifies the word _ånga_ or base, जुसि च (VII. 3. 83), सार्वधातुकार्धधातुकयोः (VII.3.84).\n\nThese _sutras_ will be explained in their proper places.\n\nThe word '_ik_' has been used in the _sutra_ to show that the long आ, एच् or the diphthongs and हल् or the consonants, are not to take _guna_ or _vriddhi_ by this rule, as in the following examples यानम् \"a carriage\", ग्लायति \"he feels aversion\", उम्भिता \"confined\".\n\nHere ग्लायति is formed by adding the affix तिप्, third person singular termination, with the class a affix शप्, to the root ग्लै; as ग्लै+शप्+तिप्=ग्लै+अ+ति. At this stage, rule (VII.3.84), would require the _guna_ substitution of the vowel of the base before the _sarvadhatuka_ termination अ; the _guna_ substitute of ऐ being ए, there would be ग्ले+अति=ग्लयति. But this is wrong, the letter ऐ, being not included in the _pratyâhåra_ _ik_, is not affected by rule (VII.3.84), and there is no _guna_ substitution in this case. Similarly there is no change in the long आ of यानम्. Thus या+ल्युट् (III.3.115) = यानम् (VII.1.1). Here had there been _guņa_ by Rule (VII.3.84), the आ of या, would have been changed into अ, and the form would have been यनम् which is wrong. But it is not so, as आ is not an इक् vowel. So also उम्भ्+इता = उम्भिता. Here, there is no _guna_ substitution in the place of the consonant भ्.\n\nThe repetition of the words _guna_ and _vriddhi_ in this _sútra_, (though by अनुवृत्ति or the supplying of a word from the previous _sūtra_, these words followed from the two preceding _sutras_) is for the purpose of indicating that, this is a restrictive rule applicable only there, where _guņa_ or _vriddhi_ has been ordained by the employment of the words _guna_ or _vriddhi_. Therefore, it is not so in the following cases :- द्यौः \"sky\", पन्थाः \"way\" सः \"he,\" इमम् \"this\". द्यौः is the nominative singular of the base दिव्. It is formed by rule (VII.1.84), which declares that \"in the nominative singular the letter औ takes the place of दिव्\". Here the letter औ is no doubt a _vriddhi_ letter, but as this substitution is not enjoined by the enunciation of the term _vriddhi_, औ does not take the place of the vowel इ of दिव्, but it replaces the final व्. Thus दि+औ+स्=द्यौः.\n\nSimilarly rule (VII.1.85), declares that of the word पथिन्, आ is the substitute. The आ is a _vriddhi_ letter no doubt, but not being enunciated by the term _vriddhi_, it takes the place of न् of पथिन् and not of इ. Thus we have पन्थाः, the न being added by (VII.1.87).\n\nSimilarly सः from तद्, which is formed by (VII.2.102) \"short अ is the substitute of _tyad_, &c.,\" Here अ takes the place of द्. Thus we have त, which is changed again into स by (VII.2.106).",
    "11004": "This is an exception to _sūtra_ 3. By that _sūtra_ _iks_ were to be _gunated_ or _vriddhied_ and by _sūtra_ (VII.3.84), the root is to be _gunated_ before all _ardhadhatuka_ terminations. All primary affixes, that are applied directly to roots in Sanskrit, are divided into two broad classes, called _sårvadhâtuka_ and _årdhadhâtuka_. The affixes marked with an indicatory श (called शित्), and the conjugational affixes, such as तिप्, तः &c., (called तिङ्) are _sårvadhatuka_; all other affixes are called _årdhadhâtuka_.\n\nThough by the general rule, (VII.3.84), the root is to be _gunated_ before _årdhadhâtuka_ terminations, yet it is not to be so, before those affixes which cause the लोप 'lopping off or ellipses' of a portion or a member of the original _dhấtu_. Thus the termination स्यामि is a first person singular termination of the future tense ( लृट् ) and is an _ardhadhâtuka_ termination; when this is added to root जि 'to excel' the इ of जि becomes _gunated_ and we have जेष्यामि \"I shall or will excel.\" But in those cases where there is a _lopa_ of the member of a root form, caused by an affix, there is no _guṇation_. Thus in लोलुवः \"a great cutter\", the original root is लू \"to cut\" which forms the Intensive verb लोलूय. In forming the noun of agency from the verb लोलूय, an _ardhadhatuka_ suffix अच् (III.1.134), is added. Thus लोलूय+अच्. At this stage, by force of _sūtra_ (II.4.74) which declares that \"before the affix अच् (III.1.134) the य of the Intensive verb must be suppressed,\" the _ya_ is dropped and we have लोलू+अ. Here by the general rule (VII.3.84), the final ऊ would have been _gunated_. But by virtue of the present _sūtra_, no _guna_ takes place, because here on account of the _ardhadhâtuka_ affix अच्, a portion of the root, namely, य, has been elided; therefore no _guņa_ takes place. Thus we have लोलुवः \"a great cutter.\"\n\nThe word धातु \"root\" has been used in the _sûtra_, in order to indicate that the exception does not apply where there is an elision of an _anubandha_ or of an affix. As in लूञ्+इता = लो+इता = लविता. Here the indicatory letter ञ् has been elided, but that does not prevent _gunation_. Similarly in रेड् the affix विच् is added to the root रिष् \"to injure.\" Thus रिष्+विच् (III.2.75) = रिष्+व् (I.3.2) and (I.3.3) = रिष्+० (VI.1.67). Here the affix व् is elided, but nevertheless, the _guṇa_ substitute must take place in रिष्. Thus we have रिष्+० = रेष् (VII.3.86) and (I.1.62) = रेड् (VIII.2.39).\n\nThe word _ardhadhâtuka_ has been used to indicate that a _sarvadhatuka_ affix which causes the elision of a portion of a root, does not prevent _guna_ or _vriddhi_ as in रोरवीति, (_Rig Veda_ IV.58.3) \"he roars much\". रू+यङ् = रोरुव (III.1.22). रोरुय+तिप् = रोरु+ति (II.4.74). Here the _sarvadhatuka_ affix तिप् causes the elision of य, a portion of the root. The _guna_ substitution however takes place, and we have रोरो+ई+ति (VII.3.94) = रोरवीति, the augment ईट् being added by _sūtra_ (VII.3.94).\n\nThe word \"_ikah_\" of the previous _sūtra_ is understood in this _sūtra_ also. The _ik_ letters only are not _gunated_ or _vriddhied_ before such _ardhadbatuka_ affixes; the other vowels may do so. Thus in अभाजि the equation is as follows:- अ+भञ्ज्+चिण् = अ+भज्+इ (VI.4.33). Here the _ardhadhátuka_ affix चिण् has caused a portion of the root भञ्ज्, to be suppressed, vis., the letter ञ् has been elided. But nevertheless the अ of भज् is _vriddhied_ before चिण् because अ is not included in the _pratyahara_ _ik_ ; and the exception contained in the present _sutra_ only applies to the _ik_ letters. So also रञ्ज्+घञ् (III.3.18) = रज्+अ (VI.4.27) = रागः (VII.2.116) and (VII.3.52).",
    "11005": "Thus the past participle terminations क्त and क्तवतु are _ardhadhatuka_ affixes, which would, by the general rule (VII.3.84), have caused _guna_, but as their indicatory letter क is इत्, the real terminations being, त and तवत्, they do not cause _guna_. Therefore, when these terminations are added to a root, the _ik_ of the root is not _gunated_. Thus with the root चि \"to collect\" we have चितः or चितवान्, श्रू, \"to hear\", श्रुतः, श्रुतवान्; भी; \"to fear\" भीतः, भीतवान्.\n\nSimilarly the terminations क्यप् केलिम, क्वसु कानच्, क्त्वा, क्तिन्, &c., are all कित् terminations 'the indicatory letters of all being क्,' the real affixes being य, एलिम्, वस् &c. &c. &c. Before these, the root is not _gunated_. Thus we have from भृ \"to bear\" भृत्व, from भिद् \"to pierce\" भिदेलिम.\n\nThe terms कित् &c., of this _sûtra_ are in the locative or seventh case. The force of this case termination here is that of निमित or cause, that is the _guna_ or _vriddhi_ which would otherwise have been caused, does not take place, if an affix is कित्, गित्, ङित्. Thus all _ardhadhâtuka_ and _sårvadhatuka_ affixes cause _gunation_ of the final _ik_ of the inflective base (VII.3.84.) Thus the _Sårvadhâtuka_ affix शप्(अ) in the following:-\n\nभू+शप्+तिप् = भो+अ+ति = भवति \"he is.\" Similarly _sårvadhatuka_ and _ardbadhâtuka_ affixes cause the _guna_ substitution of the short penultimate _ik_ of the inflective base (VII.3.85). Thus बुध्+शप्+तिप् = बोधति.\n\nThe general force of the locative case in an aphorism is to cause the operation directed, on the expression immediately preceding it (I.1.66). If the force of the locative case in the present _sūtra_ were also that as explained in (I.1.66), then the interpretation would be this:- An affix having an indicatory _k_, _g_ or _ṅ_, would not cause the _guna_ substitution of the vowel _ik_, immediately preceding it. The case of the penultimate short _ik_ will not be covered by it. Then though the rule may apply to चि+क्त=चितः \"collected\" it would not apply to भिद्+क्त; there would be nothing to bar the _guna_ substitution of the penultimate इ of भिद्. This however is prevented by explaining the locative as one of \"occasion\" and thus भिद्+क्त = भिन्नः \"broken.\"\n\nSimilarly from the root जि we have a word जिष्णुः 'victorious', in which the affix ग्स्नु has an indicatory ग्. Thus जि+ग्स्नु = जिष्णुः \"victorious\" (III.2.139), so also स्थास्नुः \"durable,\"\n\nSimilarly the affix, अङ् is a ङित् affix, the real suffix being अ, the ङ् being merely indicatory. Therefore when अङ् is added to a root, there is no _gunation_ or _vriddhing_. Thus we have from विद् \"to know\" विदः.\n\nSimilarly by (I.2.4), all _sårvadhâtuka_ affixes that are not marked by an indicatory प्, are treated as ङित्. Thus the second person singular termination तस् is ङित्, and we have चिनुतः \"they two collect,\" similarly चिन्वन्ति, \"they collect\", मृज्+क्त = मृष्टः \"cleansed,\" मृजन्ति \"they cleanse.\"\n\nThe phrase \"when indicated by the term _ik_\" is understood in this _sutra_. The prohibition, therefore, applies to _ik_ vowels only, and not to all vowels in general. Thus by (III.1.30), the root कम् \"to desire\" takes the affix णिङ्; of this affix the letters ण् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is इ. The force of ण् is to cause _vriddhi_ (VII.2.116). The indicatory ङ् does not prevent such _vriddhi_, as the letter अ of कम् is not included in _ik_. Thus we have कामि+अते = कामे+अते = कामयते \"he desires\".\n\nAccording to the wish of the author of the _Mahabhashya_, the verb मृज् optionally takes _vriddhi_, before _kit_ or _ṅit_ affixes beginning with a vowel. As परिमृजन्ति or परिमार्जन्ति \"they rub.\" Here in this _sūtra_ there is prohibition of the _guna_ of the short penultimate _ik_ also.\n\nThe indicatory ङ् of the verbal tense affixes i.e., लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ्, लृङ् is an exception to this rule of ङित्. This is an inference deduced from (III.4.104) which declares \"when the sense is that of benediction, then the augment यासुट् of लिङ् is as if it were distinguished by an indicatory क.\" There would have been no necessity of making यासुट् a कित्, if लिङ् were a ङित्, but the very fact of making यासुट् a कित् indicates by implication or is ज्ञापक that the final ङ of लिङ्, लङ् &c. does not make these tense affixes ङित्. Thus in लङ् or Imperfect tense we have अचिनवम् \"he collected\" (अचिनू+लङ् = अचिनु+अम् = अचिनो+अम् = अचिनवम्.)",
    "11006": "The roots दीधी and वेवी never take the _guna_ or _vriddhi_ substitutions under ordinary circumstances. Thus the affix ण्वुल् generally causes _vriddhi_ substitution when added to any root; and so the affix ल्युट् causes _guņa_. But these affixes when applied to the verbs _didhi_ and _vevi_, never cause _vřiddhi_ or _guna_ substitution. As आदीधी+ण्वुल् = आदीधी+अक (VII.1.1) = आदीध्वकः (VI.1.77). So also आदीधी+ल्युट् = आदीधी+अन (VII.1.1) = आदीध्वनम्. Similarly from वेवी we have आवेव्यनम् and आवेव्यकः. In the Vedas, however, these verbs take _guna_. Thus अदीधेत् (_Rig_ _Ved_. X.98.7), and अदीधयुः (_Rig_ _Ved_. V.40.5). These two verbs are confined generally to the Vedic literature, and the present rule therefore, seems to be an unnecessary prohibition; as they take _guna_ in spite of such prohibition.\n\nOf the augment इट् the real affix is इ. In the general tenses, it is added to certain terminations beginning with consonants of the वल् class, i.e., all consonants except य (VII.2.35). Thus the future termination, first person, singular is स्यामि; this when added to the root चर् \"to move\" requires an intermediate इ, and thus we have the form चरिष्यामि, 'I shall walk.' This इ is never _gunated_ or _vriddhied_, though according to the general rule, coming before an _ardhadhâtuka_ termination, it ought to have been _gunated_.\n\nThe augment इट्, could under no circumstances have taken _vriddhi_, the prohibition therefore, is in the case of the _guna_ substitute of इट्.",
    "11007": "This defines the word _sanyoga_. The _sûtra_ consists of three words, हलः, the plural of the _pratyåhåra_ हल्, denoting all the consonants, अनन्तरः means \"without any separation or space\" and संयोगः which is the word defined, and means \"conjunct consonants.\" So that the _sūtra_ means, conjunct consonants are those consonants between which there is no heterogeneous separating vowel and which are pronounced jointly, such as क्क in the word कुक्कुटः, \"cock.\" The word \"_sanyoga_\" applies to the whole of the conjunct consonants jointly and not to them separately. The plural number shows that the conjunction may be of two or more consonants.\n\nWhy do we say \"consonant\"? If two vowels come together they will not be called \"sanyoga\". Thus तितउच्छत्रं \"a sieve umbrella\", the two vowels अ and उ have come together unseparated by any consonant; yet they are not called _sanyoga_, otherwise the final उ would have been rejected by (VIII.2.23) \"there is elision of the final of that _pada_ which ends in a _sanyoga_ letter.\" Why do we say \"unseparated by a vowel\"? If consonants separated by a vowel were also called _sanyoga_, then in the sentence पचति पनसम्, the syllable सम् would be called _sanyoga_, and by (VIII.2.29), the initial स would be elided.",
    "11008": "This defines the word _anunåsika_. The _sûtra_ consists of four words मुख \"mouth\" नासिका \"nose\" वचनः \"utterance or pronunciation\" and अनुनासिकः \"nasals.\" Though the words मुख + नासिका (II.4.2) will by the rule of composition form मुखनासिकं and not मुखनासिका, yet the latter form might be held to be an irregularity; or the phrase मुखनासिकावचनं may be regarded as a compound of मुखनासिक+आवचनं, the word _avachana_ meaning \"partial utterance.\" That is a letter partially uttered by the nose and partially by the mouth would be called _anunåsika_. Therefore the nasals are those letters which are pronounced from two organs or places, i.e., the mouth and the nose. The pure nasal is _anusvåra_, while _anunasikas_ are different from this, in as much as, that in pronouncing these, the breath passes through the nose and the mouth.\n\nThe vowels are generally so nasalised. 'If, instead of emitting the vowel sound freely through the mouth, we allow the velum pendulum to drop and the air to vibrate through the cavities which connect the nose with the pharynx, we hear the nasal vowels (_anunåsika_).' Thus अँ, आँ. In the Vedas, the particle आङ् is _anunåsika_. As अभ्र आँ अपः (_Rig_ _Veda_. V.48.1), so also पर्षि॑ दी॒ने ग॑भी॒र आँ उग्र॑पुत्रे॒ (_Rig_ _Ved_. VIII. 67. 11).\n\nThe consonants ङ, ञ, ण, न and म are also _anunåsika_. Thus ङ is pronounced by the throat along with the nose, ञ by the palate and nose, ण by the upper palate and nose; न by the teeth and nose, and म by the lip and nose.\n\nThe semi-vowels य, न and ल are also nasalised and are then called _anunåsika_. The term _anunåsika_ is used in _sūtra_ (V.1.126) &c.\n\nWhy have we used the word \"by the mouth\"? This definition will not include _anusvåra_ or the pure nasal, which is pronounced wholly through the nose. Why have we used the word \"by the nose\"? In order to exclude the consonants क, च, ट, त, प &c. &c., which are pronounced wholly and solely through the mouth.",
    "11009": "This defines the word _savarna_ or a homogeneous letter. The _sūtra_ consists of four words :- तुल्य \"equal or similar,\" आस्य \"mouth or place of pronunciation,\" प्रयत्न \"effort\" and सवर्णम् \"words of the same class.\"\n\nThe आस्य or places or portions of the mouth by contact with which various sounds are formed are chiefly the following :- 1. कण्ठ \"throat\" 2. तालु 'palate,' 3. मूर्द्धा, 'head,' 4. दन्ताः 'teeth,' 5. ओष्ठौ 'lips,' 6. नासिका 'nose.'\n\nThe प्रयत्नम् or quality or effort is of two sorts primarily, आभ्यन्तरः \"internal\" and बाह्यः \"external.\" The first is again sub-divided into five parts:-\n\n1. स्पृष्टम् or complete contact of the organs. The twenty-five letters from क to म belong to this class. In pronouncing these there is a complete contact of the root of the tongue with the various places, such as throat, palate, dome of the palate, teeth and lip.\n\n2. ईषत्स्पृष्टम् or slight contact. The letters य, र, ल, व belong to this class of contacts. \"In pronouncing these semi-vowels the two organs, the active and passive, which are necessary for the production of all consonantal noises, are not allowed to touch each other, but only to approach.\"\n\n3. विवृतम् or complete opening. The vowels belong to this class.\n\n4. ईषद् विवृतम् or slight opening. The letters श, ष, स, ह belong to this class. Some however place the vowels and श &c., into one group and call them all _vivrita_.\n\n5. संवृतम् or contracted. In actual use, the organ in the enunciation of the short अ is contracted but it is considered to be open only, as in the case of the other vowels, when the vowel अ is in the state of taking part in some operation of grammar.\n\nThe _abhyantara_ _prayatna_ is the mode of articulation preparatory to the utterance of the sound, the _båhya_-_prayatna_ is the mode of articulation at the close of the utterance of the sound.\n\nThe division of letters according to _abhyantra_ _prayatna_ has been already given. By that we get, 1. the _sparsa_ or mute letters, 2. the _antastha_ or intermediate between _sparsas_ and _ushmans_, or semi-vowel or liquid letters, 3. the _svaras_ or vowels or _vivrita_ letters, 4. the _ushmans_ or sibilants or flatus letters.\n\nThe division of letters according to _båhya_ _prayatna_ gives us first surds or _aghosha_ letters, 2. sonants or _ghosha_ letters. The _aghosha_ are also called _svasa_ letters, the _ghoshas_ are called _nåda_ letters.\n\nThe second division of letters according to _båhya_ _prayatna_ is into;\n\n1. Aspirated (_mahåprana_). 2. Unaspirated (_alpaprana_).\n\nThe vowel अ has eighteen forms. The acute अ (_udatta_), grave अ (_anudatta_) and circumflexed अ ( _svarita_). Each one of these three may be nasalised (_anunasika_), or not (_niranunasika_).\n\nThen lastly everyone of these six may be short, long, or prolated. Thus:- अ, अ॒, अ॑, अँ, अँ॒, अँ॑, आ, आ॒, आ॑, आँ, आँ॒, आँ॑, अ३, अ॒३, अ॑३, अँ३, अँ॒३, अँ॑३.\n\nSimilarly the letters इ, उ and ऋ have also eighteen forms. The letter ऌ has no long form; it has therefore 12 modifications. The diphthongs have no short forms, they have therefore, only 12 forms. The _antastha_ or semi-vowels with the exception of र have two forms each vis., nasalised and un-nasalised. The semi-vowels have no homogeneous letters corresponding to them. All letters of a _varga_ or 'class' are homogeneous to each other.\n\nThus then the homogeneous or _savarna_ letters must satisfy two conditions before they could be called _savarna_. First, their place of pronunciation or आस्य must be the same. Secondly their प्रयत्न or quality must be equal. If one condition be present and the other be absent, there can be no _savarna_-hood. Thus च and श are both palatals, their आस्य or place of pronunciation being तालु 'palate', but still they are not _savarna_, because their प्रयत्न is different, the प्रयत्न of च being _sprishta_ and that of श being _vivrita_.\n\nSimilarly क and च though their प्रयत्न is the same i.e., _sprishta_, yet their आस्य being different, one being guttural and the other palatal, are not _savarna_.\n\nThere is exception to this rule in the case of ऋ and ऌ, which though having different आस्य are still called _savarna_ by virtue of the _varttika_ of _Katyayana_; \"the homogeneousness of ऋ and ऌ , one with another, should be stated.\" Thus होतृ+ऌकारः = होतॄकारः ; here ऋ and ऌ have coalesced into long ॠ by rules of _sandhi_, on the assumption that they are _savarna_ letters.\n\nThe word _savarna_ occurs in _sůtras_ like अकः सवर्णे दीर्घः (VI.1.101).\n\nWhy do we say \"the place of pronunciation\"? So that there may not be homogeneous relationship between कचटत and प whose _prayatna_ is the same but whose _åsya_ is different. What is the harm if we make them _savarna_? Then in words like तर्प्ता and तर्प्तुम्, the प would be elided, if it be held homogeneous with त, by (VIII.4.65), \"there is optional elision of झर्, preceded by a consonant, when a homogeneous झर् follows.\"\n\nWhy do we say \"effort\"? That there may be no homogeneity between इ and the palatals, and य and श, whose organ of pronunciation is the same, but whose _prayatna_ is different. What harm if it be so ? Then in अरुश्च्योतति, the श would be elided before च by the rule already referred to, (VIII.4.65).",
    "11010": "This _sutra_ lays down an exception to the former _sutra_. There can be no homogeneity or _savarna_ relationship between vowels and consonants, though their आस्य and प्रयत्न may be the same. Thus इ and श have the same आस्य namely तालु 'palate,' and the same प्रयत्नः namely _vivrita_, but still they are not to be called _savarna_. Thus in दण्डहस्त, दधिशीतलं &c., the letters अ and ह in the first example, and इ and श in the second not being homogeneous letters; there is no combination or _sandhi_, which would otherwise have taken place.\n\nSimilarly if श and इ be held homogeneous, then विपाश+अण् (IV.3.53) = विपाश्+अण् (VI.4.148); here श would be elided by (VI.4.148), but it is not so and we have वैपाशः \"belonging to _vipåså_ or born therein.\" So also in आनडुहं \"ox-skin,\" the ह would have been omitted, if held homogeneous with अ.",
    "11011": "As a general rule, Sanskrit allows of no hiatus in a sentence. If a word ends in a vowel, and the next word begins with a vowel, the two vowels coalesce, according to certain rules. This is called _sandhi_. But _pragrihyas_ are exceptions to this _sandhi_, \"they are certain terminations, the final vowels of which are not liable to any _sandhi_ rules.\" (VI.1.125). This _sutra_ gives three of these terminations, viz., the duals of nouns or verbs ending in ई (ईत्), ऊ (ऊत्), ए (एत्). Thus:- कवी इमौ \"these two poets,\" so also वायू इति \"two winds;\" माले इति \"these two garlands.\" पचेते इति \"they two cook\" पचेथे इति \"you two cook.\" Here according to the general rule of _sandhi_, the final इ of कवी and the initial इ of इमौ ought to have coalesced into an ई, but it is not so, because कवी is the nominative dual of कवि.\n\nWhy do we say ending in _ī_, _ū_ and _e_? Because when the dual ends in any other vowel this rule will not apply. As वृक्षौ+अत्र = वृक्षावत्र, \"these two trees\" (VI.1.78). Of course it follows from the definition, that ई, ऊ, or ए of the dual number only are _pragrihya_; if these vowels terminate any other number they will not be _pragřihya_ but will follow the general rule of _sandhi_, as कुमारी (I.S.) + अत्र = कुमार्य्यत्र, \"the girl is here\" (VI.1.77).\n\n_Vart_: The prohibition of मनीव &c., should be stated in treating of the _pragrihya_ nature of ई, ऊ &c. Thus मनी (two gems) + इव = मनीव \"like two gems\". So also दम्पतीव \"like a couple,\" जम्पतीव \"like man and wife,\" रोदसीव \"like heaven and earth.\" Some say that this _vårtika_ is unneccessary. Because the final member of the above words is not इव, but the particle व only; which has the same meaning as _iva_.",
    "11012": "In the pronoun अदस्, the dual termination in ई, ऊ or ए will be _pragrihya_ by force of the last _sūtra_, but the present _sûtra_ makes this addition, that in the case of अदस्, all terminations ending in ई, ऊ or ए and preceded by म, of whatever number they may be, will be _pragrihya_. As a matter of fact, there are only two such terminations satisfying the above conditions namely अमी and अमू. The rule may therefore be put in the following words of Dr. Max Muller:- \"The terminations of अमी and अमू nom. plur. masc. and nom. dual of the pronoun अदस् are _pragrihya_.\" As अमी अश्वाः \"Those horses\", and अमू आसते. There is no example of the word _adas_ ending in ए.\n\nWhy do we say \"of the word _adas_\"? The letters ई, ऊ, ए following after the म् of any other word will not be _pragrihya_. As शमी+अत्र = शम्यत्र \"this _sami_ tree.\"\n\nWhy do we say \"after the letter म्\"? Because in the example अमुके+अत्र = अमुकेऽत्र, \"those here,\" the ए, preceded not by म् but by the क of अकच् (V.3.71) is not _pragrihya_, which it would have been by the influence of _sūtra_ II, which includes ए as well as ई and ऊ, and from which the word dual is not supplied here, else this rule would be useless.",
    "11013": "In the Vedic Sanskrit, the declension of nouns sometimes differs somewhat from the ordinary Sanskrit. One of the peculiar Vedic terminations, which replace the ordinary declensional terminations is called शे (VII.1.39). Thus अस्मेइन्द्राबृहस्पती.\n\nOf this substitute शे, the initial श is indicatory, the real suffix being ए. This final ए is a _pragrihya_.\n\nIn the sacred literature there is only one example of this _pragrihya_, as given above; while in imitation of this, we have in secular writing phrases as, त्वेइति, युष्मे इति, मे इति &c.",
    "11014": "This _sūtra_ consists of three words: निपातः \"particle\", एकाच् \"consisting of one vowel,\" अनाङ् \"with the exception of आङ्.\"\n\nAll such particles technically called _nipäta_ (I.4.56) which consist of a simple vowel without any consonant, are _pragřihya_ and therefore are not liable to the rules of _sandhi_. As इ इन्द्र \"Oh, _Indra_\" उ उत्तिष्ठ \"O arise.\"\n\nIt follows from the above definition that those _nipätas_ which consist of two or more letters, vowel and consonant, are not _pragrihya_, e. g. प्र in प्राग्नये वाचमीरय.\n\nआङ् which is not a _pragrihya_, has four significations:- As a diminutive particle when joined to adjectives and nouns, as आ+उष्णम् = ओष्णम् \"little hot, tepid\" (2) as a prefix to verbs, it expresses the senses of \"near\" \"nearto,\" and with verbs of \"motion,\" \"taking\" &c., it shows the reverse of the action, as गम् 'to go', आगम 'to come;' आ+इहि = एहि, (3) as showing the limit inceptive (अभिविधि) \"from,\" \"ever since,\" as आजन्मनः \"ever since his birth,\" (4) as showing the limit exclusive (मर्यादा), \"till\" \"until\" as आ+अध्ययनात् = आध्ययनात्, \"until the reading begins.\" When the particle आ has not any one of the above four senses and is used in expressing regret &c., it is a _pragrihya_, as आ एवं किलासीत् \"Ah! such there once was\", आ एवं मन्यसे \"Oh! do you think so.\"\n\nThe word एकाच् in this aphorism has a peculiar meaning. It means \"consisting of one vowel and nothing else.\" In other words, the vowels themselves when used as निपात, e. g. आ, उ, इ &c. But the term एकाच् has a wider signification than that given to it in this _sūtra_. It means \"a word or a portion of a word consisting of one vowel which can be pronounced at once\"- in other words एकाच् means a \"syllable\". In that sense the words प्र, नि, वि &c., will also be एकाच्, but not so here. Therefore the rule of _sandhi_ will apply to them, thus प्राग्नये वाचमीरय. See _sūtra_ (VI.1.1) where the word एकाच् means a monosyllable.\n\nWhy do we say \"a _nipata_?\" Because if the single vowel is not a particle, but something else, an affix &c., then it will not be a _pragrihya_, as the final अ in चकार \"he did\", is the affix of third person perfect tense, and is liable to _sandhi_; as चकारात्र.",
    "11015": "This _sútra_ consists of one word ओत् the final त् is a surplusage. The words \"_pragrihya_\" and \"_nipåta_\" are to be supplied from the preceding _sutras_ to complete the sense. The meaning is that those particles which end in ओ though consisting of several letters, are _pragrihya_. As अहो अपेहि \"Halloo, go away.\"",
    "11016": "This _sūtra_ gives the opinion of the _Rishi_ _Sakalya_, so that it is an optional rule. Thus both forms वायविति (formed according to the general rule of _sandhi_) and वायो इति (where ओ is _pragrihya_) are correct.\n\nIn _ârsha_ literature the _sandhi_ is imperative, not optional, as एता गा ब्रह्मबन्धवित्यब्रवीत्.\n\nThe mention of the name of any sage, such as that of _Sakalya_ in this _sūtra_, serves generally one of the two purposes :- (1) either it makes the rule an optional one, _vibhåshartham_, or (2) the mention is merely for the sake of showing respect to the particular sage, the rule would have stood as well without such mention; _pujártham_, as the word _Kåsyapa_ in _sutra_ (I.2.15).",
    "11017": "This _sūtra_ consists of the single word उञ् meaning उ. According to the same _Rishi_ _Sakalya_, उञ् is a _pragrihya_, before इति, in modern Sanskrit. This is also an optional rule. Thus उ इति or विति.",
    "11018": "Before the word इति the word ऊञ् is replaced sometimes by ऊँ the long nasal _ū_. Thus ऊँ+इति = ऊँ इति or विति.\n\nIn some authorities the _sûtras_ (I.1.17) and (I.1.18) form but one _sūtra_, and then it is divided by the method of _yoga_-_vibhága_, the division of a single _sūtra_ into two separate _sûtras_ having two distinct rules.",
    "11019": "This _sūtra_ finds its scope in the Vedic literature generally. There is a _sūtra_ (VII.1.39) which declares that \"in the Vedic Sanskrit, the case-affixes _sup_ are often replaced either by सु (I.S.), or are altogether elided, or they are changed into a letter homogeneous with the prior letter, or आ, or आत्, or शे, or या, or डा, or ड्या, or याच्, or आल् takes their place.\" Let us take the example where a case-affix is changed into a letter homogeneous with the prior. Thus the case-affix of the seventh case is ङि (इ). In forming the 7.S. of तनू \"body,\" we have तनू+इ. The इ will be changed into a homogeneous letter with ऊ and we have तनू+ऊ=तनू \"in the body,\" as, अध्यस्यां मामकीतनू (for मामक्यां तन्वाम्). This is the Vedic form, the secular form being तन्वाम्. Similarly गौरी+इ = गौरी \"on the _Gauri_,\" as सोमो गौरी अधिश्रितः (_Rig_ _Veda_ IX.12.3). It is in such cases, therefore, that the long _ī_ and _ū_ are used in the sense of locative, and are _pragrihya_.\n\nIt is only long _ī_ and _ū_ which are _pragrihya_, and not any other vowel, though used in the sense of locative. Thus by the same aphorism (VII.I.39) _ḍå_ (_â_) may be employed to denote the seventh case-affix. Thus अग्नि+ङि = अग्नि+डा = अग्ना \"in the fire,\" as, प्रियः सूर्ये प्रियो अग्ना भवाति य इन्द्राय सुतसोमो ददाशत् (_Rig_ _Veda_ V.37.5). Here अग्ना though in the locative case, its final is not _pragrihya_. Therefore अग्ना+इति = अग्नेति.\n\nThe ई and ऊ must be of the 7th case. Therefore मति+टा (3rd S.) = मति+इ (letter homogeneous with the prior) = मती 'with wisdom'. Here _ī_ is in the sense of the instrumental case and is not _pragrihya_. Thus मती+इति = मतीति.\n\nThe word अर्य is used in the aphorism, in order to exclude the application of this rule to cases like the following. Thus in forming the compound of वाप्याम् \"in the well\" and अश्व \"horse\", the case-affix is elided, and we get वापी + अश्व. Here, no doubt, the word वापी is in the locative case, though the case-affix is elided; but we cannot say that the long ई of _vâpî_ has the sense of the locative. Here, therefore, we shall have _sandhi_; as, वाप्यश्वः \"the horse near the well.\" In other words, the present aphorism is not to apply to the final ई or ऊ of words standing as the prior member of a compound term (_pûrva_-_pada_); for words like वापी &c., in the above example, can never, by themselves and alone, denote the locative case; while words like गौरी, formed in the way described already, give the sense of the locative, even alone, though they be placed anywhere in a sentence.",
    "11020": "This defines the word _ghu_. Four verbs have the form of दा, or assume it by the application of (VI.1.45), and two, of धा; they are called घु. The _ghu_ verbs have certain peculiarities of conjugation to be described hereafter.\n\nThe घु verbs are the following:- डुदाञ् \"to give,\" as प्रणिददाति; दाण् \"to give,\" as, प्रणिदाता; दो \"to cut,\" as, प्रणिद्यति; देङ् \"to pity\" as, प्रणिदयते, डुधाञ् \"to place\" as प्रणिदधाति, धेट् to \"feed\" as, प्रणिधयति.\n\nIn the above examples, because of the verbs being घु, the न of प्रनि is changed into ण by (VIII.4.17).\n\nSimilarly दाप् \"to cut\" and दैप् \"to clean\" not being called घु, rules (VII.4.46) and (VII.4.47) do not apply to them. Thus दा+क्त = दातं 'what is cut,' as, दातं बर्हिः. So also अवदातं \"washed\" as, अवदातं मुखं \"a bright face.\" But with दा \"to give,\" &c. दा+क्त = दद्+त (VII.4.46) = दत्तः \"given;\" so also we have प्र+दा+क्त = प्रत्तम् (VII.4.47). The word घु occurs in _sûtra_ (VI.4.66), &c. The word _dåp_ includes also _daip_ by the _paribhâshâ_ given under (III.4.19), ऐ changed into आ by (VI.1.45).",
    "11021": "This is an _atidesa_ _sutra_ and consists of four words, आदि \"the beginning,\"  अन्त \"end,\" वत् \"like,\" एकस्मिन् \"in one;\" the literal translation being \"beginning is end-like in one.\" The affix वत् has the force of the locative, and the meaning is \"on the beginning,\" and \"on the end,\" i.e., let an operation be performed on a single letter, as upon an initial or upon a final. Thus by (III. 1. 3). an affix has _udatta_ or acute accent on its initial vowel. Thus the affix _tavya_ has accent on the first अ, and we have कर्त्तव्य॑म्. But when an affix consists of a single vowel, it is itself the beginning and the end, and, as such, will have the accent. As in औपगवम् _aupagavam_ the last _a_ has the accent, which _a_ represents the affix अण्.\n\nSimilarly, by (VII. 3. 102), the final of a base ending in short अ is lengthened before a case-affix beginning with a consonant of यञ् class. Thus राम + भ्याम् = रामाभ्याम्. This rule will apply when the word consists of one letter only, and that letter is a short अ. Thus अ + भ्याम् = आभ्याम् \"by those two.\" Here it must not be objected that the solitary अ is initial, and cannot be final.\n\nWhy do we say \"in one\"? If a word consists of more than one letter, then the beginning is not like the end. Thus in the word सभा the initial short अ is not like the final long आ; otherwise सभा would get the name of वृद्धम् (I. 1. 73), and the secondary derivative from सभासन्नयन would be formed by the affix छ् (IV. 2. 114). But this is not so, the affix अण् is employed instead, and the form is साभासन्नयनः.",
    "11022": "This _sutra_ defines घ affixes. They are two, तर and तम, the प् in them being इत्. The special use of these affixes will be described later on. These affixes are useful in forming the comparative and the superlative degrees respectively of adjectives, adverbs, &c. The base undergoes certain changes before these terminations, which will be treated of in its proper place.\n\nThus the words कुमारितरा and कुमारितमा are formed by adding the affixes तर and तम to the word or 'a girl,' whose long ई is shortened before these affixes by _sutra_ 43 of the third chapter of the 6th Book.",
    "11023": "This _sutra_ defines the word _sankhya_, or numeral.\n\nThese are certain words, besides the ordinary numerals, having some peculiarity of declension. The words like बहु 'many,' and गण 'class', and those that have the affixes वत् and अति after them, belong to this class. The letters उ and ड of वतु and डति are इत्, or indicatory, the actual affixes being वत् and अति.\n\nThe word _sankhya_ means \"numerals;\" and this class contains, among others, the Sanskrit numerals. The words formed by adding वतु are generally compound pronouns, e.g. तावत् \"so much,\" यावत् \"as much,\" एतावत् \"so much,\" similarly words formed by the affix डति, e.g. कति \"how many,\" तति \"so many,\" यति \"as many.\"\n\nThus बहु + कृत्वसुच् (V. 4. 17) = बहुकृत्वः \"many times\" the affix कृत्वसुच् being added only to _sankhya_ words in the sense of the repetition of the action. So also बहु + धा (V. 3. 42) = बहुधा \"in many ways.\" Here also the affix धा is added by virtue of बहु being a _sankhya_. Similarly बहुकः (V. 1. 22) \"purchased for a big sum,\" बहुशः (V. 4. 43) \"manifold.\" So also गणकृत्वः, गणधा, गणकः, गणशः; so also तावत्कृत्वः, तावद्धा, तावच्छः, कतिकृत्वः; कतिधा, कतिकः, कतिशः.\n\nWhen the words बहु and गण mean \"abundance\" and \"multitude\" they are not _sankhya_. It is only when they are expressive of numbers, that they get the designation of _sankhya_. The necessity of defining _sankhya_ arose in order to exclude such words as, भूरि \"numerous,\" &c., which though they express numbers, are not to be treated as \"numerals,\" technically so called.\n\nVart:- The word अर्द्ध \"half\" when standing as a first term in a compound number which takes an affix giving the sense of an ordinal, gets the designation of _sankhya_, for the purposes of the application of the rules of _samasa_ and of the affix कन्. The ordinal affixes or _purana_ _pratyayas_ are like डट् (V. 2. 48), मट् (V. 2. 49), थक् (V. 2. 51), &c. Thus एकादशः \"eleventh,\" पंचमः \"fifth,\" चतुर्थः \"fourth,\" &c. Similarly we have अर्द्धपंचशूर्पः \"purchased for 41\/2 baskets\" (a _dvigu_). Here अर्द्ध + पंचमा (an ordinal) = अर्द्धपंचम्, a _bahuvrihi_ compound meaning 41\/2, vis., that in which half is the fifth term. अर्द्धपंचमैः शूर्पैः क्रीतः = अर्द्धपंचमशूर्पः the _taddhita_ affixes ठञ् and अञ् required by (V. 1. 19) and (V. 1. 26) being elided by (V. 1. 28).\n\nHere, there is compounding (_dvigu_) by taking अर्द्धपंचमम् as a _sankhya_, and then applying _sutra_ (II. I. 51). The _samasa_ here is in the sense of _taddhita_, and this compounding is only possible by rules (II. 1. 50) and (II. 1. 51), when अर्द्धपंचमम् gets the appellation of _sankhya_. Having got this name, it forms _dvigu_ compound in the sense of the _taddhita_ affixes अञ् and ठञ् (V. 1. 26). The word शूर्प takes both these affixes in the sense of \"being bought with.\" Thus शौर्पिकम् and शौर्पम् both mean \"bought with a measure called _surpa_.\" In the above compound of अर्द्धपंचमशुर्पः the sense is that of the above-named _taddhita_; but the affixes have been elided by (V. 1. 28) after _dvigu_ compounds. So also we have अर्द्धपंचमकः by applying the affix कन्. For these two purposes, namely _samasa_ and the application of कन्, compounds of _ardha_, like _ardha_-_panchama_ are treated as _sankhya_.",
    "11024": "This _sutra_ defines the term षट् which is a subdivision of the larger group _sankhya_. Those _sankhyas_ which end in ष् or न् are called षट्. The word _sankhya_ is understood in this _sutra_, because the word ष्णान्ता is in the feminine gender, showing that it qualifies _sankhya_ which is also feminine.\n\nThe numerals that end in ष or न are six, namely पंचन् 'five,' षष् 'six,' सप्तन्, 'seven,' अष्टन् 'eight,' नवन् 'nine,' दशन् 'ten.'\n\nIt is one of the peculiarities of षट् words that they lose their nominative and accusative plural terminations (VII. I. 22). Thus षट् तिष्टन्ति, पंच गच्छन्ति ॥\n\nThe word अन्त in the _sutra_ shows that the letters ष and न must be _aupadesika_ i.e., must belong to the words as originally enunciated and not added afterwards as affix &c. Thus in शतानि 'hundreds, सहस्राणि 'thousands,' अष्टानाम् 'of eights' the न is not radical, but an augment, and therefore they are not षट् and the nominative and accusative plural terminations are not elided; as शतान् + इ = शतानि &c.",
    "11025": "This _sutra_ enlarges the scope of the definition of षट् by including in it, words formed by डति. By _sutra_ 22, words in डति are already _sankhya_; by this they are also षट्. Therefore we have कति पठन्ति, 'how many are reading,' कति पश्य 'see how many.' Here कति has lost its plural termination by (VII. 1. 22).",
    "11026": "This defines the _nishtha_ affixes, that is to say, the affixes of the past participle. The actual affixes are त, तवत्, the क and उ being indicatory. They being कित् are liable to all the rules applicable to कित् affixes, such as rule (1. 1.5). Thus we have, कृतः, कृतवान्, भुक्तः, भुक्तवान्.\n\nThe force of the indicatory उ in _ktavatu_ is, by (IV. 1. 6), to indicate that in forming the feminine of nouns ending in an affix having an indicatory vowel of _uk_ _pratyahara_ (उ, ऋ, लृ), the affix ङीप् (ई) must be added. Thus कृतवान् (masc.), कृतवती (fem.). The word _nishtha_ occurs in _sutra_ (VII. 2. 14).",
    "11027": "This defines _sarvanama_ or pronominals. To know what are the other words comprised in the phrase 'and the rest' we must refer to _Panini_'s _Ganapatha_ where a list of all groups referred to in the _sutras_, is given. Thus we know from it, that the following are _sarvanama_:--\n\nसर्व 'all,' विश्व 'all,' उभ 'two,' उभय 'both,' words formed by the affix डतर such as कतर 'which of two,' words formed by the affix डतम as कतम 'which of many,' अन्य 'other,' अन्यतर 'either,' इतर 'other,' त्वत् 'other,' त्व 'other,' नेम ' half,' सम 'all,' सिम 'whole,' त्यद् 'he, she, it,' तद् 'he, she, it,' यद् 'who,' एतद् 'this,' इदम् 'it,' अदस् 'that,' एक 'one,' द्वि 'two,' युष्मद् 'you,' अस्मद् 'I,' भवतु 'you,' किम् 'what.' So also पूर्व 'east,' 'prior,' पर 'subsequent,' अवर 'west or posterior,' दक्षिण 'south or right,' उत्तर 'north or inferior, subsequent,' अपर 'other or inferior,' अधर 'west or inferior,' are _sarvanamas_ when they imply a relation in time or place, as shown above, and not when they are names. So also रव when it does not mean a 'kinsman or a treasure,' but means 'own.' So also अन्तर when it means 'outer,' or 'an under or lower garment' is a _sarvanama_.\n\nThere are certain peculiarities in the declension of _sarvanama_ words. Thus सर्व though ending in अ, is not declined like नर which also ends in अ, the plural of सर्व being सर्वे, that of नर being नराः. Similarly the dative singular नराय, सर्वस्मै; the abl. sing. नरात्, सर्वस्मात्; the loc. sing. नरे, सर्वस्मिन्; the Gen. pl. नराणाम्, सर्वेषाम् &c.\n\nThe compounds (with certain exceptions) ending in these words are also _sarvanamas_. The word उभ 'both' is always used in the dual number as उभौ, उभाभ्याम्. The object of its being inserted in the list of pronominals, ( whilst its declension does not differ from that of नर), is its taking the augment अकच् (V.3.71) which it could not have taken, if it were not a pronominal as उभकौ. Another object gained by its being so called, is the application of (II. 3. 27), by which a pronominal may take the case-affix of the 3rd case or the 6th case in denoting cause.\n\nThere are two त्व in the above list, namely त्वत् and त्व, having the same meaning, and both ending in अ. But the final अ of one is _udatta_, and of the other _anudatta_. Some give one त्वत् only and not the other, and say that both have _anudatta_ accent. The word सम is a _sarvanama_, when it is synonymous with the word सर्व 'all,' and not when it means 'equality.' When it has the latter sense of 'equality,' it is declined like नर i.e. like ordinary words ending in अ, as _Panini_ himself indicates in (I. 3. 10), where he uses the regular genitive plural समानाम्, meaning 'among or of equals.' As a pronominal the genitive plural would have been समेषाम्.\n\nThe above words _sarva_ &c. are not to be treated as pronouns when they are used as appellatives. For example, if सर्व be the name of a person then it will be declined like ordinary nouns, as सर्वाय देहि 'give to _Sarva_ (a person'). Here the dative singular is regularly formed. Similarly when these words are so compounded with others as to lose their original independent character, namely when they are उपसर्जन, they are not treated as _sarvanama_, but follow the regular declension, as अतिसर्वाय देहि 'give to (him who is) above all.' Here in the compound अतिसर्व 'Above-all' or 'Supreme Being,' the word सर्व loses its independent character and defines and determines the sense of another word. Fuller explanation of the word _upasarjana_ will be given later on in (I. 2. 43). This term सर्वनाम is an अन्वर्थसंज्ञा that is a term the application of which accords with its meaning.",
    "11028": "This is an exception to _sutra_ (I. 1. 29) which follows. As a general rule (see _sutra_ (I. 1. 29)), in _bahuvrihi_ compounds, these words _sarva_ &c. are declined like ordinary nouns. The present _sutra_ declares an option to this, in special cases relating to compounds signifying direction. Thus the _bahuvrihi_ compound of direction उत्तरपूर्वा 'north-east' may form its dative case as a pronominal, e.g. उत्तरपूर्वस्यै or it may form its dative like ordinary words ending in आ, i. e. उत्तरपूर्वायै. So दक्षिणपूर्वस्यै or दक्षिणपूर्वायै.\n\nWhy do we say \"when signifying a direction\"? The next _sutra_ will enjoin that in _bahuvrihi_ compounds, these words are not treated as pronominals. Therefore, if in the present _sutra_, we had not used the word दिक्, it would have been impossible to know where there was option and where prohibition. By employing the word \"direction,\" it is thus determined, that in a _samasa_, relating to direction (II. 2. 26), there is allowed option, while there is prohibition in all other kinds of _bahuvrihi_ compounds.\n\nWhy do we say \"in compound\"? So that the option may be in that _bahuvrihi_ which is purely _samasa_, and in no other _bahuvrihi_. There is no option allowed in that _bahuvrihi_ where there is a semblance of _bahuvrihi_ but not exact _bahuvrihi_.\n\nThe quasi-_bahuvrihi_, or analogical _bahuvrihi_ compounds, or to use the Sanskrit phrase, _bahuvrihi_-_vadbhava_, is taught in _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 9). where words in repetition are treated like _bahuvrihi_. Thus एकं + एकं = एकैकम् 'one and one, each one.' _Bahuvrihi_ compounds are possessive compounds, but in the above example, no idea of possession enters. However the compound here is treated like a _bahuvrihi_, for the purposes of the elision of the case-affix of the first member, and the whole compound gets the designation of _pratipadika_. In compounds like this, therefore, which are _bahuvrihi_-_vat_, but not exactly _bahuvrihi_, the present rule and the succeeding _sutra_ do not apply. Thus एकैकस्मै देहि 'give to each one,' दक्षिणदक्षिणस्यै देहि ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"in the _bahuvrihi_\"? So that there may be no option in the _dvandva_ compound. Thus दक्षिणोत्तरपूर्वाणाम् 'of the south, north and east.' The prohibition in the case of _dvandva_ by rule 31 is absolute and invariable.",
    "11029": "As a general rule (see _sutra_ (I. 1. 72)), when any definition, rule, operation &c. is made applicable to a particular word, the same would also apply to any other word which ends in that word. Thus the plural of man being 'men' in English, the plural of blackman will be blackmen. So the definition of _sarvanama_ given to _sarva_ &c., separately, will also apply to the words ending in _sarva_ &c.\n\nThis _sutra_ introduces thus an exception to _sutra_ (I. 1. 27). In _bahuvrihi_ or possessive compounds, the nature of which compounds will be described later on, the above mentioned words are not pronominals, and must follow the ordinary rule of declension. Thus the compound प्रियविश्व meaning 'beloved of all' is a _bahuvrihi_ compound of प्रिय 'beloved,' and विश्व 'all,' (which is a _sarvanama_). The declension of this compound will follow the general rule. Thus, in the dative singular, we have प्रियविश्वाय, though the dative singular of विश्व by itself is विश्वस्मै, like other pronominals. So also प्रियोभयाय \"to him who is beloved of both.\" So also द्व्यन्याय, त्र्यन्याय &c.\n\nSimilarly in _bahuvrihi_ compounds, these words not being treated as pronominals, they do not take also the special affix अकच्, but the general affix कन्. As, त्वत्कपितृको, मत्कपितृको (V. 3. 70).\n\nThough the word _bahuvrihi_ was present in this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from the last aphorism, the object of using the word _bahuvrihi_ again in this _sutra_, is this :-- that the prohibition may apply to those expressions also which are no longer _bahuvrihi_, but whose original components were once _bahuvrihi_. Thus the words वस्त्रान्तरा and वसनान्तरा are _bahuvrihi_ compounds; but when these two words are further compounded into a _dvandva_ compound, the present rule still applies. As, वस्त्रान्तरावसनान्तराः ॥",
    "11030": "This is another exception to the definition of _sarvanama_. There is a class of compounds in Sanskrit_ called _tatpurusha_ compounds, in which the last word governs the preceding one. The word governed may be in any one of the six cases: when it is in the third or instrumental case, the compound is called _tritiya_ _tatpurusha_. When, therefore, there is such a _samasa_, the words mentioned in _sutra_ (I. 1. 26) are not to be declined like pronominals. Thus the word मासपूर्व is a compound of मास and पूर्व = मासेनपूर्व meaning 'prior by a month,' where the word _masa_ is in the instrumental case. This compound will be declined like ordinary words, e.g. its dative will be मासपूर्वाय, though the dative of पूर्व, when standing by itself, is पूर्वस्मै; so also संवत्सरपूर्वाय ॥\n\nThe _tritiya_-_samasa_ of the present _sutra_ has reference to the special _tritiya_-_samasa_ ordained by the particular _sutra_ (II. 1. 31). namely, \"that which ends with the 3rd case affix, is compounded with the words _purva_, _sadrisa_, _sama_, &c.\" and has not reference to the _tritiya_-_samasa_ in general, such as one ordained by (II. 1. 32),\" that which ends with the 3rd case-affix when it denotes the agent or the instrument is compounded diversely with what ends in a _krit_ affix.\" Therefore, in phrases त्वयका कृतं 'done by thee,' मयका कृतं 'done by me,' these words are treated as pronominals, though in the instrumental case followed by a word ending in a _krit_-affix. In other words, reading this _sutra_ with (II. 1. 31), we find that _purva_ is the only _sarvanama_ which is so compounded, and to which only the present _sutra_ would seem to apply.\n\nThe word समास may appear to have been mentioned redundantly, as it has already been mentioned in the previous _sutra_, the primary object of the _sutra_ authors being to shorten the rules by the keeping out of every unnecessary word. But here, the word समास has been repeated, to show that even in phrases like मासेन पूर्वाय, though not a compound, but used in construction with an instrumental case, the word पूर्व is not a _sarvanama_, that is to say, the prohibition extends even to phrases, which bear the sense of the instrumental compound, though not exhibited in the form of the instrumental compound.",
    "11031": "This _sutra_ mentions another exception. In collective compounds the above words are not _sarvanama_. _Dvandva_ is a compound in which two words are simply joined together, the compound taking the terminations of the dual or plural according to the number of compounded words, or the terminations of the singular, being treated as a collective term. Thus, the compound वर्णाश्रमेतर means, वर्ण 'the castes,' आश्रम 'the orders' and इतर 'the others'. The word इतर in this compound is not to be treated as a _sarvanama_, but an ordinary word. Therefore, in the genitive plural we have:-- वर्णाश्रमेतराणाम् and not ०इतरेषाम्. So also पूर्वापराणाम् 'of the priors and the posteriors.'\n\nThe word च 'and' in the _sutra_ indicates that it closes the list of exceptions or prohibitions that began with _sutra_ (I. 1. 29).",
    "11032": "This is a proviso to _sutra_ (I. 1. 31), and declares that before the termination जस् (which is the termination of the nominative plural, as we shall find later on, and which in the pronominals is replaced by शी), the _dvandva_ compounds may be treated either as _sarvanamas_ or as ordinary words. Thus the plural of वर्णाश्रमेतर may be either  वर्णाश्रमेतराः or ०तरे, that is, the word may take either जस् or शी.\n\nThis _sutra_ governs the four succeeding _sutras_. The option allowed in the case of the application of the affix Ist pl. to the _dvandva_ compounds of pronominals, does not extend to the _dvandva_ compounds of pronominal which take the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71). There the _sutra_ (I. 1. 31) is absolute. Thus, कतरः + कतमकः = कतरकतमकाः in the plural. This affix अक (अकच्) comes before the last vowel, with what follows it, of the pronominals and indeclinables.",
    "11033": "Thus we have प्रथमे or प्रथमाः, चरमे or चरमाः, अल्पे or अल्पाः, अर्द्धे or अर्द्धाः, कतिपये or कतिपयाः, नेमे or नेमाः, द्वितये or द्वितयाः ॥\n\nThe words \"optionally when the affix जस् follow\" are understood in this _sutra_. The governing force of the word \"_dvandva_\" does not extend to this, and stops at this. By the word तय in the aphorism, is meant words ending in the affix तय. The rest are _pratipadikas_ or crude bases. The word नेम has already been enumerated among the pronominals, therefore, the option in its case, is what is called _prapta_-_vibhasa_, the result of which will be that though in the nom. pl. it may be declined like नर, the rest of its declension is like _sarva_, while in the case of _prathama_ &c. the nom. pl. may be like _sarva_, but the rest of their declension must be like that of _nara_. The word _ubhaya_, has been formed by the addition of the affix तय, and it is already enumerated in the list of pronominals, therefore, by the present _sutra_ its nom. pl. admits of two forms.\n\nThe application of the affix _kan_ or _akach_ must depend upon the nature of these words, if pronominals, then _akach_, otherwise _kan_.",
    "11034": "These seven words have already been mentioned in the list of _sarvanamas_. They are always _sarvanamas_, when they have the meaning given to them in the list, i. e., when they imply a relation in time and space, but when used in any other sense than the one which has been determined or fixed for them, they are not _sarvanamas_, nor are they so when they are used as appellatives (संज्ञा). Thus, when the word दक्षिण means 'clever,' it is not a _sarvanama_, as, दक्षिणा इमे गायकाः 'these clever minstrels,' similarly in उत्तराः कुरवः 'the northern _Kurus_,' the word उत्तर is not a pronominal, for though it declares a direction, it is a proper noun.\n\nWhen these seven words are _sarvanama_, they are declined like _sarva_, except in the nominative plural, when they may be declined either as _sarvanamas_, or as ordinary nouns. The option allowed in the case of these words is a _praptavibhasa_.\n\nThat there is a 'specification' (_niyama_), or tacit implication, of a determinate point (_avadhi_), with reference to which something is to be described by the word itself, is what we mean when we say \"that a relation in time or place (_avastha_) is implied.\" For example, if we wish to describe Benares as being southern (_dakshina_), to do this, we may specify some point, say one of the peaks of the _Himalaya_ with reference to which Benares may be described as a \"place to the southward.\" Again we in the north may thus speak of the people to the south of the _Vindhya_ mountains, as being southern, not with reference to the inhabitants of Ceylon, but with reference (as every one here understands by tacit implication) to us ourselves, who live to the north the _Vindhya_ range. Thus, (पूर्वे or पूर्वाः, अवरे or अवराः, परे or पराः) दक्षिणे or दक्षिणे or दक्षिणाः; उत्तराः; अपरे or अपराः; अधरे or अधराः.",
    "11035": "The word स्व when it does not mean a ज्ञाति 'kinsman' or धन 'property' or 'wealth' is always a _sarvanama_, in every number and case, as it has been enumerated among the pronominals, except in the nominative plural where it is optionally so. Thus स्वे पुत्त्राः or स्वाः पुत्राः 'one's own sons,' स्वे गावः or स्वा गावः 'one's own cows'.\n\nBut when it means 'kinsmen' or 'articles of property' स्वाः alone is the nom. pl. As, स्वा ज्ञातयो 'these kinsmen' प्रभूताः स्वाः 'much riches'.",
    "11036": "The word अन्तर when it means बहिर्योग, viz., 'outer' is always _sarvanama_, so also, when it means उपसंव्यान or 'a lower garment.' Thus, अन्तरे गृहाः or अन्तरा गृहाः 'outer houses, the residence of _Chandal_, and other low castes.' So अन्तरे or अन्तराः शाटकाः \"the inner garments, such as petticoats worn under the upper garments.\" The word अन्तर when used in the above sense is always _sarvanama_, but in the nominative plural, it is optionally so. But, when it is not used in the above senses, it is never a _sarvanama_, e. g., ग्रामयोरंतरे वसति 'he lives between the two villages,' where the regular locative is अन्तरे. With this _sutra _ ends the section on _sarvanamas_, which began with _sutra _ (I. 1. 26).\n\nVart:- The word अन्तर when qualifying the word पुरि 'a city,' is not to be treated as a _sarvanama_, and is, therefore, declined like ordinary nouns. As, अन्तरायां पुरि वसति 'he lives out of the city.'\n\nVart:- The words formed by the affix तीय such as, द्वितीय and तृतीय, are optionally declined as _sarvanama_ before the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ (ङित्), which are the singular terminations of dative, ablative, genitive and locative, as, द्वितीयस्मै or द्वितीयाय, तृतीयाय or तृतीयस्मै.",
    "11037": "This defines _avyaya_ or indeclinables. The words स्वर् &c. must be found out from the _Ganapatha_; they are the following:--\n\nस्वर् 'heaven,' अन्तर् 'midst,' प्रातर् 'in the morning,' पुनर् 'again,' सनुतर् 'in concealment,' उच्चैस् 'high, aloft' नीचैस् 'low down,' शनैस् 'slowly,' ऋधक् 'rightly, separately, aside, singly, particularly, truly,' ऋते 'except, without,' युगपत् 'at the same time, at once,' आरात् 'near, far from, directly.' पृथक् 'separately, apart,' ह्यस् 'yesterday,' श्वस् 'to-morrow,' दिवा 'by day,' रात्रौ 'by night or in the night,' सायम् 'at eve,' चिरम् 'long, long since, a long time,' मनाक् 'a little,' ईषत् 'slightly, a little,' शश्वत् 'ever,' जोषम् 'gladly,' तूष्णीम् 'silently,' बहिस् 'outside,' अविस् 'below, without, outside.' समया 'near,' निकषा 'near, hard, close by,' स्वयम् 'of one's self,' वृथा 'in vain,' नक्तम् 'at night, by night,' नञ् 'negative particle, not,' हेतौ 'for this reason, by reason of,' इद्धा 'truly, really' हे ह 'exclamation,' अद्धा 'evidently, truly,' सामि 'half,'  वत बत 'enclitic like, as _Brahmanavat_, priestly,' सनत् सनात् 'perpetually,' उपधा 'division,' तिरस्  'crookedly, awry, over,' अन्तरा, अन्तरेण 'except, without' ज्योक, योक 'long,' कम् 'expletive particle,' शम् 'ease,' सना 'perpetually,' सहसा 'suddenly, hastily,' विना 'without,' नाना 'variously,' स्वस्ति 'greeting, peace,' स्वधा 'exclamation, oblation to Manes,' अलम् 'enough,' वषट् 'exclamation,' श्रौषट्, वौषट् (interjection) 'oblation of butter,' अन्यत् 'again, moreover, otherwise.' अस्ति 'being present,' उपांशु 'in a low voice, secretly, privately,' क्षमा 'patience, pardon,' विहायसा 'aloft in the air,' दोषा 'at night or in the evening,' मृषा, मिथ्या 'falsely,' मुधा 'in vain,' पुरा 'formerly,' मिथो or मिथस् 'mutually, together,' प्रायस् 'frequently, almost,' मुहुस् 'again, repeatedly' उवाहकम् or उवाहिका 'at the same time,' आर्यहलम् 'violently' अभीक्ष्णम् 'repeatedly,' साकम् or सार्धम् 'with' नमस्, 'reverence,' हिरुक् 'without,' धिक् 'fie!' अथ 'thus,' प्रताम् 'with fatigue,' प्रशान् 'alike,' प्रतान् 'widely,' मा, माङ 'do not.'\n\nSo, also the words formed by the affixes _ktva_ _tosun_, _kasun_, by the _krit_ affixes ending in म् or ए, ऐ, ओ or औ, and the _avyayibhava_ compounds, are indeclinables. So, also the words formed by the affixes beginning with तसिल् (V. 3. 7) and ending with पाशप् (V. 3. 47), by the affixes beginning with शस् (V. 4. 4.2) and ending with समासांतः (V. 4. 68), by the affixes कृत्वसुच्, सुच्, आच् and थाल् by the affixes having the sense of the affix च्वि, or by the affixes अम् or आम्, तसि or वति, न or नाञ् are also indeclinables.\n\nThe words called _nipata _ will be given under _sutras_, (I. 4. 56) to (I. 4. 61). Thus a word which changes not (न व्येति), remaining alike in the three genders and in all cases, and in all numbers, is what is termed an अव्यय or indeclinables.",
    "11038": "This expands the definition of _avyaya_. There are three words in the _sutra_ _taddhitah_, _cha_ and _asarva_-_vibhaktih_. _Taddhitas_ or secondary affixes are certain affixes, by which nouns are derived from other nouns, such as, from मनु we have मानवः, _sarva_-_vibhaktis_ are those words which take all case-terminations, _asarva_-_vibhaktis_ are those which do not take all _vibhaktis_ but some only. Thus the adverb यतः is declined in the singular ablative only, and does not take the dual and plural terminations.\n\nThose derivative words which do not take all the case-terminations, but only some of them and which are formed by the addition of _Taddhita_ affixes are indeclinables. As ततः 'thence,' तत्र 'there.' Both these words are formed by _taddhita_ affixes from the pronoun तद् 'that,' the one is used in the ablative case only and the other in the locative. So also यतः, यत्र, तदा, यदा, सर्वदा &c.",
    "11039": "All affixes for the formation of nouns are of two kinds:-1. Those by which nouns are derived directly from roots: Primary affixes. 2. Those by which nouns are derived from other nouns: Secondary affixes. The former are called _krit_, the latter, _taddhita_.\n\nWords formed by _krit_ affixes which end in म or ए, ओ, ऐ, or औ (connoted by the _pratyahara_  एच्) are _avyayas_. Thus the affix तुम् (technically तुमुन्) and अम् (technically णमुल्, (III. 3. 10)) are affixes which end in म्. The words formed by the addition of these affixes will be indeclinables. Thus दातुम् 'to give,' and स्मारम् 'remembering' are _avyayas_. So also words like जीवसे 'to live,' पिवध्यै 'to drink,' are also _avyayas_ as they end in ए, &c.\n\nThus, in the following examples, the words within quotation are _avyayas_ 'स्वादुंकारं,' 'संपन्नंकारं,' 'लवणंकारं,' भुङ्क्ते, 'he eats first having made it relishing' (III. 4. 26). \"वक्षे\" रायः ( वच् + से  (III. 4. 9) = वक्षे ); ता 'वामेषे,' रथनामुर्वीम् गव्युतिमेषां ( इ + से = एषे. _Rig_ __Veda_  V. 66. 3). अस्मे शतं शरदो 'जीवसे' धा अस्मे वीराञ्छ्श्वत इंद्र शिप्रिन् (_Rig_ __Veda_  III. 36. 10). आपः पृणीत भेषजं वरूथं तन्वे मम । ज्योक् च सूर्य्यं 'दृशे,' (_Rig_ __Veda_  I. 25. 21,  दृश् + केन् III. 4. II दृशे).\n\nThe word अन्त is used in this _sutra_ for the same purpose, as it was employed in _sutra_ (I. 1. 24), showing that these terminations must be '_aupadesika_,' and not derivative. Therefore the following words are not _avyayas_:-- आधये (d, s.), आधेः (g.s.) चिकीर्षवे । चिकीर्षोः । कुम्भकारेभ्यः । नगरकारेभ्यः ॥",
    "11040": "As कृत्वा 'having done' उदेतोः 'having risen,' विसृपः 'having spread.' Thus in the following examples the words within quotation are indeclinables:-- पुरासूर्य 'स्योदेतो' राधेयः । पुरावत्साना 'मपाकर्त्तोः' । पुराक्रूरस्य 'विसृपोः' विरप्सिन्नु दादाय पृथवीं जीवदानुम् ॥ (_Yajur_ _Veda_ . I. 28) य ऋते चिदभिश्रिषः पुरा जर्तृभ्यः ' आतृदः' । (_Rig_ _Ved_. VIIIa. I. 12).",
    "11041": "The _Avyayibhava_ or adverbial or indeclinable compounds are formed by joining an indeclinable particle with another word. The resulting compound, in which the indeclinable particle forms generally the first element, is again indeclinable, and generally ends, like adverbs, in the ordinary terminations of the nominative or accusative neuter. Thus अधिहरि 'upon _Hari_,' अनुरूपं 'after the form i.,e., accordingly.'\n\nThe word च in the _sutra_ shows that here ends the definition of _avyaya_. The _avyayas_, therefore, are all those words which are comprised in the above five _sutras_.\n\nWhat is the object gained by making the _avyayibhava_ compounds _avyayas_? Three objects are gained, by making these compounds, indeclinables, viz., we can apply to them (1) the rule relating to the elision (लुक्) of the case affixes and feminine affixes, i.e., _sutra_ (II. 4. 82) thus, in the following example, the words _upagni_ and _pratyagni_ though qualifying the word _salavah_, do not take the gender and number of the latter, उपाग्नि प्रत्यग्नि शलाभाः पतन्ति (2) the rule relating to accent when an _avyaya_ is compounded with the word _mukha_, (मुख स्वर), i.e., _sutras_ (VI. 2. 167) & (VI. 2. 168). Thus, उपाग्नि मु॑खः, here, sutra (VI. 2. 167), required the final vowel to take the _udatta_ accent, but the preceding word being an _avyaya_, _sutra_ (VI. 2. 168), intervened, and the first word retains its natural accent: (3) the rule relating to the change of _visarga_ : into स्, this change being technically called उपचारः thus उपपयःकारः, उपपयःकामः, as compared with अयस्कारः Here, the compound उपपयः being treated as _avyaya_ _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 46), applies and prevents the change of: into स्.\n\nThe four _sutras_ (I. 1. 38), (I. 1. 39), (I. 1. 40), and (I. 1. 41) have all been enunciated under the _svaradigana_. see _sutra_ (I. 1. 37). These _sutras_ properly, therefore, belong to the _ganapatha_; their repetition here in the _Ashtadhyayi_ indicates that these rules are अनित्य or not of universal application, viz., all rules relating to _avyayas_ in general, do not apply to them. Thus (II. 3. 69). declaring that the genitive case is not used along with an _avyaya_ is not a rule of universal application, for we see indeclinables like उदेतोः governed by the genitive case as, सूर्यस्योदेतोः; or क्रूरस्य विसृपः.",
    "11042": "This defines the word _sarvanamasthana_. The affix शि is the nominative and accusative plural termination of neuter nouns. It replaces the ordinary nominative and accusative plural affixes जस् and शस् used in every other gender. The श्र of शि is servile, and the actual termination is इ; the peculiarity of the affix शि is that it lengthens the penultimate vowel (VI. 4. 8) and adds a न् (VII. 1.72). Thus the plural of फल 'fruit' is फलानि 'fruits.' So also कुण्डानि तिष्ठन्ति, and कुण्डानि पश्य. Here, there is no difference of form in the nominative and the accusative cases. So also मधूनि, त्रपूणि, जतूनि. The word _sarvanamasthana_ occurs in _sutra_ (VI. 4. 8).",
    "11043": "This defines further the word _sarvanamasthana_. The case-terminations in Sanskrit are 21 as arranged below:-\n\n- Nominative प्रथमा सु (स्) औ जस् (अस्)\n- Accusative द्वितीया अम् औट् शस् (अस्)\n- Instrumental तृतीया टा (आ) भ्याम् भिस्\n- Dative चतुर्थी ङे (ए) भ्याम् भ्यस्\n- Ablative पंचमी ङसि (अस्) भ्याम् भ्यस्\n- Genitive षष्ठी ङस् (अस्) ओस् आम्\n- Locative सप्तमी ङि (इ) ओस् सुप् (सु)\n\nThe above are the 21 _vibhaktis_, the ज् of जस्, the श् of शस्, the ट् of औट् &c. are indicatory. All these _vibhaktis_ are included in the _pratyahara_ सुप् formed by taking the first _vibhakti_ and the last letter of the last _vibhakti_. Similarly the first five terminations (सु. औ, जस्, अम् and औट्) are represented by सुट् and are called _sarvanamasthana_ in the masculine and feminine genders. In the declension of nouns, it will be seen, that some nouns have two bases, one before these _sarvanamasthana_ and the other before the rest.\n\nThus the word राजन् 'king' has the base राजान् before the सुट् _vibhaktis_, while in the remaining cases, the base is राज्ञ् and राज as:-\n\n- Nominative राजा राजानौ राजानः\n- Accusative राजानम् राजानौ राज्ञः\n- Instrumental राज्ञा राजभ्यां राजभिः\n\nBut in the neuter nouns there is no such difference.",
    "11044": "This _sutra _ defines the word विभाषा. We had already had occasion to use this word in _sutras_ (I. 1. 28) and (I. 1. 32). Where there is a prohibition as well as an alternative course left open, it is called option or _vibhasha_. The commentators mention three kinds of _vibhasha_:- _prapta_-_vibhasha_., _aprapta_-_vibhasha_ and _praptaprapta_-_vibhasha_. The first occurs where there is a general rule already given, and then follows the optional rule; the second belongs to that class where there is no such general rule, but there is an optional rule, the third is intermediate between the two.\n\nThus the root श्वि, 'to swell,' by virtue of the rule  विभाषा श्वे (V. 1. 30), forms its perfect tense, either by _samprasarana_, or in the ordinary way. Thus the third person singular is either शुशाव or शिश्वाय.",
    "11045": "This defines the word _samprasarana_. It is the name given to the change of semi-vowels into vowels. The _pratyahara_ _ik_ includes the four simple vowels ई, उ, ऋ and लृ, and their corresponding semi-vowels are य्, व्, र्, and ल् included in the _pratyahara_ _yan_. The word _samprasarana_ is properly the name of the vowel which has replaced the semi-vowel. Thus the past participle of स्वप् 'to sleep,' is formed by adding the _nishtha_ affix क्त (see _sutra_ (I. 1. 26)). So that we have स्वप् + त. But there is a rule (VI. 1. 15) by which there is samprasarana of the व of स्वप् before the कित् affixes, and we have the form सुप्तः 'slept.' Similarly from वद् - उदितः, यज् - इष्टम्, व्यध् - विद्धः, ग्रह् – गृहीतम् – प्रछ्- पृष्टम्. The term _samprasarana_ is also employed to designate the whole process of the change of the semi-vowels into vowels as in (VI. 1. 13); (VI. 4. 131).",
    "11046": "This _sutra_ explains the special use of two of the indicatory letters ट् and क्. Where the indicatory letter of an augment is ट् that augment is to be placed before the word in the genitive case with regard to which it is enjoined; while a कित् augment is to be added after the word exhibited in the 6th case with regard to which it is enjoined. Thus, there is a _sutra _ (VII. 2. 35) which says \"_ardhadhatuka_ affixes beginning with a consonant except य, have इट्\". The question may arise where is this इट् to be added, in the beginning or the end or the middle of the _ardhadhatuka_ affix? This _sutra _ answers the question. The indicatory ट् shows, that it is to be placed before the _ardhadhatuka_ affix. Thus the future termination स्यति, is an _ardhadhatuka_ affix: when this is added to the root, it takes the augment इट्. Thus भू + इट् + स्यति = भविष्यति, 'he will be.' Similarly लविता 'he will cut'.\n\nSimilarly by _sutra _ (VII. 3. 40.) the root भी takes the augment षुक् in forming the causative. This having an indicatory क् is to be added after the word भी, as, भी + षुक् + णिच् + त = भीषयते 'he frightens.'",
    "11047": "This _sutra _ explains the use of the indicatory म्. The augments having an indicatory म्, technically called मित् augments, are placed immediately after the final vowel of a word. Thus there is an augment called नुम्, in which उ and म् are इत्, and the actual augment is न्. When, therefore, it is said \"let नुम् be added to the word,\" the letter न् is added after the last vowel. Thus the plural of पयस् 'milk' is formed in the following way :- पयस् + नुम् + इ (VII. 1. 72) = पयान्सि (VI. 4. 8). Here न् is added between य and स् i.e. after the अ of य, which is the final vowel of the word: and before this न् at the preceding short vowel is lengthened. Similarly मुच् + श + ति (III. 1. 77) = मुच् + नुम् + श + ति (VI. 1. 59) = मुञ्चति । Similarly विरुणद्धि.\n\nThe word अचः is in the genitive case, having the force of _nirdharana_ or specification; it has the force of the plural, though exhibited in the singular, being taken as representing the class. The meaning is 'among the vowels.' This _sutra_ is an exception to _sutras_ (I. 1. 49) and (III. 1. 2), by which an affix is added at the end of the word exhibited in the 6th case.\n\nThere is, however, an exception, in the case of the root मस्ज्, in which the augment नुम् is added not after the last vowel अ of म, but between स् and ज्. The result of adding the augment नुम् between स् and ज् is, that _sutra_ (VIII. 2. 29.) applies, and the स् is elided. Thus मस्ज् + ता = मस्ज् + नुम् + ता (VII. 1. 60) = मस्न्ज् + ता = मञ्ज् + ता (VII. 2. 29) = मङ्क्ता \"He will immerse\". So also मग्नः 'immersed,' मग्नवान्, मङ्क्तुम्.",
    "11048": "This _sutra_ points out the हृस्व substitutes of एच्. We know there are short and long vowels in Sanskrit, but properly speaking the एच् vowels have no corresponding short vowels. Therefore, when, in any rule, एच् vowels are told to be shortened, this _sutra_ declares that the short vowels of ए and ऐ, ओ and औ, for the purposes of the rule, will be इ and उ respectively. Thus, (I. 2. 47) declares:-- \"the short vowel is the substitute in the neuter of a crude form provided it end in a vowel.\" Therefore in compounding अति + रै, the ऐ must be shortened. Properly speaking ऐ has no short vowel corresponding to it, but by virtue of this _sutra_, इ supplies the place of such a short vowel, and we have अतिरि 'extravagant' so नौ, अतिनु 'disembarked or landed,' गो, उपगु 'near a cow.' All _avyayibhava_ compounds are neuter (II. 4. 18).\n\nWhy do we say 'of एच्'? Because the short of other vowels will not be इक्. Thus the short of आ is अ. As, अति = खट्वा = अतिखट्वः, अति + माला = अतिमालः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when short is to be substituted?' Because when प्लुत or prolated vowels are to be substituted for एच्, the इक् will not be the substitute. As देवदत्त _O_ _Devadatta_ ! देवद३त्त !",
    "11049": "This _sutra_ explains the mode of interpreting words used in the possessive case (sixth case) in the _sutras_ of _Panini_. The genitive case or _shashthi_ denotes many sorts of relations in Sanskrit, such as causation, possession, relation in place, comparison, nearness, proximity, change, collection, component member, &c. So that when a word is in the genitive case in a _sutra_ generally, the doubt may arise in what sense that genitive is to be used. This aphorism lays down the restrictive rule for the interpretation of such words. It says that the force of such genitive is to convey the meaning of 'in the place of.'\n\nThus in the _sutra_ (I. 1. 3), the word इक् is in the genitive case; the literal translation being :- \"of _ik_ there is _guna_ and _vriddhi_.\" But \"of\" here means by virtue of the present rule of interpretation \"in the place of.\" So that the _sutra_ means 'in the place of इक्.' Similarly in the _sutra_ immediately preceding this, viz. (I. 1. 48), we have the word एच् in the genitive case and the _sutra_ means 'of एच्.' Here also \"of\" means \"in the place of.\"\n\nThus in _sutra_ हन्तेर्ज (VI. 4. 36) 'of _hanti_, there is ज्' the word हन्ते, is the genitive of हन्ति; this genitive is used generally and its force is that of \"in the place of.\" Therefore, ज् displaces the verb हन् in लोट् or imperative mood, and we have the जहि 'kill thou.'\n\nThis _sutra_ is also thus translated by Dr. Kielhorn :- Only that which is enunciated in a rule, i.e. that which is read in a rule or rather that which in the real language is like that which is read in a rule in a genitive case, or that which forms part of that which is enunciated in a genitive case, assumes the peculiar relation denoted by the word स्थान 'place' i. e, is that in the place of which some thing else is substituted, but some thing suggested by the former does not assume that relation.\n\nThe word स्थान here is synonymous with प्रसङ्ग or 'occasion.' Thus in the sentence दर्भाणां स्थाने शरैः प्रस्तरितव्यम्, the word _sthane_, means 'prasange' i. e. wherever there is occasion to spread _darbha_ grass, spread there the _sara_ instead. Similarly in _sutras_ अस्तेर्भूः (II. 4. 52), or ब्रुवो वचिः (II. 4. 53), the words '_asti_,' and '_bru_' are in the genitive case, and mean, 'wherever there arises occasion to use the verbs अस् or ब्रू use there the verbs भू or वच् instead respectively.' Thus भविता, भवितुम्, भवितव्यम्, are the future, gerund, and passive participle respectively of अस्; so also, वक्ता, वक्तुम् and वक्तव्यम् are the same forms of ब्रू.  \n\nThe word स्थानेयोगा is a _bahuvrihi_ compound of two words, not in apposition, (_vyadhikarana_ _bahuvrihi_, see (II. 2. 248) (II. 2. 35)), and it qualifies the word _shashthi_. The compound means स्थाने योगोऽस्या, 'that which assumes the peculiar relation denoted by the word _sthana_.' Consequently the seventh case-affix is not elided in this compound; on the analogy of compounds like कण्ठेकालः &c.",
    "11050": "This _sutra_ also lays down another rule of _paribhasha_. To explain this we must take an example. The _guna_ of इ, उ, ऋ, and लृ, is अ, ए, ओ. There is nothing to specify what letter is the _guna_ of what. It might be said that ओ is the _guna_ of इ because the definitions as laid down up to so far, do not say anywhere that ओ is not the _guna_ of इ. So that when in a word like चि we are told 'let there be the _guna_ of इ' we do not know what specific _guna_ letter is to be substituted, whether it is अ, ए or ओ. To clear up this doubt, this _sutra_ declares that the likest of its significates is to be substituted. Now the nearest in place to इ is ए, both having their place of pronunciation, the palate. Similarly ओ is the _guna_ of उ, because both are labials.\n\nThere are four sorts of proximity or nearness :-(1) nearness in place or स्थान (i.e. palate, throat &c.); (2) nearness in meaning or अर्थ (such as, singular terminations to be used after words used in the sense of singular); (3) nearness in quantity or प्रमाण (such as a short vowel to replace a short vowel, a long vowel, a long one); (4) nearness in quality or गुण (such as aspirates to replace aspirates, and sonants to replace sonants). Of all these approximates the first vis., the nearness in the organ of utterance has preference, in the selection of proper substitute.\n\n(1). Thus in applying rule (VI. 1. 101), \"when a homogeneous vowel follows _ak_, the corresponding long vowel is the substitute for both,\" we must have recourse to the present _sutra_ for finding the proper vowel. Thus - दण्ड + अग्रं = दण्डग्रं; here the substitution of the long आ, for the two short अ's, is an example of substitution by nearness of place, for both अ and आ are gutturals.\n\n(2). A good example of substitution by the sense of the word is afforded by (VI. 1. 63):- \"The words पद्, दत्, नस् &c., are the substitutes when the case-affixes शस् (acc.-pl.) &c., follow.\" Here, we know the substitutes, but we do not know of what they are the substitutes. We apply the maxim of अर्थतः \"that only can become a substitute which has the power to express the meaning of the original, i. e., a substitute takes the place of that the meaning of which it is able to express.\" Thus we find that पद् is the substitute of पाद, दत् of दन्त, नस् of नासिका, &c., which convey the same meaning and contain almost the same letters. Another example of this is afforded by (VI. 3. 34), by which feminine words in a compound are changed into masculine. Thus वातण्डी (fem) + युवती = वातण्ड्ययुवतिः.\n\n(3). An example of prosodial substitution (प्रमाणतः) is afforded by rule (VIII. 2. 80), \"उ is the substitute of what comes after the द् of अदस् not ending in स् and in the room of द् there is म्.\" Thus अम + स्मै = अम् + अस्मै = अमुष्मै; अम + भ्याम् = अमा + भ्याम् (VII. 3. 102) = अम् + ऊभ्याम् = अमूभ्याम्. Here, short उ replaces the short अ, and the long ऊ replaces the long आ.\n\n(4). An illustration of qualitative substitution is afforded by (VII. 3. 52), \"a letter of the guttural class is substituted for च् and ज् when an affix having an indicatory घ् follows.\" Applying the rule of गुणतः we find that क् which is an _alpaprana_ and _aghosha_ letter replaces च् having the same quality; while ज् which is _ghosha_, and _alpaprana_ is replaced by the letter ग् possessing similar quality. Thus पच् + घञ् (III. 3. 18) = पाकः; त्यज् + घञ् = त्यागः; रञ्ज् + घञ् = रागः ॥\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of the word _sthana_ was understood in this _sutra_ from the last, the repetition of this word indicates the existence of the following _paribhasha_ :-\n\nWherever there exist several kinds of proximity between that for which something else shall be substituted, and its possible substitutes, there the proximity as to the organ of speech is weightier than the rest, i. e., there that only is substituted which is nearest as regards the organs of speech with which both are uttered.\n\nThus in finding the _guna_ substitutes of इ and उ out of the three _guna_ letters अ, ए and ओ, we find that अ is a proximate substitute having regard to prosodial measure, i. e., अ and इ and उ have all one _matra_; while having regard to the proximity of the organ of utterance, we get ए and ओ; the latter however prevails to the exclusion of the first; as चेता, स्तोता.\n\nWhy do we use the word \"likest\" in the superlative degree? Where there are many sort of proximities, the likest must be taken. Thus वाक् + हसति = वाग्घसति. Here, by (VIII. 4. 62), \"after a letter of झय् class, ह् is changed into a letter homogeneous with the preceding,\" ह् must be changed into a letter of the class क्. Out of the five letters of this class, ख् and ह् are both aspirates, but ख् is hard, and ह् is soft; so ग् an ह् are both soft, but ग् is unaspirate, and is ह् aspirate, therefore these must be rejected; the only letter which has the nearest approach to ह्, is घ्, which is both soft and aspirate. Similarly in त्रिष्टुब्भसति, the ह has been changed into भ.",
    "11051": "This _sutra_ consists of three words viz., उः which is the genitive singular of ॠ and means literally 'of ॠ' or 'in the place of ॠ'; the second word is अण्, a _pratyahara_ denoting अ, इ and उ long and short; the third word is रपरः which qualifies अण् and means 'having a र after.'\n\nThis _sutra_ is useful in fixing the proper substitutes of ॠ. Thus, there are only three _guna_ vowels अ, ए and ओ. Of these what is the proper _guna_ for ॠ? By the application of the rule of 'nearness of place' we see that अ is the nearest substitute. So that अ is the _guna_ of ॠ; and further by this rule, this अ must have a र् after it. Thus though technically speaking अ is the _guna_ of ॠ, the actual substitute is अर्. Thus कृ + ता = कर्त्ता; similarly हर्ता.\n\nSo also when ॠ is replaced by इ as by _sutra_ (VII. 1. 100), this substitute इ must be followed by a र्. As कॄ + अति = कि + र् + अति = किरति 'he scatters;' similarly गिरति 'he swallows.'\n\nSo also when ॠ is replaced by उ, as by _sutra_ (IV. 1. 115) this उ must be followed by a र्. As द्वि + मातृ + अण् = द्वैमातुरः 'son of two mothers'\n\nThis र् is to be added only when ॠ is replaced by अ, इ or उ (अण्) vowels, and not when it is replaced by any other letter.\n\nThus by (IV. 1. 97), \"the ॠ of the word सुधातृ is replaced by अक् (technically अकङ्) when the affix इञ् is added.\" Thus, सुधातृ + इञ् = सुधात् + अक् + इ = सौधातकिः, 'a descendant of _Sudhatri_' Here the substitute of ॠ, that is to say, the syllable अक् is not followed by र्.\n\nThe र in the text has been taken by some to be a _pratyahara_ formed by the letter र् and अ of लण्; and thus it includes the letters र् and ल्. In that case the _sutra_ would mean that अण् substitutes of ॠ and लृ are always followed by र् and ल् respectively. Thus _guna_ of _ri_ = _ar_, of _li_ = _al_.",
    "11052": "The rule of substitution by nearness of place applies to the last letter of the word which is exhibited in the genitive case and not to all its letters. Thus by _sutra_ (VII. 2. 102), it is declared त्यदादीनामः \"in the place of त्यद् &c., there is अ.\" It does not mean that the whole word त्यद्, is replaced by अ; though at first sight it may appear to mean so; but it means, by virtue of the present explanatory _sutra_, that the last letter of त्यद्, namely द् is to be replaced by अ.\n\nSo also in _sutra_ (I. 2. 50) इद्रगोण्याः the short इ replaces only the final letter of गोणी and not the whole word, as पंचगोणिः 'purchased for five _gonis_.' दशगोणिः",
    "11053": "This _sutra_ is an exception by anticipation to _sutra_ (I. 1. 55). By that all substitutes, consisting of more than one letter, replace the whole word.\n\nThus in forming the _dvandva_ compound of मातृ and पितृ there is a rule (VI. 3. 25) by which it is declared:- 'In the place of words ending in ॠ there is the substitution of आनङ् in forming _dvandvas_.' Now the substitute आनङ् is a ङित् substitute, and therefore it applies to the last letter of the word and not to the whole word, vis, the ॠ of मातृ is only changed into आ and not the whole word; and we have the compound मातापितरौ, so also होतापोतारौ.\n\nThere is an exception, however, in the case of the substitute तातङ् (VII. 1. 35) which, though it has an indicatory ङ्, yet replaces the whole expressions तु and हि and not only their finals. As जीवतात् 'may he live, or may you live'; instead of जीवतु 'may he live,' or जीव 'live thou.'",
    "11054": "When any operation is to be made in a word following another, such operation is to be made in the initial letter of such subsequent word. To give an illustration:- there is a rule (VI. 3. 97) by which it is declared: \"In the place of अप् used after the words द्वि and अन्तर् and the particles called उपसर्ग there is ई.\" This rule may be stated in other words as:- 'In the place of अप् there is ई when अप् follows द्वि or अन्तर्.' Now it is clear that ई is not to replace all the letters of अप् but only one. By _sutra_ (I. 1. 52) that letter would have been the last letter of अप्, but this _sutra_ makes an exception, namely, where an operation is directed to be made in a word, simply by reason of its being placed after another word; such change is to be made in the beginning of such second word. Therefore, the ई replaces the अ of अप् and we have द्वि + अप् = द्वीपं (the final अ is added by (V. 4. 74)) 'an island,' आन्तरीपं 'promontory.' So also in the _sutra_ ईदासः (VII. 2. 83) 'long ई is the substitute of अन when the latter comes after the root आस्.' Thus आस् + अन = आस् + ईन = आसीनः. Here also the ई replaces the initial अ of अन.\n\nHow can we find when an operation is to be performed on a subsequent word? When the previous word is exhibited in the 5th or ablative case, see _sutra_ (I. 1. 67).",
    "11055": "This _sutra _ is an exception to _sutra_ (I. 1. 52) by which it was declared that an _adesa_ or substitute replaces only the last letter. This _sutra_ on the contrary enjoins that an _adesa_ consisting of more than one letter replaces the whole expression in the genitive case, and not only its last letter. Even where an _adesa_ consists of a single letter, but if it has a श् as its indicatory letter, it replaces the whole word.\n\nThus, there is a _sutra_ ब्रुवो वचिः (II. 4. 53) which means 'in the place of ब्रू let there be वच्. Here the _adesa_ वच् consists of three letters (more than one), and therefore, it replaces the whole word ब्रू and not only the last letter ऊ. That is to say in forming certain tenses the verb ब्रू is replaced by वच्. Thus the future tense of ब्रू is वक्ता 'he will speak.' \n\nSo also there is a _sutra_ (V. 3. 3.) by which it is declared:-- \"In the place of इदम् there is इश्.\" Here the _adesa_ इ is an _adesa_ having the श् for its indicatory letter, and though it consists of only one letter, it replaces the whole word इदम्, and not only its last letter म्.\n\nOf course, it must be understood that the phrase 'consisting of more than one letter' applies to the actual substitute, and not to the substitute with its indicatory letters, the latter being for the purposes of counting regarded as mere surplusages and not to be taken into account. To see whether an affix is अनेकाल् or not, the indicatory letters must not be counted; and the affix must be stripped of all its इत् letters.",
    "11056": "This is an explanatory _sutra_, or this may be considered also as an _atidesa_ _sutra_, in as much as it declares that the operations to be performed on or by the original, may be similarly performed on or by the substitute, but with certain restrictions. The words of this _sutra_ require some detailed exposition. _Sthani_ is the word or the portion of a word which is replaced. _Adesa_ is the expression which replaces something. _Al_-_vidhi_ is a compound of '_al_' meaning alphabet, or letters in general, and '_vidhi_' rule i. e. any rule applicable to letters.\n\nThere is an exception, however, to this rule in the case of rules, the occasion for the operation of which, is furnished by the letters of the original term. That is to say for the purposes of orthographic rules, an _adesa_ is not like the _sthani_. A rule which is applicable to the letters of the _sthani_, need not be applicable to the letters of the _adesa_.\n\nThus the gerund of verbs is generally formed by adding the affix क्त्वा e. g. ग्रह् + त्वा. Now (VII. 2. 35.) prescribes the insertion of an intermediate इट् before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes beginning with any consonant except य. This rule is clearly an _al_-_vidhi_, because the occasion for its application is conditional on the letters of the affix. The affix त्वा begins with त् and is an _ardhadhatuka_ affix and fulfils all the conditions of the rule. Therefore, we have गृह् + इ + त्वा = गृहीत्वा (VI. I. 16); (VII. 2. 37).\n\nNow in compound verbs the affix त्वा is replaced by य (tech. ल्यप्). Thus संगृह् + य. This _adesa_ य which takes the place of त्वा has all the functions of त्वा viz. it has the power of making gerunds; it makes the word an indeclinable (see rule (I. 1. 41) _ante_), as the affix त्वा does. But the affix त्वा takes an intermediate इ; should, therefore, the _adesa_ य take also the इ or not? Now the augment इ which त्वा takes is by virtue of (VII. 2. 35), because it begins with a consonant of वल् _pratyahara_; while य is the only consonant which is not included in this _pratyahara_. Therefore, for the purposes of taking इ by rule (VII. 2. 35.) the _adesa_ य is not like त्वा; since that rule is one which has its scope when there are certain initial letters; or an _al_-_vidhi_. Therefore, we have संगृह्य.\n\nSubstitutes replace either a धातु 'root,' or an अङ्ग 'base,' or a _krit_ affix 'primary affix,' or a _taddhita_ affix 'secondary affix,' or an _avyaya_ 'indeclinable,' or a सुप् affix 'case affix,' or a तिङ्ग् affix 'conjugational affix,' or lastly the full word or _pada_.\n\nThe substitute of a _dhatu_ becomes like a _dhatu_. Thus _sutras_ (II. 4. 52) and (II. 4. 53) declare :- 'भू is the substitute of the root अस्, and वच् of the root ब्रू when an _ardhadhatuka_ affix follows.' Here the substitutes भू and वच् are treated as _dhatu_, and as such get the affixes तव्य &c. by (III. 1. 96), &c. Thus भविता, भवितुम्, भवितव्यम्; वक्ता, वक्तुम्, वक्तव्यम्.\n\nThe substitute of an _anga_ becomes like an _anga_. Thus (VII. 2. 103) declares:- 'क is the substitute of the base किम् when a case-affix follows.' Here, क gets the designation 'base' and so rules applicable to base, are applied to क also. Thus in केन, काभ्याम्, कैः &c., we have इन, the lengthening of the vowel, and ऐस् substituted by (VII. I. 12), and (VII. 3. 102), and (VII. 1. 9).\n\nThe substitute of a _krit_ affix becomes like a _krit_ affix. Thus (VII. I. 37) declares:- 'ल्यप् is the substitute of the _krit_ affix क्त्वा when the verb is a compound, the first member of which is an indeclinable, but not नञ्' Here, ल्यप् is also called a _krit_ affix, and as such, _sutra_ (VI. 1. 71) applies, and तुक् is added. As प्रकृ + ल्यप् = प्रकृ + त् + य = प्रकृत्य; similarly प्रहृत्य &c.\n\nThe substitute of a _taddhita_ affix is like a _taddhita_. Thus (VII. 3. 50) declares :- 'इक् is the substitute of the affix ठ' as दधि + ठक् (IV. 2. 18) = दाधिकम्, here, इक् being treated as a _taddhita_, _sutra_ (I. 2. 56) applies and the word formed by it, gets the name of _pratipadika_, and is so declined.\n\nThe substitute of an _avyaya_ is like an _avyaya_. As, प्रस्तुत्यः; प्रहृत्य. The affix क्त्वा makes _avyayas_ (I. 1. 40), its substitute ल्यप् will also make the word an _avyaya_, and as such _sutra_ (II. 4. 82) applies, and the case-affixes are elided after these words.\n\nThe substitute of _sup_-affixes becomes like _sup_. Thus (VII. 1. 13) declares:- 'य is the substitute of the _sup_-affix ङे after an inflective base ending in short अ.' Here, य is treated as a _sup_-affix, and therefore _sutra_ (VII. 3. 102) applies, and there is lengthening of the vowel, as, वृक्षाय; प्लक्षाय.\n\nThe substitute of _tin_ becomes like _tin_. Thus (III. 4. 101) declares:- 'ताम्, तम्, त and अम् are substituted for तस्, थस्, थ, and मिप् when tense-affixes having indicatory ङ follow.' Here the substitutes ताम् &c., also make the words ending in them _pada_ by rule (1. 4. 14) as, अकुरुतम्, अकुरुत &c.\n\nThe substitute of a _pada_ is like a _pada_. Thus (VIII. 1. 21) declares:- 'वस् is the substitute of युष्मान्, युष्मभ्यम्, युष्माकम्, and नस् of अस्मान्, अस्मभ्यम् and अस्माकम्.' Here, वस् and नस् are treated as _pada_, and the final स् is changed into _visarga_, as वः, नः.\n\nWhy have we used the word वत् in the _sutra_? Without it the aphorism would have been a स्थान्यादेशोऽनल्विधौ, and this being a chapter treating of definitions, the meaning would have been, 'an _adesa_ is called _sthani_.' This certainly is not intended, for had it been so, then all operations would be performed by or on the substitute, but none by the original. But this is not so. Thus rule (I. 3. 28), says 'the root हन् preceded by आ is _atmanepadi_' वध the substitute of हन् will be _atmanepadi_, as आवधिष्ट; but हन् also will be so in its proper sphere, as, आहत.\n\nThe word _adesa_ is used in the _sutra_ to indicate, that the rule applies even to partial substitutions : as changing the इ of ति into उ (III. 4. 86) in the Imperative e.g. पचतु.\n\nThe word _al_-_vidhi_ is used in order to indicate that the substitutes of दित्, पथिन्, त्यद् &c., such as the change of व् into औ (VII. 1. 84), न् into आ (VII. 1. 85), द् into अ (VII. 2. 102), are not to be treated like the original: as द्यौः, पन्थाः, सः Had these substitutes been treated like the original, rule (VI. 1. 68) would apply, and the case-affix सु would have been elided.",
    "11057": "This _sutra_ consists of three words:- अचः genitive of the _pratyahara_ अच् meaning 'of a vowel,' and means an _adesa_ which takes the place of a vowel. The words _adesa_ and _sthanivat_ are understood and are to be supplied from the preceding _sutra _. The second word is '_parasmin_' loc. sing. of '_para_' meaning 'in the subsequent.' The locative has the force of 'on account of or by reason of.' The third word is _purva_-_vidhau_ loc. sing. of _purva_-_vidhi_ meaning 'a rule applicable to a preceding thing.' The whole _sutra _ thus comes to mean that an _adesa_ which replaces a vowel, becomes _sthanivat_ (like vowel), provided that the substitution has been occasioned on account of something following and when a rule is to be applied to anything preceding such an _adesa_.\n\nThus there is an affix called णिच् the actual affix being इ; the other letters ण् and च् being इत्. The peculiarity of every affix having an indicatory ण् is to cause the _vriddhi_ of the penultimate अ; (_sutra _ (VII. 2. 116)) as पच + इ = पाचि. Now in forming the denominative verb from the word पटु, we have to add the affix णिच्. Thus पटु + इ ; but before _nich_, the उ of पटु is substituted by a '_lopa_' or blank, and this blank takes the place of the vowel उ of पटु and becomes _sthanivat_ by force of the present _sutra _. The result of becoming _sthanivat_ is that though the अ of पटु is really a penultimate and ought to be _vriddhied_ before '_nich_' it is not so, the _lopa_-substitute not allowing the अ to be regarded as penultimate, and thus we have the form पटि the present tense third person singular of which is पटयति. The equation being पट् + ० + इ, the zero preventing the अ of पट् from becoming penultimate. So also in the word अवधीत्, the aorist (लुङ्) of वध. Thus अ + वध + ईत्  = अ + वध् +० + ईत्. Here, the अ of वध is elided by (VI. 4. 48). (when an _ardhadhatuka_ affix follows there is elision of the short अ of that which ends in short अ;) this elision is thus caused by something which follows (_parasmin_.) Now there is a rule (VII. 2. 7.) which declares '_vriddhi_ is optionally the substitute of a _laghu_ अ preceded by a consonant when सिच् (aorist) follows.' However in the present case the zero is considered as _sthanivat_, and prevents the application of _sutra _ (VII. 2. 7); otherwise we get the form अवाधीत् which is inadmissible.\n\nSimilarly बहुखट्वा + कप् = बहुखट्वकः । Here, the short अ is the substitute of the longआ of खट्वा by (VII. 4. 15); because of the subsequent (_parasmin_) affix ‘_kap_'. However, the word बहुखट्व will not be considered as a word ending in a short vowel, for the purposes of the application of rule (VI. 2. 174), (the _udatta_ accent falls on the last vowel but one of a word that ends in a short vowel and is the last member of a _bahuvrihi_ compound followed by the affix _kap_). On the contrary the short अ is regarded as _sthanivat_ to long आ. Thus बहुख॑ट्वकः.\n\nIt is needless to say that this rule applies only to vowel _adesa_, therefore, where an _adesa_ replaces a consonant, the previous _sutra _ (I. 1. 56) has its scope and prevents its being _sthanivat_. Thus there is a _krit_ affix called ल्यप्, the real suffix being य, the ल् and प् being diacritical letters. Before this य the verb आगम्(to come) loses it म्, and _lopa_ or blank takes the place of म्. Here then _lopa_ or blank is an _adesa_ and म् a consonant is _sthani_.\n\nNow there is a rule which says (VI. 1. 71), that before _krit_ affixes having an indicatory प्, the letter त is added after verbs ending in light vowels. Now in आगम्, when म् is omitted, the अ of ग becomes final; and therefore a त् is required before य (which is a पित्त् affix). Thus we have आगत्य.\n\nBut had _lopa_ or blank become _sthanivat_ to म् then the अ of ग would have remained penultimate as it was when it was आगम्; and no त् would have been required. But it is not so.\n\nSimilarly in forming the word प्रश्नः. Thus प्रच्छ् + नङ् (III. 3. 90) प्रश् + नङ् (VI. 4. 19). Here, श् is substituted for छ्; this will not be _sthanivat_ to छ्; though this substitute is caused by something that follows (_parasmin_). Were it to be _sthanivat_, there would come the augment तुक् (त्) by (VI. 1. 73).\n\nSimilarly अक्राष्टाम्, the aorist of कृष्. Thus अ + कृष् + सिच् + ताम् = अ + कृष् + ० + ताम् (VIII. 2. 26). Here the स् is elided on account of what follows, but still the _lopa_ substitute here is not _sthanivat_ for the purposes of (VIII. 2. 41). Had it been _sthanivat_, ष् of कृष् would be changed into क्.\n\nMoreover this rule applies where a vowel is changed on account of something which follows (_parasmin_). Therefore, where the change has not been occasioned by anything subsequent, the _adesa_ (though of a vowel) is not _sthanivat_. Thus the words युवजानिः and बधुटीजानिः.\n\nThe word युवजानिः is a _bahuvrihi_ compound of युवति and जाया, meaning 'he who has a young wife.' In forming this compound, the आ of या is replaced by नि (tech. निङ्) by _sutra_ (V. 4. 134). This नि will not be _sthanivat_ to आ, as it is not caused by anything which follows. Had it been regarded as _sthanivat_, the य् could not be elided by (VI. 1. 66) ('there is elision of व and य when any consonant except ह् or य् follows'). Thus, युवजाया + नि = युवजाय् + ० + नि (V. 4. 134) = युवजानिः (VI. 1. 66).\n\nSimilarly the word वैयाघ्रपद्यः, 'a descendant of व्याघ्रपात्' also illustrates this rule. व्याघ्रपाद् is a _bahuvrihi_ compound of व्याघ्र and पाद, meaning 'whose foot is like that of a tiger.' Now the final अ of '_pada_' is elided in such compounds by (V. 4. 138). This _lopa_ substitution is not caused by anything that follows, therefore, this _lopadesa_ will not be _sthanivat_ for the purposes of the application of _sutra _ (VI. 4. 130) ('पत् is the substitute of the word पात् when part of an inflective base ending in the word पाद् and entitled to the name of _Bha_. I. 4. 18'). Therefore, व्याघ्रपाद् + यञ् (IV. 1. 105) = वैयाघ्रपद्यः. Had the _lopa_ been like the original, there could not have been the substitution of '_pad_' for '_pad_.'\n\nSimilarly the word आदीध्ये, Ist per. sing. _atm_. present tense of the root दीधी 'to shine.' Thus आदीधी + इट् = आदीधी + ए (III. 4. 79). This change of इ into ए is not caused by anything that follows, hence ए is not _sthanivat_ to इ, for the purposes of the application of rule (VII. 4. 53) ('the finals of _didhi_ and _vevi_ are elided when an affix beginning with य or इ follows'). Had ए been _sthanivat_, the final ई would have been elided.\n\nSimilarly an _adesa_ though of a vowel, and even though occasioned by a subsequent something, would not be _sthanivat_, if there is not the application of a rule to something that precedes the _adesa_ (_purva_-_vidhi_). If the rule is to be applied to something subsequent to the _adesa_; it will be applied to the exact _adesa_ without considering what was the letter which the _adesa_ had replaced. It is only when a rule is to be applied to a prior object, that it becomes important to consider whether the _adesa_ is _sthanivat_ or not. Thus the vocative case of गो is हे गौः । The vocative is formed from the nominative case (II. 3. 49). The nominative of गो is formed by changing ओ into औ and adding the case termination स्. Here the _adesa_ औ, replaces ओ, on account of the subsequent termination स्. Now there is a rule applicable to vocative cases which declares that the final स् is dropped after short vowels ए and ओ (VI. 1. 69).\n\nNow is the औ of गौ to be regarded as _sthanivat_ to ओ, which it replaces; for the purposes of this rule of elision of finals? If so, the consequence would be that the final स् would have to be dropped in the vocative. But it is not so. Because the rule (VI. 1. 69), which ordains the dropping of स् after short vowels and ए and ओ applies to a letter, which is not anterior to the _adesa_ औ, but to one which follows it, and consequently there being no _purva_-_vidhi_ here, the final स् is retained and we have the vocative गौः ।\n\nSimilarly the word बाभ्रवीयाः, 'the pupils of _Babhravya_.' The word बाभ्रव्य is derived from बभ्रु in this wise. बभ्रु + यञ् (IV. I. I05) = बाभ्रो + यञ् (VI. 4. 146) and (VII. 2. 117) = बाभ्रव् + यञ् (VI. 1. 79) = बाभ्रव्यः. From this is formed बाभ्रवीय in this wise :- बाभ्रव्य + छ् (IV. 2. 114) = बाभ्रव्य + ईय (VII. 1. 2) = बाभ्रव्य् + ईय (VI. 4. 148) = बाभ्रव् + ईय (VI. 4. 150). Here, had the substitute अव् which replaced the ओ of बाभ्रो, been _sthanivat_ to ओ, rule (VI. 4. 150) ('there is elision of the य of a _taddhita_ affix coming after a consonant, when long ई follows'), could not have applied. But this substitute अव् is not _sthanivat_ for the purposes of rule (VI. 4. 150), in as much as that rule does not apply to any letter that precedes the substitute अव्, but to the very letters of the substitute itself.\n\nSimilarly the word नैधेयः, which is evolved from the root धा, in this wise नि + धा + कि (III. 3. 92) = नि + धा + इ (1. 3. 8)= नि + ध् + ० + इ (VI. 4. 64) = निधि. Let us then form a secondary derivative from the word निधि applying ढक् (IV. 1. 122), the whole of which affix is replaced by एय (VII. 1. 2). Thus निधि + एय = निध् + एय(VI. 4. 148) = नैधेय (VII. 2. 118). Here, the _lopa_ substituted for the आ of धा by (VI. 4. 64) is not _sthanivat_ for the purposes of the application of (IV. I. 122) by which the affix ढक् is added. Rule (V. 1. 122) says, '_dhak_ is added to a word ending in इ, provided it be a word containing two vowels.' Now निधि ends in इ and contains two vowels; but if the _lopa_ were _sthanivat_ to the elided आ, then it would be a word of three syllables. That is however not so; because the rule enjoining the affix ढक्  is not applicable to anything preceding the _lopadesa_, but is enjoined with regard to something after this substitution.",
    "11058": "This _sutra_ lays down an exception to the previous _sutra_, by which it was ruled that an _adesa_ which replaced a vowel becomes _sthanivat_ under certain conditions. This _sutra_ says that a vowel _adesa_ is not _sthanivat_ under the following circumtances.\n\n1. पदान्तविधिः-- 'A rule relating to the last letter of a word.' Thus the अ of अस् is elided before the terminations of dual and plural numbers (VI. 4. III). Thus we have अस्ति 'he is,' स्तः 'they two are,' सन्ति 'they are.' Now in the technical phraseology of Sanskrit grammarians, the अ of स्तः and सन्ति is replaced by an _adesa_ called लोप्, the peculiarity of which is that the whole of it vanishes. So that before the word स्तः there is this _adesa_ existing, though it is in an invisible form. This invisible _adesa_ will be _sthanivat_, as it replaces a vowel, by reason of something that follows, i. e. the affixes तः and अन्ति being ङित् (I. 2. 4); and it will have all the powers of अ by the last _sutra_, in the absence of any rule to the contrary. Therefore, in the sentence कौ स्तः 'who two are' the final औ of कौ and the invisible अ of स्तः ought to coalesce by rules of _sandhi_ into आव (VI. 1. 78). But this incongruity is prevented by the present _sutra_, by which the change of औ into आव् is a पदान्त विधि or a rule relating to the finals of a word, therefore, we have कौ स्तः । So also in तानि सन्ति, rule (VI. 1. 77) is not applied.\n\n2. द्विर्वचनविधिः 'a rule relating to the doubling of letters.' In the _sandhi_ of दधि + अत्र we have दध्यत्र. Here इ is changed into य्. If this य् were _sthanivat_ to इ, then the rule by which ध् could be doubled before य् would be inapplicable. But य् is not equivalent to इ, though its substitute; and we have the doubling of ध् and get the form दद्ध्यत्र. Therefore, in rules relating to the doubling of letters the _adesa_ is not equivalent to the _sthani_.\n\n3. वरेविधिः 'a rule relating to the affix वरच्.' The affix वरच् is a _krit_ affix which is added to certain roots to form nouns of agency; thus from ईश् 'to rule' we have ईश्वरः 'ruler.' So from the intensive verb यायाय we have यायावरः 'a vagrant.' It is formed in this wise यायाय + वर (III. 2. 176) = यायाय् + ० + वर (VI. 4. 48). Here the अ of य has been dropped and replaced by _lopa_, on account of its being followed by the _ardhadhatuka_ affix वरच्. The next step is to drop the य् by rule (VI. 1. 66) which declares that the letters व् and य् are dropped before affixes beginning with any consonant except i. e., beginning with consonants of वल् _pratyahara_. Thus याया + ० + वर. Now there is a rule (VI. 4. 64) which declares that the final long आ of a base is dropped before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes having an initial vowel. Here therefore, if the _adesa_ '_lopa_,' which replaced the vowel अ, be considered as _sthanivat_, and be considered as an affix having a latent initial vowel, then the आ of याया requires to be dropped. But this _sutra_ prevents this and we have the form यायावर; as, अप्सु यायावरः प्रवपेत पिण्डान् ॥\n\n4. यलोपविधिः 'a rule relating to the dropping of _ya_.' Thus there is a verb कण्डूय 'to scratch'. In forming an abstract noun from it, the affix ति (tech. क्तिच्) is added. Thus कण्डूय + ति = कण्डूय् + ० + ति, the अ of य being dropped by (VI. 4. 48). Now there is a rule (VI. 1. 66) already mentioned above which requires the elision of य् before consonantal affixes. Now if the _lopa_ substitute be considered as _sthanivat_ to अ, then the affix ति is not an affix having an initial consonant and the rule, which requires the dropping of य्, would not apply. The present _sutra_, however, provides for this, and we have the form कण्डूतिः 'scratching.'\n\n5. स्वरविधिः 'a rule relating to accent.' There is a _sutra_ (VI. 1. 193) which says that when a word is formed by an affix that has an indicatory ल्, the vowel that immediately precedes such an affix has the _udatta_ accent. Now ण्वुल् is an affix that has an indicatory ल्, the real affix bein अक (VII. I. I.). It is an affix used in forming nouns of agency. Adding this affix to the desiderative verb चिकीर्ष 'desirous of doing' we have:-- चिकीर्ष + अक = चिकीर्ष् + ० + अक, the अ being dropped by (VI. 4. 48). Now if the zero be considered as _sthanivat_, then the accent must fall on this latent अ but it is not so. The accent falls on the ई of की; and we have चि॒॒कीर्ष॑कः, so also जि॒॒हीर्ष॑कः ॥\n\n6. सवर्णविधिः 'a rule relating to the substitution of homogeneous letters.' To explain this, let us form the second person singular of the verb शिष् in the imperative mood. The affix हि is the sign of the second person imperative singular; and the verb शिष् belongs to the seventh-class of verbs called _Rudhadi_. This class of verbs take the _vikarana_ श्नम् (III. 1. 78) the श् and म् being indicatory the real affix is न. This न is inserted between the radical vowel and the final consonant (I. 1. 47). Therefore we have the following equation:- शिष् + श्नम् + हि = शि + न + ष् + हि = शि + न् + ० + ष् + हि. The अ of न is dropped by (VI. 4. III), which declares that the अ of श्नम् is dropped before those _sarvadhatuka_ terminations which are कित् or ङित्. By (I. 2. 4) all _sarvadhatuka_ terminations which have not got an indicatory प् are considered as ङित्. The affix हि therefore is a ङित् _sarvadhatuka_ affix, and by rule (III. 4. 87), हि is to be regarded as अपित्, not having an indicatory प्. The next stage is :-- शि + न् + ० + ष् + धि; the हि being changed into धि by rule (VI. 4. 101) which says that 'हि is changed into धि, when it follows a root which ends in a consonant of झल् _pratyahara_:' here ष् and ध् are changed by general rules of _sandhi_ into ड् and ढ् and we have शि + न् + ० + ड् + ढि (VIII. 4. 41). Then there is a rule (VIII. 3. 24), which says that in the body of a word the 'न् is changed into _anusvara_ when followed by a consonant of झल् _pratyahara_.' Therefore we have :-- शि + ० + ० + ड् + ढि. This is the form to which the present rule is applicable. Thus, there is a rule (VIII. 4. 58) which says that an _anusvara_ followed by a letter of यय् _pratyahara_ i.e., any consonant except ह्, श् ष् and स् is changed into a letter homogeneous or _savarna_ to the letter that follows. Therefore, if we regard zero as _sthanivat_ to the अ which it replaces, the _anusvara_ cannot be changed into ण् as homogeneous to ङ्. But it is not to be so regarded, and we have the form शि + ण् + ड् + ढि = शिण्ड्ढि or शिण्ढि; so also पिण्ढि.\n\n7. अनुस्वारविधिः 'a rule relating to _anusvara_.' The above example will serve the purpose here:-- शि + न् + ० + ड् + ढि. This by the rule already mentioned (VIII. 3. 24), requires the न् to be changed into _anusvara_. Now if zero be considered as _sthanivat_, then न् is not followed by a letter of झल् _pratyahara_ , and cannot be changed into _anusvara_. However, the zero is not regarded as _sthanivat_, and we change the न् into _anusvara_. Other examples are शि + न् + ० + ष् + अन्ति = शिंषन्ति; so also पिंषन्ति ॥  \n\n8. दीर्घविधिः 'a rule directing the substitution of long vowels for short vowels.' Let us form the Inst. sing. of the noun प्रतिदिवन्. The termination of the Inst. sing. is टा or आ. Therefore, we have प्रतिदिवन् + आ = प्रतिदिव् + ० + न् + आ. Here the अ has been elided by rule (VI. 4. 134), which teaches that words ending in अन् lose their अ before terminations technically called _Bha_. The termination of Inst. sing. is a _Bha_ termination by force of rule (I. 4. 18). The next rule that now comes into operation, is (VIII. 2. 77), which requires the lengthening of the short penultimate vowels, of the इक् _pratyahara_, of words that end in र् or व् and are followed by a consonant. Here दिव् is a root that ends in व्; and if the zero be considered as _sthanivat_, then this व् is not followed by a consonant, but by a latent vowel, and so the short इ of दिव् will not be lengthened. This rule, however, provides for such lengthening, and therefore we have :- प्रतिदिव् + ० + न् + आ = प्रतिदीव्ना ॥\n\n9. जश्विधिः 'a rule requiring the substitution of soft unaspirate consonants, of _pratyahara_ जश्, in the place of hard consonants' In this case also the _adesa_ that takes the place of a vowel is not _sthanivat_.\n\nLet us add the affix क्तिन् to the root अद् 'to eat,' compounded with the word स or समान. In Vedic literature अद् is replaced by घस्, (II. 4. 39); so we have, स + घस् + क्तिन् = स + घस् + ति = स + घ् + ० + स् + ति (VI. 4. 100) = स + घ् + ० + ० + ति (VIII. 2. 26) = स + घ् + ० + ० + धि (VIII. 2. 40).\n\nIt is at this stage, that rule (VIII. 4. 53) requires the घ् to be changed into ग्. This is a जश् rule, and teaches that in the place of letters of झल् class, the letters of जश् class are substituted, if followed by letters of झश् class. If the zero which was obtained by dropping the अ of घ, be considered as _sthanivat_, then the घ् is not followed by a consonant of झश् class, and cannot be changed into ग्. But it is not so. Therefore सघ् + ० + ० + धि = सग्धिः (_Yaj_. _Ved_. XVIII. 9). The various rules, by which first अ is omitted, and then स् is dropped, have been referred to in brackets, and will be explained in their proper places.\n\nSimilarly the word बब्धाम्, which is the Imperative (_lot_) 2nd per. dual of the root भस्, and is thus evolved. This root belongs to the _Juhutyadi_ class, and therefore, there is reduplication. Thus भस् + ताम् = भस् + भस् + ताम् = भ + भस् + ताम् = ब + भस् + ताम् = ब + भ् + ० + स् + ताम् (VI. 4. 100) = ब + भ्+ ० + ० + ताम् (VIII. 2. 26) = ब + भ् + ० + ० + धाम् (VIII. 2. 40) = ब + ब् + ० + ० + धाम् = बब्धाम् ॥ Here the change of भ् into ब् is by the application of (VIII. 4. 53), which is a _jas_ rule, and therefore, the zero is not _sthanivat_.\n\n10. चर्विधिः 'a rule requiring the substitution of the letters of चर् _pratyahara_ instead of other consonants.' In the application of this rule, also the substitute that replaces a vowel is not _sthanivat_.\n\nLet us form the 2nd pers. sing. perfect of the verb अद् 'to eat.' अद् is replaced by घस् (II. 4. 40) and अतुस् is the termination of the second person singular of _lit_ or perfect tense.  घस् + अतुस् = घस् + घस् + अतुस् (VI. 1. 8) = घ + घस् + अतुस् (VII. 4. 60) = ज + घस् + अतुस् (VIII. 4. 54) = ज + घ् + ० + स् + अतुस् (VI. 4. 98) = जघ् + ० + सतुस्.\n\nAt this stage comes the चर् rule in operation, which says that the letters of झल्  _pratyahara_ are replaced by those of चर् _pratyahara_, when followed by letters of खर् _pratyahara_. Here घ् is a letter of झल् class, and if zero is not _sthanivat_, it is followed by स् which is a letter of खर् class, and therefore घ् is required to be changed into क् of चर् class. By the present rule, zero is not _sthanivat_ and thus we have :- जक् + सतुस् = जक्षतुः (VIII. 3. 60).\n\nSimilarly अक्षन् the 3rd per. plural aorist of घस् is thus formed:- अ + घस् + च्लि + अन् = अ + घस् + अन् (II. 4. 80) = अ + घ् + ० + स् + अन् (VI. 4. 98). Here had the _lopa_ been _sthanivat_, rule (VIII. 4. 55) could not have applied. But it being a _char_ rule, the _lopa_ is not _sthanivat_. Therefore we have, अक्षन्.\n\nWhen _lopa_ is the substitute of a vowel, it is not _sthanivat_, for the purposes of the application of the rules of accent, rules relating to the doubling of letters, and the rules relating to the elision of _ya_. In other places, with the exception of the above three; the _lopa_ substitute of a vowel is, and must be treated as _sthanivat_. Thus बहुखट्वकः, किर्योः, गिर्योः, वाय्वोः. In these cases the _lopa_-_adesa_ being _sthanivat_, the rules relating to accent, lengthening and the elision of _ya_, do not apply.",
    "11059": "This _sutra_ has been explained in different ways by the authors of the _Kasika_ and of the _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_. According to the latter, the _sutra_ means:-- 'when an affix beginning with a vowel follows, that is a cause of reduplication, a substitute shall not take the place of a preceding vowel, whilst the reduplication is yet to be made : but the reduplication having been made, the substitution may then take place.' The explanation given by _Kasika_ is more in harmony with the Great Commentary. For all practical purposes, the two explanations lead to the same conclusion. According to _Kasika_, the vowel-substitute is _sthanivat_, in the sense, that it is exactly of the same form as the original, and retains this form only for a fixed time viz., so long as the reduplication is being made; but as soon as the reduplication has been made, the substitute takes its proper form. This rule has its scope in the rules relating (a) to the elision of long आ, (b) to the elision of the penultimate, (c) to the elision of the affix णिच्, (d) to the substitution of semi-vowels for vowels, and lastly (e) to the substitution of अय्, अव्, आय् and आव् for ए, ओ ऐ and औ respectively by the rules of _sandhi_.\n\n(a). Elision of आ. Let us form the 2nd person perfect tense of the root पा 'to drink.' The termination of 2nd person perfect is अतुस्. This is, therefore, a termination beginning with a vowel, and it causes the reduplication of the root. The conditions of the present _sutra_ all exist in this. Thus we have पा + अतुस् = प् + ० + अतुस् (VI. 4. 64). Here the आ is elided by (VI. 4. 64.) which teaches that 'the आ of the root is elided before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes beginning with a vowel and which are कित् or ङित् and before इट्.' The affix अतुस् is such an affix (I. 2. 5), (III. 4. 115).\n\nNow comes the rule about reduplication which is contained in _sutra_ (VI. 1. 8), and teaches that a root consisting of a single vowel is reduplicated before the terminations of the perfect. Here, by the elision of आ, the only visible root left to us is प् which is a consonant without any vowel. The rule of reduplication, therefore, would not have applied to it, because there is no vowel in it, but for the present _sutra_, which solves the difficulty. Here the vowel-substitute zero must be considered _sthanivat_ i. e. as if it were the very आ itself. Thus we have पा + प् + ० + अतुस् = पपतुस् (VII. 4. 59). The long आ of the reduplicative syllable has been shortened by (VII. 4. 59). So also पपुः ।\n\n(b). The elision of the penultimate. Let us form the same tense of हन् 'to kill.' हन् + अतुस् = ह् + ० + न् + अतुस् (VI. 4. 98).\n\nHere also the preliminary conditions are all fulfilled, the affix begins with a vowel and it causes the reduplication of the root. The penultimate अ of हन् is replaced by the substitute _lopa_ by (VI. 4. 98), which teaches that the roots गम् 'to go' हन् 'to kill' and a few others lose their penultimate before affixes beginning with a vowel and which are also कित् or ङित्. We know अतुस् to be such an affix. For the reasons already given, we can not reduplicate the consonants हन् as they have no vowel. However, this reduplication is effected by virtue of the present rule, and we have:- ह + हृ + अतुस् = जघ्नतुः (VII. 4. 62), (VII. 3. 55). The first ह् is changed into ज् by (VII. 4. 62) and the second ह् into घ् by (VII. 3. 55).\n\nThe elision of the affix णिच् . Let us form the Aorist (_lun_) of the causative form of अट्. The causative is formed by adding the affix णिच् to the root; and the aorist takes the augment अ. Thus we have :- अ + अट् + णिच् + त् = आट् + इ + त्= आट् + इ + चङ् + त्. The affix चङ् (III. 1. 48) is added in forming the aorist of causatives. The letters च् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix being अ. Now by (VI. 4. 51), the affix णिच् is elided before an _ardhadhatuka_ affix that does not take the intermediate इ. Now चङ् is such an affix. Therefore we have आट् + ० + अत् .\n\nAt this stage, comes into operation another rule (VI. 1. 11), which declares that 'the root is reduplicated before the affix चङ्.' The चङ् is, thus, an affix which causes reduplication; it is an affix which also begins with a vowel. Therefore, it satisfies the conditions of this _sutra_. Therefore, the zero which was a substitute in place of the vowel इ, becomes _sthanivat_ to इ; as if it were the very इ itself. Thus we have the reduplicative syllable टि, by rule (VI. 1. 2), which says that a verb beginning with a vowel reduplicates its second syllable. But as soon as the reduplication is over, the _adesa_ takes up its original form of zero. Thus आटिट् + ० + अत् = आटिटत्.\n\n(d). The fourth class of cases, where this _sutra_ has scope, is the substitution of यण् for vowels. Thus let us form the perfect and 2nd person singular of कृ 'to do' :- कृ + अतुस् = क्र् + अतुस्, the semi-vowel र् taking the place of ॠ by the general rule of _sandhi_ (VI. 1.77). Now we have already learned that अतुस् is an affix which causes reduplication and it begins with a vowel. Now र् is a substitute which comes in the place of a vowel (i.e., ॠ), it will therefore be _sthanivat_ by this _sutra_. Had it not been _sthanivat_, the consonants क्र् could not be reduplicated, as they have no vowel. The substitute र् being taken equal to ॠ, we reduplicate कृ; in reduplication the क is changed into च् by (VII. 4. 62), and ॠ into अ by (VII. 4. 66). Thus we have:- चक्रतुः; similarly चक्रुः ।\n\n(e). The fifth case is the substitution of अय् &c. Let us form Ist person singular of the perfect of नी 'to lead:' नी + णल् = नै + अ = नाय् + अ. The ई is _vriddhied_ before the termination अ of the perfect (VII. 2. 115), and then changed into आय् by the general rule of _sandhi_ (VI. 1. 78). Now the अ of the perfect causes reduplication, and it is an affix which begins with a vowel. It satisfies the conditions of this _sutra_. Therefore the आय् which was a substitute for ऐ, being a vowel substitute, becomes _sthanivat_ to ऐ in form. In reduplicating the word नाय्, we reduplicate as if it were still नै. Thus we have the form निनाय and not ननाय. Similarly निनय, लुलव, and लुलाव.\n\nWhy have we used the word \"_dvirvachane_\" in the _sutra_? Without it, the aphorism would have stood thus:-\"Before an affix having an initial vowel which causes reduplication, the substitute which takes the place of a vowel is like the original vowel.\" Let us form जग्ले the 3rd per. sing, perfect tense (लिट्) of the root ग्लै \"to be exhausted,\" in the _atmanepada_. The affix of 3rd per. sing. _atm_. of _lit_, is एश् (III. 4, 81). Thus ग्लै + एश् = ग्ला + एश् (VI. 1. 45). Now here ऐ is changed into आ, on account of the affix एश्; this affix causes reduplication, but still आ is not to be considered as _sthanivat_ to ऐ. For if आ be considered so, then in the next stage ग्ला + एश् = ग्ला + ० + एश् (VI. 4. 64) the _lopa_ will be regarded as _sthanivat_ to ऐ and the reduplicative syllable will be जि and not ज; the form being जिग्ले and not जग्ले. But  आ is not _sthanivat_ to ऐ, because for the purposes of reduplication, the change of ऐ into आ is immaterial; it is the second and further change of आ into zero which is directly connected with reduplication, (for if zero be not considered _sthanivat_, there can be no reduplication); and therefore, this substitute zero should be regarded as _sthanivat_ to आ.\n\nWhy do we say \"which causes reduplication?\" Without these words the _sutra_ would have stood thus:- \"Before an affix having an initial vowel, the substitute which takes the place of a vowel is like the original vowel, for the purposes of reduplication.\" In that case we could not get the form दुद्यूषति, 3rd per. sing, desiderative present tense of दिव् 'to shine, to play.' This form is thus evolved :- दिव् + सन् (III. 1. 7) = दि + ऊ + सन् (VI. 4. 19) = द्य् + ऊ + सन् (VI. 1. 77). Here, the change of इ into य् is caused by ऊ (tech. ऊठ्), which begins with a vowel; is this य् to be regarded as _sthanivat_ to इ? No, because ऊ does not cause reduplication, it is सन् which causes reduplication. Therefore the equation is :- द्यू + सन् = दुद्यूस (VI. 1. 9) = दुद्यूषति. If य् could be regarded like इ, then the form would have been दिद्यूषति.\n\nWhy do we say \"beginning with a vowel\"? Otherwise the _sutra_ would have run thus:- \"Before an affix which causes reduplication, the substitute which takes the place of a vowel, is like the original vowel, for the purposes of reduplication.\" The affix यङ् of the Intensive verbs causes reduplication (VI. 1. 9); but as it does not begin with a vowel, the substitute will not be _sthanivat_. Let us form जेघीयते the 3rd per. sing. Intensive of the root घ्रा 'to smell.' Thus घ्रा + यङ् = घ्री + यङ् (VII. 4. 31) = जेघ्रीयते (VII. 4. 82). Here, आ is changed into ई on account of यङ्; but ई is not _sthanivat_ to आ; had it been so, the form would have been जघ्रीयते. Similarly देध्मीयते.",
    "11060": "This defines elision. When a letter or word-form becomes latent, is neither heard, nor pronounced, nor written, it becomes _lopa_ or is said to be elided. _Lopa_ is the term for the disappearance of anything previously apparent.\nIn Sanskrit Grammar, this \"_lopa_\" is considered as a substitute or _adesa_, and as such this grammatical zero has all the rights and liabilities of the thing which it replaces. This blank or _lopa_ is in several places treated as having a real existence and rules are made applicable to it, in the same way as to any ordinary substitute that has an apparent form. The Grammarians do not content themselves with one sort of blank, but have invented several others; there are many kinds of them, such as _lopa_ blank, _slu_ blank, _lup_ blank, and _luk_ blank, which like different sorts of zeroes of a Mathematician, have different functions.\n\nThe word _lopa_ occurs in _sutras_ (VI. 1. 66) and (VI. 4. 118) &c. The _lopa_ substitute is a sense substitute, and not a form substitute. Thus when we say 'let the substitute _lopa_ take the place of such and such a letter or word,' we do not mean that the letters ल्, ओ, प् and अ should be substituted there, but the sense of the thing, namely 'disappearance.'",
    "11061": "When an affix is elided by using the term _luk_, that disappearance gets the appellation of _luk_, similarly when an affix is elided by using the terms _slu_ or _lup_, the disappearance gets the name of _slu_ or _lup_.\n\nThus in अद् + शप्लुक् + ति = अत्ति 'he eats.' Here the _vikarana_ शप् has been elided by using the word _luk_ (II. 4. 72). Similarly in जुहोति 'he invokes,' the _vikarana_ शप् is elided by the word _slu_ (II. 4. 75), so in वरणाः 'a city in the vicinity of weeds called _varana_.' Here the _Taddhita_ affix indicating vicinity has been elided by the word _lup_. (IV. 2. 82).\n\nWhy do we use the words \"of the affix\"? Without these words, the _sutra_ would have run thus:- \"The disappearance is called _luk_, _slu_ or _lup_.\" So that the disappearance of a base would also be caused by the use of these terms. Thus in (II. 4. 70), there would have been '_luk_' of the bases _agastya_, and _kaundinya_; which however is not intended. In that _sutra_, the '_luk_' of the affixes is only intended. So also in _sutra_ (IV. 3. 168) there would have been the substitution of '_luk_' for the bases of the words.",
    "11062": "This _sutra_ declares that when an affix disappears by _lopa_-elision its potency does not disappear. Thus the term '_pada_' is defined to be that which ends in a case-affix or a conjugational-affix. But after certain bases, these affixes vanish; still those bases become '_pada_' in spite of the vanishing of the whole affix. How can an operation directed by an affix take place, when the affix itself vanishes, is a doubt which may naturally arise. This _sutra_ answers the question. Though an affix may be elided by _lopa_, yet an operation of which such an affix was the cause, must take place. Thus अग्निचित् is a _pada_ though the case-termination has been elided. Similarly the word अधोक् 'he milked;' which is the Imperfect (लङ्) of दुह्, and is thus formed. अदोह् + तिप् = अदोह् + त् (III. 4. 100) = अदोह् + ० (VI. 1. 68) = अदोघ् + ० (VIII. 2. 32) (here ह् is changed into घ् by taking the word '_aduh_' as a '_pada_') अधोघ् + ० (VIII. 2. 37) = अधोग् (VIII. 2. 39) = अधोक्.\n\nWhy have we used the word प्रत्यय in this aphorism again, when its _anuvritti_ was understood in this _sutra _ from the last ? This repetition indicates that the present rule applies where the whole of the affix is elided, and not when a portion of an affix is elided. The present _sutra_, therefore, does not apply to forms like आघ्नीय and सङ्ग्मीय. These forms are the 1st person sing. लिङ् _Atmanepada_ of हन् and गम्. Thus आहन् + इट् = आहन् + अ (III. 4. 106) = आहन् + सीयुट् + अ (III. 4. 102) = आहन् + ईय् + अ. Here, स् a portion of the affix सीयुट् is elided by (VII. 2. 79); now there will be no प्रत्ययलक्षण of this partial elision of an affix. Had it been so, the final nasal न् of आहन् would have been elided by (VI. 4. 37): but that is not so: and we have आघ्नीय (VII. 3. 54) and (VI. 4.98).\n\nThe word लक्षण means that by which a thing is recognised. The word प्रत्ययलक्षण, therefore, means the effect by which an affix could be recognised. The orthographical changes, like the following, are not however _pratyaya_-_lakshana_. In forming the genitive singular of रै 'wealth,' we have  रै + अस् = रायः, here, the change of ऐ into आय् by the rules of _sandhi_, though caused by the affix अस्; is not such an effect, which the affix causes, by virtue of being an affix, but it is an effect caused by the accidental fact, that the affix begins with a vowel, and thus gives scope to the euphonic rule (VI. 1. 78). Therefore, when in forming the genitive compound of रायः + कुलं, we elide the case-affix अस्, we get the form रैकुलम्. Here the elided affix will not cause the peculiar orthographic change mentioned above, which is dependent upon its letters, and not upon the affix as such.",
    "11063": "This _sutra_ is a special exception to the previous aphorism which was too extensive. It declares, that when an affix is elided by using the words लुक्, श्लु, or लुप्, then the 'sign' or लक्षण or the peculiar virtue of the affix also vanishes. Thus there is an important difference in the elision of an affix by force of the words लुप् &c.; and by the word लोप. In one case the virtue of the affix subsists inspite of the elision, in the other it does not.\n\nThe word अङ्ग in this _sutra_ requires some explanation. \"A root, followed by a suffix (_pratyaya_), is raised to the dignity of a base (_pratipadika_), and finally becomes a real word (_pada_) when it is finished by receiving a case-termination (_vibhakti_). Every base, with regard to the suffix which is attached to it, is called _Anga_, body.\"\n\nThus the word गर्गाः is the plural of the word गार्ग्यः. The word गार्ग्यः is formed by adding the affix यञ् to गर्ग (IV. 1. 105); the force of the indicatory ञ् being to cause the _vriddhi_ of the first vowel of the word (VII. 2. 117). But in forming the plural of गार्ग्य, rule (II. 4. 64) presents itself, which declares that there is _luk_ of the affix यञ् when the word takes the plural. Here the affix यञ् is elided by the word _luk_, which means not only the elision of the य of गार्ग्य but also the shortening of आ into अ, that is, the affix being elided, it vanishes altogether, leaving no trace behind, in the shape of the _vriddhing_ of the first vowel, which the affix was competent to cause.\n\nSimilarly सृष्टः is the 3rd per. dual present tense of सृज् 'to clean.' It belongs to _Adadi_ class in which the _vikarana_ शप् is elided by '_luk_' (II. 4. 72); and hence there is no _vriddhi_ substitution, which would have taken place by (VII. 2. 114), (the _ik_ of the base सृज् is _vriddhied_ before verbal affixes).\n\nSimilarly जुहुतः 'they two sacrifice'; here the _vikarana_ शप् has been elided by using the word '_slu_' ((II. 4. 75), let _slu_ be substituted in the room of _sap_ after the verbs _hu_&c). The effect of this elision is, that there is no _guna_ substitution of the vowel of the base, which शप् was competent to cause.\n\nWhen an affix is elided in any other way than by the enunciation of the three terms containing लु, it is competent to cause its proper effect. Thus कृ + णिच् + यक् + ते = कारि + यक् + ते = कार् + यक् + ते = कार्यते. Here the elision of the affix _nich_ is by '_lopa_,' (VI. 4. 51) and hence though the affix vanishes, its effect remains. Why do we say 'in respect of an _Anga_ or inflective base?' Observe पञ्च 'five,' सप्त 'seven,' पयः 'milk,' साम '_sama_ _veda_.' Here in the word _pancha_, the plural case-affix is elided by (VII. I. 22) (after the words called _shat_, the जस् and शस् are elided by '_luk_'). Here the affix is elided by enouncing the word '_luk_,' the result is, that the affix cannot produce any change which it would otherwise have caused, in the _anga_ or inflective base; such as lengthening, as in _rajan_, 'a king,' I. p. _rajanah_ 'kings.' But though it is inoperative as regards the _anga_, the elided affix is not altogether inactive. It retains the virtue of raising the base to the dignity of a _pada_. Thus:- पंचन् + जस् = पंचन् + ०, (_luk_ (VII. 1. 22)). The word _panchan_ is now a _pada_, and as such, it drops its final न्.",
    "11064": "This _sutra _ defines टि. It is that portion of a word which is included between the last letter and the nearest vowel. Thus in the word अग्निचित् the portion इत् is टि; so also in सामसुत् the portion उत्. The word टि occurs in _sutra _ (III. 4. 79).\n\nThe word अचः in the _sutra_ is in the genitive case, which has the force of _nirdharana_ or specification; and though it is in the singular number, it represents class name, meaning 'among the vowels.'",
    "11065": "This defines उपधा or penultimate. Thus in the words पच्, भिद्, बुध्, वृत् the letters अ, इ, उ, and ऋ are उपधा.\n\nThe word '_upadha_' occurs in _sutra_ (VII. 2. 116).",
    "11066": "This is a declaratory or interpreting _sutra_. When in a _sutra_, a word is used in the locative case, the operation ordained by that _sutra_ is to be performed on the word preceding it. Thus in the _sutra_ इको यणचि (VI. 1.77) the word अचि is in the locative case, which _sutra_, therefore, means that इ, उ, ऋ लृ followed by a vowel (अच्) are changed into य्, व्, र्, ल्, (यण्). The literal translation of the _sutra_ being:- 'Of इक् there is यण् in अच्.' The force of 'in' or the locative case being to induce changes in the letter preceding the vowel. Thus दधि + उदकम् = दध्युदकम्; So मध्विदम्, पचत्योदनम् ॥\n\nThe word _nirdishta_ (meaning 'exhibited') has been used in the _sutra_ to indicate immediateness. Thus in अग्निचित्, the इ of अग्नि the is not directly followed by the इ of चित्, there being the letter च् intervening, therefore, rule (VI. 1. 77), does not apply here : and we have no _sandhi_.",
    "11067": "This _sutra_ explains the force of words in the ablative case when employed in these aphorisms. As the locative case refers to a preceding word, so the ablative refers to a succeeding word.\n\nThus _sutra_ (VIII. 4. 61) declares that 'after उद्, of _stha_ and _stambha_, the substitute is a letter belonging to the class of the prior.' Thus उद् + स्थानम्. Here the word उदः is exhibited in the original _sutra_ in the ablative case, and by the present _sutra_ it means that a dental letter थ् must be substituted in the place of _sthana_, and by (I. 1. 54) _ante_, this dental takes the place of स्; we have उद् + थ्थानम् = उत्थ्-थानम्. Similarly in _sutra_ तिङ् ङतिङः(VIII. 2. 18), 'a word ending in a conjugational affix, when following after a word ending in a non-conjugational affix, becomes _anudatta_.') Here the word '_atinah_' is exhibited in the ablative case, therefore, the operation directed by this aphorism, namely, the substitution of _anudatta_ accent, must take place in the word that follows. Thus ओदनं पचति; but not so in पचत्योदनमिति ॥",
    "11068": "This is a rule of interpretation. The word स्वं which means 'one's own' denotes 'the meaning,' and the word रूप denotes 'the individual form of a word.' The sense of the _sutra_ is that a word denotes both things expressed by those two words स्वं and रूप, viz., its meaning, and its form. Thus a rule applicable to अग्नि will be applicable to the word composed of अ, ग्, न्, इ and not to the words synonymous with _agni_, such as, पाककः, ज्वलनः &c.\n\nIn this science, therefore, the very word-form is to be taken, and understood and operated upon, and not external sense: with the exception of words which are definitions, in the latter case the things defined are to be taken.\n\nThis _sutra_ is begun in order to remove the difficulty which might otherwise arise from a consideration that a word connotes a certain meaning, and as no grammatical operation is possible in a concrete object, we must take the words having the same meaning. As when a person is called to bring a 'cow,' he brings the animal cow, and not the letters c, o, w. It may therefore be said, that as no grammatical operation is possible in a material thing, we may take all the names synonymous with the word and operate upon them; this _sutra_ removes that doubt.\n\nThus the _sutra_ अग्नेर्ढक् (IV. 2. 33) declares:- \"that the affix '_dhak_' comes after the word '_agni_'.\" Thus अग्नि + ढक् = आग्नेयम् \"belonging to _agni_,\" as in the following sentence आग्नेयमष्टाकपालं निर्वपेत्. Here the word अग्नि indicates the individual word-form अग्नि and not its synonyms. Similarly _sutra_ (IV. 2. 19) declares :- 'let there be optionally ठक् after उदश्वित्.' As औदश्वित्कम् (VII. 3. 50) and (VII. 3. 51) or औदश्वितम्. The rule applies to the word-form '_udasvita_' meaning 'curd-milk' and not to तक्र, अरिष्ट, कालशेप, दण्डाहत and मथित, which are synonyms.\n\nThere is an important exception to this rule, and that is in favour of terms which are technical terms of Grammar and have been so defined.\n\nThus दाधाघ्वदाप् (1. 1. 20) and तरप्तमपौ घः (I. 1. 22). Here the words 'घु' and 'घ' denote the words connoted by those terms and not to their word-form. There are, however, some _sutras_ in _Panini_ which are apparently exceptions to this rule. These exceptions have been arranged under four heads, technically called सित्, पित्, जित्, and झित्. When there is a rule about a word, it may mean that very word-form, or words representing species falling under that word, or words which are synonymous with it. Thus rule (II. 4. 12) declares, :- \"वृक्ष 'tree' मृग 'deer,' तृण 'grass,' &c., may optionally be compounded as _dvandva_.\" Here the word वृक्ष stands as a generic name for the species falling under it, and does not represent the word-form, वृक्ष. Thus we have _dvandva_-compound of प्लक्ष + न्यग्रोध, as प्लक्षन्यग्रोधम् or प्लक्षन्यग्रोधाः । Such _sutras_ are called सित्.\n\nThen in _sutra _ (III. 4. 40), we have an example of पित्. That _sutra_ means \"the word पुष 'to feed' takes the affix णमुल (अम्) when compounded with the word स्व.\" Here the word 'स्व' means both the word-form स्व, as well as the synonyms of स्व and the species of स्व. Thus स्व and धन 'wealth' are synonyms; while स्व 'wealth' and गो 'cow' are genus and species. Thus स्व + पुष् + णमुल् = स्वपोषम्. Similarly रैपोषम्, धनपोषम्, गोपोषम्, अश्वपोषम्. Such _sutras_ are called पित्.\n\nThen in _sutra_ (II. 4. 23), we have an example of जित्. \"A _Tatpurusha_ compound ending with the word सभा 'court' is neuter, provided that it is preceded by the word _raja_, or by a word denoting a non-human being.\" Here the synonyms only of the word '_raja_' are taken, and neither the word-form '_raja_,' nor the special instances falling under it. Thus इन 'king' + सभा = इनसभम् 'king's assembly,' ईश्वर + सभा = ईश्वरसभम् 'king's assembly.' But not राजसभम्, but राजसभा. Nor can we take particular kings, such as चन्द्रगुप्त or पुष्पमित्र. In their case we must have पुष्पमित्रसभा, चन्द्रगुप्तसभा.\n\nThen in _sutra_ (IV. 4. 35), we have an example of झित्. The _sutra_ means \"the words पक्षि 'bird' मत्स्य 'fish' मृग 'deer,' take the affix ठक् when the meaning is the killer thereof.\" Here the words पक्षि &c. denote both the word-forms पक्षि &c. as well as the species denoted by those terms, but not their synonyms. Thus पक्षि + ठक् = पाक्षिकः 'a bird-killer,' मात्स्यिकः, 'a fish-catcher.' शकुनि + ठक् = शाकुनिकः 'a vulture-killer.' But we cannot take the synonyms of 'पक्षि,' &c. except in the case of 'मत्स्य,' when we may take the word 'मीन.' As मात्स्यिकः and मैनिकः a fish killer.'",
    "11069": "The _pratyahara_ अण् in thus _sutra_ includes all the vowels and liquids. This is the only instance where अण् _pratyahara_ refers to the second ण् of लण्. The letters included in अण्, and the letters having an indicatory उ, refer to, and include their homogeneous letters also. Thus कु refers to all the five gutturals क, ख, ग, घ, ङ, similarly चु, टु, तु, and पु, as in _sutra_ (1. 3. 8). Similarly अ includes short, long and protracted अ. The words 'its own form' are understood in this _sutra_, being drawn from the previous _sutra_. Thus _sutra_ आद्गुणः (VI. 1. 87), 'when a vowel comes after अ, _guna_ is the single substitute for both.' Here though the rule mentions only short अ, we take the long आ also. Thus not only नर + ईशः = नरेशः; but महा + ईशः = महेशः । So also in _sutra_ अस्य च्वौ (VII. 4. 32), 'there is long ई in the room of अ when the affix '_chvi_' (V. 4. 50) follows.' Here long आ is also included; thus कृष्ण + करोति = कृष्णीकरोति, and खट्वा + करोति = खट्वीकरोति. So also in _sutra_ यस्येति च (VI. 4. 148). 'When long ई follows, there is elision of the इ or अ of the base,' the rule applies to the bases ending in long ई and आ also.\n\nThis rule of course does not apply to affixes. Thus _sutra_ (III. 2. 168), says, 'after words ending in the affix _san_, and the words _asansa_ and _bhiksha_, there is उ.' Here उ is an affix and therefore does not include long ऊ. Thus भिक्षुः 'a beggar.' So also in (IV. 3. 9), the short अ only is to be taken and not the long one.",
    "11070": "By the previous _sutra_ it was declared that a vowel standing by itself included all the letters of its class. Thus अ includes आ; and इ, ई; &c. This _sutra_ lays down the rule by which the very form of the letter is taken and not all the letters of its class. This is done by placing a त् either after or before the letter. Thus अत् means the very letter अ and not all its homogeneous letters. Similarly उत् means short उ only and not long or protracted उ. We had to refer to this _sutra_, in our very first _sutra_, in explaining the term आत्.\n\nThe _sutra_ consists of two words तपरः and तत्कालस्य. _Taparah_ means that which has a त् after it or that which is after त्. _Tat_-_kala_ means having the same time. According to time the vowels are divided into short, long and protracted. Short vowels have one measure, long vowels two, and protracted vowels three. A consonant lasts half the time of a short vowel. Therefore a letter preceded or followed by त्, refers to its own form as well as to those only of its homogeneous letters which have the same time. Thus the letter अत् will include the _udatta_, _anudatta_, _svarita_ (both nasalised and non-nasalised) अ and not the long and protracted forms. \n\nThis _sutra_ declares an injunction. The _anuvritti_ of अण् of the previous _sutra_ does not run into this _sutra_. Any other letter than अण् may be followed by त् and the rule of this _sutra_ will apply to that also. This rule qualifies the previous _sutra_ which would therefore mean that an अण् letter which is not followed or preceded by a त् includes its homogeneous letters also.\n\nThus in the _sutra_ (VII. 1. 9) अतोभिस ऐस्. 'After words ending in अत् (i. e. short अ), ऐस् takes the place of भिस्.' Thus वृक्षः. But in खट्वा which ends in long आ and whose prosodial time is different from अ, this rule will not apply, and we have खट्वाभिः.",
    "11071": "This _sutra_ explains the mode of interpreting _pratyaharas_. Thus the _pratyahara_ अक् means those letters whose beginning is अ and whose final इत् is क्.\n\nWhy do we say with 'the final indicatory letter?' Because a _pratyahara_ like सुट् would be otherwise ambiguous. It might be doubted whether it is formed with the final ट् of औट् and refers to the first five case-affixes, or whether it is formed with the initial ट् of टा and therefore refers to the first seven case-affixes. The present _sutra_ clears up the doubt. A _pratyahara_ is formed with the final इत् and not with the initial इत्.",
    "11072": "This _sutra_ consists of three words :- येन 'by what (attribute),' विधिः 'rule,' तदन्तस्य 'having that (attribute) at its end.'\n\nThis is a rule of interpretation. When a rule is made with regard to a particular attribute or letter, it means also words having those attributes or letters at their end. Thus there is a rule (III. 1. 97) declaring \"let there be the affix यत् after the vowels.\" Here the phrase \"after the vowels\" means and includes \"after the roots ending in vowels, as well as roots consisting of a single vowel.\" Thus चि + यत् = चेयम्. Therefore, this _sutra_ means that when a rule is laid down in this grammar with regard to a particular attribute, that rule, besides being applicable to that particular attribute, is also applicable to words ending in that particular attribute. Thus a rule laid down generally with regard to vowels, will apply to words ending in vowels; a rule laid down with regard to certain forms, will apply to words ending in those forms.\n\nThus the _sutra_ एरच् (III. 3. 56) 'after इ there is अच् 'declares that the affix _ach_ would come not only after इ, but after any expression that ends in इ. Thus इ + अच् = अयः, चि + अच् = चयः ॥\n\nVart:- The present rule, (called _tadanta_-_vidhi_) must not be applied to rules relating to compounds (_samasa_), and to _pratyayas_ (affixes). Thus _sutra _ (II. 1. 24), declares that a word in the accusative case is compounded with the words _srita_, _atita_ &c. As कष्टं + श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः 'involved in pain.' The present _sutra_ must not be applied here, and we cannot say that a word in the accusative case would be compounded with another that ends in _srita_; for _tadanta_-_vidhi_ does not apply here. Hence we cannot form a compound of कष्टं + परमश्रितः ॥\n\nSimilarly, in rules of affixes. Thus _sutra_ (IV. 1. 99) declares \"that the words नड &c., take the affix फक्.\" Thus नड+ फक् = नाडायनः । But we cannot apply the affix _phak_ to the word सूत्रनड, the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ not being applicable here. The descendant of सूत्रनड will be called सोत्रनाडि and not as above.\n\nThe above _vartika_ is however qualified by the following:\n\nVart:- The above _vartika_ does not apply to words formed by affixes that have an indicatory उक् (उ, ॠ, लृ), short or long, or where a rule is propounded with regard to letters. Thus the affix _ktavatu_ (I. 1. 26) has an indicatory उ, and we have कृतवत्. A rule which will apply to _kritavat_ will apply also to the word which ends in _kritavat_. Thus the feminine of _kritavat_ is कृतवती (IV. 1. 6), the feminine of _sukritavat_ will be _sukritavati_. Similarly rule (IV. I. 95) अत इञ् says \"after अ there is the affix इञ्.\" This is a rule relating to _pratyayas_, but as it is propounded by mere letters, the rule of _tadanta_-_vidhi_ will apply here. Thus दक्ष + इञ् = दाक्षि 'the son of _Daksha_.'\n\nVart:- When a term, which denotes a letter, is exhibited in a rule in the form of the locative case and qualifies something else which likewise stands in the locative case, that which is qualified by it must be regarded as beginning with the letter which is denoted by the term in question, and not as ending with it.\n\nThus _sutra_ (VI. 4. 77), _achi_ _snu_ _dhatu_ _bhruvam_ _yvor_ _iyan_ _uvanau_, means \"_iyan_ and _uvan_ are the substitutes of what ends with the _pratyaya_ _snu_ and what ends in a verbal root in इ or उ, whether long or short, and of the inflective base _bhru_, when an affix beginning with a vowel follows.\" Here the word '_achi_' is exhibited in the seventh case, which literally means 'when a vowel follows;' but by virtue of the present _vartika_ it means, 'when an affix beginning with a vowel follows,' as, श्रियः, भ्रुवः ॥",
    "11073": "This defines the word वृद्धम्. The _sutra_ consists of five words :- वृद्धिः 'the _vriddhi_ vowel;' यस्य 'whose,' अचाम् 'among the vowels,' आदिः 'is first;' तद् 'that; वृद्धम् 'is called _vriddham_.'\n\nIf a word consisting of many vowels, has a _vriddhi_ vowel coming first in the order of vowels, that word is called _vriddham_. Thus the words माला, शाला &c., have the first vowel आ a _vriddhi_ vowel, therefore, they are called _vriddham_.\n\nThe word _vriddham_ has been defined in order to make applicable to these peculiar words certain _taddhita_ affixes. Thus there is a rule (IV. 2. 114) by which the affix छ् is added to _vriddham_. Thus माला + छ् = मालीयः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"the first?\" Because a word like सभासंनयनः, which is not a _vriddha_ word, will not admit of the affix छ्. Its corresponding derivative will be साभासंनयनः ॥\n\nVart:- A proper noun, though not coming under the above definition, may yet be regarded optionally as a _vriddham_. Thus देवदत्त + छ् = देवदत्तीया, or we may have दैवदत्ता.\n\nVart:- A compound ending in a _Gotra_ word, is regarded for the purposes of the addition of this affix, as if it was not compounded. Thus रौढि is a _Gotra_ word and also _vriddham_. Its compound घृतरौढि will be regarded as a _vriddham_ too, for the addition of the affix. As घृतरौढि + छ् = घृतरौढीयाः 'the students of _Ghritaraudhi_.' So also ओदनपाणिनीयाः, वृद्धाम्भीयाः वृद्धकाश्यपीयाः &c.\n\nVart:- Exception must be made in the case of जिह्वाकात्य and हरितकात्य । They do not take छ्. Thus जैह्वाकाता and हारितकाताः.",
    "11074": "The त्यद् &c. have been given in the list of _sarvanamas_. See _sutra_ (I. 1. 27). These words are also called _vriddham_. Thus तद् + छ् = तदीयम्, एतदीयम्, मदीयम् इदमीयम्, अदसीयम्, त्वादायनिः, मादायनिः &c.",
    "11075": "As गोनर्द is a country of the east, it is a _vriddham_ word and we have गोनर्द + छ् = गोनर्दीयः; similarly एणीपचनीयम्, भोजकटीयः.\n\nThe word _prak_ in the _sutra_ has been differently interpreted. The Grammarian _Kunin_ takes the word _prak_ as an epithet qualifying the word _acharya_, 'professor' understood. In that case the _sutra_ will be thus translated:- 'In the opinion of the Eastern (or ancient) professors, a word that has the letters e and o as the first among its vowels, and is the name of a country, is called _vriddham_.' Under this interpretation, this will be an optional rule only, giving the opinion of eastern or ancient grammarians.\n\nOthers however take the word _prak_ as qualifying the word _desa_ and the meaning then is as given in the text.\n\nWhy do we say 'having the letters ए and ओ'? If a simple vowel is first among the vowels, of a word, that word will not be called _vriddham_: and as such will not take the affix छ्; as आहिच्छत्रः, कान्यकुब्जः. \n\nWhy do we say of 'Eastern country'? Because this rule does not apply to a word like देवदत्तः which is the name of a town in the _Punjab_, which is not an eastern country. Its secondary derivative will be दैवदत्तः, born in _Devadatta_.\n\nWhy do we say 'country'? The rule will not apply to rivers &c. Thus from गोमति we have गौमताः 'fish born in the river _Gomati_.'",
    "12001": "This is an _atidesa_ _sutra_, and makes certain affixes, though not having an indicatory ङ्, to produce the same effect as if they were really ङित्.\n\nThe root गाङ् is substituted for the verb इङ् in certain tenses, in which the verb इङ् is defective (II. 4. 49). The कुटादि verbs are roots belonging to the _Tudadi_ class of verbs, and they are forty roots beginning with कुट् 'to be crooked' and ending with कुङ् 'to groan.'\n\nAfter these roots all affixes are treated as if they were marked with a ङ् with the exception of those affixes which are ञित् or णित्.\n\nThus from गाङ् we have in the aorist the form अध्यगीष्ट; which is thus evolved. अधि + अद् + इङ् + सिच् + त = अध्य + गा + स् + त (II. 4. 50.) = अध्य + गी + स्त (VI. 4. 66) = अध्यगीष्ट 'he studied,' अध्यगीषातां 'they two studied'; अध्यगीषत 'they studied.' Here by (VI. 4. 66), the आ is changed into ई before the affix सिच्, which is regarded as ङित्.\n\nSimilarly, after the verbs कुट् &c., all affixes are treated as ङित्, with the exceptions already mentioned.\n\nThus कुट् + तृच् (III. 1. 133) = कुट् + इट् + तृच् (VII. 2. 35) = कुटितृ, nominative singular कुटिता 'who acts crookedly.' Here the affix तृच् being, regarded as ङित् does not cause the _guna_ substitution of the उ of कुट्, by (I. I. 15).\n\nSimilarly with the affixes तुमुन् and तव्यम्, we have कुटितुम् and कुटितव्यम्. So on with all the forty roots of _kutadi_ class : e.g. उत्पुटिता, उत्पुटितुम्, उत्पुटितव्यम्.\n\nBut the affixes marked with ञ् or ण् will not be so treated. Thus णिच् by which causatives are formed, is such an affix; e.g. उत्कुट् + णिच् + शप् + तिप् = उत्कोट् + इ + अ + ति = उत्कोटयति. Here there is _guna_ of the उ of कुट्. So also before the affix णल् of the perfect tense, we have उच्चुकोट, and before the affix ण्वुल् we have उत्कोटकः ।\n\n_Vartika_:- The root व्यच् 'to deceive,' is also treated like _kutadi_ verbs, except before the affix अस्. As विचिता 'he shall deceive,' विचितुम् 'for the purpose of deceiving' विचितव्यम् &c. Here there is _samprasarana_ before the _nit_ terminations ता, तुम् and तव्यम् and the य of व्यच् is changed into इ by rule (VI. I. 16).\n\nBut the affix अस् is not _nit_ and consequently there is no _samprasarana_ before it. Thus उरुव्यचाः 'an imp.'",
    "12002": "The root विज् does not strengthen its vowel before the affixes that take the intermediate इ, because those terminations are treated like ङित् affixes. The root विज् belongs to the _Tudadi_ class. Thus उद्विजिता 'he will be agitated,' उद्विजितुम् 'for the purpose of being agitated,' उद्विजितव्यम् 'ought to be agitated.'\n\nBut those affixes, which are not preceded by the augment इट्, are not like ङित्, and they consequently produce their own proper action, such as _gunation_ &c. As उत् + विज् + ल्युट् = उद्वेजनम्, उद्वेजनीयम् 'that which ought to be agitated.'",
    "12003": "Thus before the इडादि termination इता of the future, we may have either प्रोर्णुविता or प्रोर्णविता \"he will cover.\"\n\nThe equation of the form is :- प्र + ऊर्णु + इ + ता = प्र + ऊर्णुव् + इता (VI. 4. 77) = प्रोर्णुविता. When the affix is not regarded as ङित्, it produces _guna_, and we have the second form प्रोर्णविता ॥\n\nOf course there is no option allowed before those affixes which do not take the augment इट्, and before those terminations, consequently, we have only one form : as प्रोर्णु + ल्युट् = प्रोर्णो + अनम् = प्रोर्णवनम्, 'covering,' प्रोर्णवनीयम् 'which ought to be covered.'",
    "12004": "The terminations which are added to roots are either _Sarvadhatuka_ or _ardhadhatuka_. The _Sarvadhatuka_ terminations are all those that are marked with a श् and also the tense terminations called तिङ्, the latter are the following:-\n\n_Parasmaipada_\n\n- 3rd Person. तिप् तस् झि\n- 2nd Person. सिप् थस् थ\n- Ist Person. मिप् वस् मस्\n\n_Atmanepada_\n\n- 3rd Person. त आताम् झ\n- 2nd Person. थास् आथाम् ध्वम्\n- Ist Person. इट् वहि महिङ्\n\nExcept the terminations marked with a प् such as ति, सि and मि, &c., all the other _Sarvadhatuka_ terminations are ङित्. The शित् terminations like शतृ, शानच्, &c., are also _Sarvadhatuka_ terminations. These affixes are also ङित्, unless they have a प् as indicatory, as शप्. Thus the affix as तस्, being an अपित् _Sarvadhatuka_ affix, is a ङित्, and before it the vowel is not _gunated_ e. g. कुरुतः 'they two do.' The equation is :- कृ + उ + तस् (the उ is added by Rule (III. 1. 79)) = कर् + उ + तस् (VI. 4. 110) = कुरु + तस् = कुरुतः ॥ Similarly कुर्वन्ति 'they do.'\n\nHere the अ of कर् is changed into उ and we have कुर्, by virtue of rule (VI. 4. 110), which declares that the अ of the verb कर् is changed into उ before those _Sarvadhatuka_ affixes which are ङित् or कित्. Here तस् is a _Sarvadhatuka_ ङित् affix by the present rule, and hence the change.\n\nThese four _sutras_ describe the ङित् terminations.\n\nWhy do we say 'a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix'? Because an _ardhadhatuka_ affix, though not being marked with an indicatory प् will not be a ङित्. As कर्त्ता 'doer,' कर्तुम् 'to do,' कर्तव्यम् 'duty.'\n\nWhy do we say 'not having an indicatory प्'? If a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix has an indicatory प् it will not be _nit_. As कृ + उ + तिप् = करोति 'he does' करोषि 'thou doest,' करोमि 'I do.'",
    "12005": "With this _sutra_ begins the description of affixes which are regarded as कित् though not actually having a क् to mark them as such. The terminations of लिट् (Perfect) not being पित् terminations, are कित्, after verbs that have no compound consonants. The phrase अपित् (not being marked with प्) qualifies this _sutra_ also, being drawn from the previous _sutra_ by the rule of _Anuvritti_.\n\nThus from भिद् 'to tear' the Reduplicated non _pit_ second person perfect is बिभिदतुः 'thou hast torn.' बिभिदुः 'They have torn.'\nSimilarly चिच्छिदतुः 'thou hast divided'; चिच्छिदुः 'you divided'; ईजतुः and ईजुः.\n\nThis rule will not apply if the root ends in a conjunct consonant. Thus स्रंस् 'to fall down' forms its second person Perfect :- सस्रंस् + अतुस् = सस्रंसतुः. Here the affix is not treated as _kit_; for had it been so treated, it would have caused the elision of the penultimate nasal (_anusvara_) of स्रंस by Rule (VI. 4. 24). Similarly from ध्वंस् we have दध्वंसे.\n\nThe _pit_ terminations of the Perfect are not _kit_; and therefore we have बिभेद 'he has divided,' where the root is _gunated_ before the 3rd person singular termination णल् which is a पित् termination, because it being the substitute of तिप् is regarded like तिप् by (I. 1. 56).",
    "12006": "After these two roots the terminations of the Perfect are कित्. These roots have been especially mentioned, because the root इन्धि ending in a compound consonant will not be governed by _sutra_ (I. 2. 5); and the root भू is mentioned because all the terminations of the Perfect are कित् after भू, not excepting the पित् terminations. Thus the verbs समीधे and ईधे are illustrations of Perfect Tense from the root इन्ध् as in the following examples :- समीधे दस्युहन्तमम्, (_Rig_ _Veda_ VI. 16. 15), and पुत्र ईधे अथर्वणः, (_Rig_ _Veda_ VI. 16. 14). Here the nasal of the root is dropped by regarding the affix as कित् ॥ Similarly from the root भू, we have बभूव, वभूविथ ॥\n\nVart.:- This rule should be applied also to the verbs श्रंथ् 'to loosen,' श्रंथ् 'to fasten,' दंभ् 'to injure' and स्वंज् 'to embrace.' As श्रेथतुः 'thou hast loosened,' श्रंथ + अतुस् = श्रथ् + अतुस्. (The न् is elided by the rule already mentioned in the last _sutra_, viz. (VI. 4. 24).\n\n= श्रथ् + श्रथ् + अतुस् = श्रेथतुः (VI. 4. 120), Similarly श्रेथतुः; देभतुः, परिषस्वजे, परिषस्वजाते.",
    "12007": "After these seven verbs, the gerundial _ktva_ is _kit_. It might be said, what was the necessity of this _sutra_? The affix _ktva_ is clearly a _kit_ affix, as it is marked with the diacritical letter क्, and it was useless to call it a _kit_ affix after these verbs. The reason of this apparent repitition is this. Though _ktva_ is a _kit_ affix generally; yet there is a later _sutra_ in this chapter (I. 2. 18) which declares that the prefix क्त्वा is not कित्, if it is preceded by the intermediate इ. Or in other words, if क्त्वा is added to those verbs, which are called सेट् verbs, viz., that take an intermediate इ, it is not then _kit_. Thus the verb शी 'to sleep' is सेट्. Therefore शी + इ + त्वा = शे + इ + त्वा = शायित्वा.\n\nNow it happens that all the seven verbs mentioned in the _sutra_ are सेट् verbs, and take an intermediate इ. The क्त्वा before these verbs would have lost its _kitness_ by virtue of _sutra_ 18; therefore arose the necessity of this _sutra_, to provide in anticipation an exception to that _sutra_, in favour of these verbs, where the affix _ktva_ is necessarily _kit_. Thus we have मृडित्वा 'being gracious,' मृदित्वा 'having squeezed,' गुधित्वा 'having wrapped' कुषित्वा 'having torn,' क्लिशित्वा 'having suffered,' उदित्वा 'having spoken,' उषित्वा 'having dwelt.' The व v of वद् and वस् are changed into उ by the rule of _Samprasarana_ (VI. 1. 15).\n\nMoreover in the case of the verbs गुद्, कुष् and क्लिश्, _sutra_ 26 would have made क्त्वा optionally _kit_; the present _sutra_ makes it necessarily so.",
    "12008": "After the above mentioned verbs the _ktva_ though taking an intermediate इ, and the affix सन् are कित्. The affix सन् is employed in forming desiderative verbs. The न् of सन् is इत्, the real affix being स. The root is reduplicated before this सन् affix. Thus रुदित्वा 'having cried,' रुरुदिषति 'he wishes to cry'; विदित्वा 'having known,' विविदिषति 'he wishes to know'; गृहीत्वा (VI. 1. 16.) 'having taken,' जिघृक्षति 'he wishes to take'; मुषित्वा 'having stolen,' मुमुषिषति 'he wishes to steal'; सुप्त्वा (VI. 1. 15) 'having slept,' सुषुप्सति 'he wishes to sleep,' पृष्ट्वा (VI. I. 16) 'having asked' पिपृच्छिषति 'he wishes to ask.' The verb ग्रह् is changed into गृह्, स्वप् into सुप्, प्रच्छ् into पृच्छ before _kit_ affixes by _samprasarana_ (VI. 1. 16.)\n\nThe _ktva_ and _san_ would have been optionally _kit_ after the verbs रुद्, विद् and मुष् by virtue of Rule 26 of this chapter, but this _sutra_ makes them necessarily so, after these three verbs. In the case of the verb ग्रह्, these affixes are _kit_ by virtue of this _sutra_ only. In the case of the verbs स्वप् and प्रच्छ् the affix क्त्वा is of course _kit_, because these two verbs are _anit_, that is, they do not take the intermediate इ; and therefore the क्त्वा being directly affixed to them, and rule 18 not applying, the indicatory k would make it _kit_. In reference to these verbs, therefore, the present _sutra_ teaches something new, only with regard to the affix सन्, by making that also _kit_. The verb प्रच्छ् takes the intermediate इ when the affix सन् follows, by virtue of _sutra_ (VII. 2. 75).",
    "12009": "In this _sutra_ there is the _anuvritti_ of सन् only and not of क्त्वा. The _sutra_ literally translated means:-\"After _ik_ the _jhal_.\" The _Pratyahara_ इक् contains the four letters इ, उ, ऋ, लृ. The _Pratyahara_ झल् contains all the consonants, except the nasals and the liquids. After the verbs ending in इक् the desiderative suffix सन् is _kit_, when it is झलादि, that is to say when the affix सन् does not take the intermediate इ. The affix सन् is an affix which begins with स् a letter of the झल् class. But if the intermediate इ is added before it, it is no longer a झलादि affix, and in that case it is not कित्. Thus from जि 'to conquer,' which is a verb ending in इक्, we have जिगीषति 'he wishes to conquer', यु 'to mix' युयूषति; so also कृ 'to do,' चिकीर्षति, तृ 'to cross' तितीर्षति, भू 'to be' बुभूषति ।\n\nIf however, verbs ending in इ or उ or ऋ or लृ, take an intermediate इ, they likewise take _guna_. As:- स्मि 'to smile' takes _guna_, and makes its desiderative सिस्मयिषति.\n\nThe झलादि सन् is not _kit_ after verbs ending in any other letter than the इक्. As पिपासति (from पा) 'he wishes to drink.' So from स्था we have तिष्ठासति.\n\nThe object of making the affix सन् _kit_ affix after verbs ending in _ik_ vowels, is to prevent the _guna_ of the vowel of the root, as in चिचीषति 'wishes to collect', तुष्टूषति 'wishes to praise.' To this it might be objected \"this cannot be : for rule (VI. 4. 16) (when सन् beginning with a _jhal_, i.e., not preceded by the augment इट् follows, a long vowel is the substitute of verbs ending in a vowel, and of the verbs हन् and गम्) would prevent _guna_ by substituting long vowel.\" To this it may be replied: \"if rule (VI. 4. 16), enjoining long vowel, debars rule (VII. 3. 84) requiring _guna_, it should a fortiori debar rule (VI. 4. 51) which requires the elision of the affix णि before _Ardhadhatuka_ affixes not taking the augment इट्. But evidently that is not so; for the elision of णि is not debarred by (VI. 4. 16). Therefore, the present _sutra_ is made, so that even by giving scope to the rule of lengthening, the affix सन् be treated as कित्.\" Thus in चिचीषति scope is given to rule (VI. 4. 16), and the vowel is lengthened. But this rule in its turn will be debarred in those cases where rule (VI. 4. 51) will apply : in such cases the maxim contained in (I. 4. 2) is our guide, and a subsequent rule will debar a prior rule of _Panini_ when both find their scope in a single case. Thus in forming the desiderative of the verb ज्ञप् 'to inform,' both the rules (VI. 4. 16) and (VI. 4. 51) present themselves, but the latter prevails. The verb ज्ञप् belongs to the _churadi_ class of verbs, and takes the affix णिच्. Thus ज्ञप् + णिच् + सन् + तिप्; here the present _sutra_ comes into force, and सन् being treated as कित्, the _guna_ of the इ of ज्ञपि is prevented. Thus _sutra_ (VII. 3. 84) requiring _guna_ being set aside, _sutra_ (VI. 4. 51) comes into play, and causes the elision of णिच् and we have ज्ञप् + स + ति = ज्ञीप्सति (VII. 4. 55) (आ changed to ई) 'he wishes to inform.'",
    "12010": "Thus from भिद् 'to pierce' we have बिभित्सति 'he wishes to break,' here the root भिद् contains the _ik_ vowel इ; it ends in a consonant द्; the affix सन् is directly added without taking an intermediate इ, and therefore it fulfils all the conditions of the _sutra_; and the vowel is not _gunated_.\n\nIf the final consonant of the verb is not preceded by a vowel of the _ik_ class, the affix सन् is not _kit_ after such a verb. As यज् + सन् + ते = यियक्षते 'wishes to sacrifice.' Had the affix सन् been here a _kit_ affix, there would have been _samprasarana_ by rule (VI. 1. 16) which declares that there is _samprasarana_ of the verbs वच्, स्वप्, and यज् &c., before _kit_ affixes. \n\nIf the _san_ takes the intermediate इ and is then no longer a झलादि सन् it is not _kit_; and causes _gunation_ etcetera. As वृत् + इ + सन् = विवर्तिषते 'he desires to be.' Here there is _guna_ of _ri_.\n\nRoots like दम्भ्, तृंह् &c., are governed by this rule, though they end in conjunct consonants, for the word हल् of the _sutra_ means _jati_ or class; thus दम्भ् + सन् + तिप् = दभ् + सति (VI. 4. 24), the _m_ being elided by treating सन् as कित्) = धीप्सति or धिप्सति (VII. 4. 56).",
    "12011": "The _sutra_ consists of two words लिङ्सिचौ and आत्मनेपदेषु, literally meaning \"the affixes _lin_ and _sich_ in the _Atmanepada_.\" The other phrases, given in the above text must be supplied from the previous _sutras_, to complete the sense. The _anuvritti_ of the word सन्, that began with _sutra_ (I. 2. 8), does not extend further. As:- भित्सीष्ट 'may he break' and भुत्सीष्ट 'may he know,' अभित्त 'he broke', अबुद्ध 'he knew.'\n\nThus the root भिद् ends with a simple consonant, is preceded by इ a letter of _ik_ _pratyahara_ ; after this root the _jhaladi_ affix सीष्ट of Benedictive in the _Atmanepada_ is treated like कित्; therefore there is no _guna_ substitution of the vowel of the root before this affix. भिद् + सीष्ट = भित्सीष्ट. Similarly in the Aorist we have अभित्त = अ + भिद् + सिच् + त, the स of the Aorist being elided by (VIII. 2. 26). So also बुध् + सीष्ट = भुत् + सीष्ट (VIII. 2. 37) = भुत्सीष्ट.\n\nIf the final consonant is not preceded by an _ik_ vowel, this rule will not apply. Thus Ben. यज् + सीष्ट = यष् + सीष्ट (VIII. 2. 36) = यक् + सीष्ट (VIII. 2. 41) = यक्षीट (VIII. 3. 58). Similarly its Aorist is अयष्ट. Had the affixes सीष्ट and त been _kit_, they would have caused _samprasarana_ of य by (VI. 3. 16).\n\nThis rule will not apply, if the Benedictive and Aorist affixes are _Parasmaipadi_. Thus the Aorist of सृज् 'to let off,' is अ + सृज् + सीत् = अ + सृज् + अ + ज् + सीत् (VI. 1. 58) = अस्रज् + सीत् (VI. 1. 77) = अस्राक्षीत् (VII. 2. I). Similarly from दृश् we have Aorist _Parasmaipadi_ अद्राक्षीत्. Had the Aorist been कित्, rule (VI. 1. 58) (अम् is the augment of the verbs सृज् and दृश् when an affix beginning with a _jhal_ and not having an indicatory क् follows), would not have applied.\n\nThis rule will also not apply, if the verb ends in a vowel. Thus of the verb चि, we have Ben. चेषष्टि, Aor. अचेष्ट. Had the affixes been कित्, there would have been no _guna_ substitution of _i_ into _e_.\n\nThe rule will not apply, if these affixes are not _jhaladi_, but take the augment इट्. Thus Ben. वृत् + इषीष्ट = वर्तिषीष्ट, so also Aorist अवर्तिट. Had they been कित्, there would have been no _guna_ substitution.\n\nThis rule, of course, is confined to the Benedictive and the Aorist. Other tenses will not be affected by this rule. Thus the Ist and 2nd Future of द्विष् is द्वेष्टा and द्वेक्ष्यति.",
    "12012": "As from कृ 'to do' the benedictive is कृषीष्ट 'may he do.' So also सिच्, as अकृत 'he did.' So also हृषीष्ट and अहृत.\n\nOf course this rule would not apply if these terminations take the intermediate इ; as वृ + इषीष्ट = वरिषीष्ट 'may he choose,' (Benedictive); अ + वृ + इष्ट = अवरिष्ट or अवरीष्ट 'he chose or covered,' the इ being lengthened by (VII. 2. 38).",
    "12013": "The verb गम् 'to go' is _Atmanepadi_ after the preposition सम् by Rule (I. 3. 29).\n\nThe result of its being _kit_ is that the nasal is dropped in the _Atmanepada_, in forming the Aorist with सिच्, and the Bencdictive. Thus we have the forms :- संगंसीष्ट or संगसीष्ट in the Benedictive; and समगत or समगंस्त in the _sich_ Aorist. These forms are thus evolved :-\n\nसम्  + गम् + सीष्ट = सम् + ग + सीष्ट (VI. 4. 37) = संगसीष्ट 'may he combine.' Here the nasal म् of गम् is elided by treating the affix सीष्ट as कित् by Rule (VI. 4. 37). In the alternative we have संगंसीष्ट.\n\nSo in the aorist सम् + गम् + सिच् + त = सम् + अट् + गम् + त (VI. 4. 37) = समगत. The सिच् being elided by (VIII. 2. 27) (after a short inflective base, there is elision of सिच्, if a _jhal_ follows). So when म् of गम् is elided by (VI. 4. 37), there remains only ग which is a base ending in short अ, hence, the elision of सिच्. But in the alternative we have समगंस्त.",
    "12014": "As आहत, आहसाताम्, आहसत are the aorist of हन्. When a सिच् or second aorist is _kit_ the verb loses its nasal, by Rule (VI. 4. 37). After the verb हन् the सिच् is only _kit_ and not the Benedictive लिङ् terminations, as was the case in the previous _sutra_; hence the repetition of the word _sich_ in this _sutra_. The _sutras_ (I. 2. 12) and (I. 2. 13) were governed both by लिङ् and सिच्; from and after this _sutra_, the governing power of लिङ् ceases. The governing power of the word \"_Atmanepada_\" in _sutra_ (I. 2. 11) does not however cease, and its _anuvritti_ runs through the succeeding _sutras_; though as regards this _sutra_, its _anuvritti_ is redundant, in as much as before the _Parasmaipada_ terminations, the root हन् is always replaced by वध् in the aorist, there is no necessity of making the affix _sich_ a _kit_. For the object served in making _sich_, _kit_, after the verb हन्, is to elide the nasal, while in the case of वध्, no such purpose can be served.",
    "12015": "The word _gandhana_ means 'to divulge,' 'to make known that which had been concealed.' The verb यम् has various meanings.\n\nThe result of _kit_ is that the nasal is elided. The verb यम् becomes _Atmanepada_ when preceded by the preposition आङ् by rule (1. 3. 28). Thus उत् + आ + यम् + त = उदायत = 'he divulged,' उदायसाताम्, उदायसत, the _sich_ is elided by (VIII. 2. 27) and म् by (VI. 4. 37). When the verb यम् has any other meaning than 'to divulge,' then the सिच् in the _Atmanepada_ is not _kit_; as उदायंस्त पादस् 'he raised the foot.' So also उदायंस्त कूपादुदकम् 'he raised water from the well.' Though here the verb _yam_ is in the transitive form and takes an object after it, yet it is _Atmanepadi_ by Rule (I. 3.75) which declares \"after the verb _yam_ to strive, preceded by सम्, उत् and आङ् when it does not refer to a book, the _Atmanepada_ is employed.\"",
    "12016": "Thus उपायत कन्याम् or उपायंस्त कन्याम् 'he espoused the girl,' उपायत or उपायंस्त भार्याम् 'he espoused his wife.'\n\nThe word '_Upayamana_' in the _sutra_ means 'to accept in marriage,' 'to espouse.' The verb यम् preceded by the preposition उप is _Atmanepadi_ when it means 'to espouse' by Rule (1. 3. 56).",
    "12017": "The roots स्था 'to stand,' दा 'to give,' धा 'to place', दै 'to pity', धे 'to feed', दो 'to cut' change their vowels into इ before the terminations of the Aorist of the _Atmanepada_ ; and those terminations are also _kit_. As उपास्थित, 'he worshipped', उपास्थिषाताम्, उपास्थिषत; 'he gave', अधित 'he fed.'",
    "12018": "We had had occasion to refer to this _sutra_ in explaining _sutra_ (I. 2. 7). The affix _ktva_ (the actual affix being _tva_, the _k_ being merely _it_ or indicatory letter) is on the face of it a _kit_ affix. This _sutra_ however limits its _kitness_ to cases where it is not _set_. If it is _set_, i.e. has before it the intermediate इ it will not be treated like a _kit_ affix. Thus in कृत्वा, हुत्वा, the affix त्वा is added directly to the root कृ 'to do' and हु 'to sacrifice,' without an intermediate इ and therefore the root has not been _gunated_, the affix here being _kit_. But in स्वेदित्वा, देवित्वा, वर्त्तित्वा, from स्विद्, दिव् and वृत् 'to sweat,' 'to shine,' 'to be,' the affix is not _kit_, because there is an intermediate इ before त्वा and the root has been consequently _gunated_.\n\nOf course this _sutra_ relates to क्त्वा _ktva_ only. Other affixes though having an intermediate इ will be treated as _kit_, if they have an indicatory क्. Thus the affix क्तिन् (III. 3. 94) by which feminine nouns are formed from roots is a कित् affix. This affix when सेट्, will remain कित्, as नि + ग्रह् + इट् + क्तिन् = नि + गृह् + इ + ति (VI. 1. 16) = निगृहीतिः (VII. 2. 37). Here there is _samprasarana_ by treating _klin_ as _kit_. So also in उपस्निहितिः and निकुचितिः there is no _guna_. After ग्रह् &c., the affix क्तिन् takes the augment इट् by a _Vartika_ under _sutra_ (VII. 2. 9) which see.",
    "12019": "The _Nishthas_ are _kta_ and _ktavatu_ (see _sutra_ 26, Chapter I). They are obviously _kit_ affixes. But in the case of the above five roots they are not _kit_, and the vowels take _guna_. Thus शयितः slept, शयितवान्, प्रस्वेदितः, प्रमेदितः, प्रक्ष्वेदितः, प्रस्वेदितवान्, प्रमेदितवान्, प्रक्ष्वेदितवान्, प्रधर्षितः, प्रधर्षितवान् &c. In all the above roots the _Nishtha_ affixes are also _set_.\n\nThe roots स्विद् (ञिष्विदा), मिद् (ञिमिदा), क्षिद् (ञिक्षिदा) and धृष् (ञिधृषा) have all long आ as indicatory, as well as the syllable ञि. These roots therefore by Rule (VII. 2. 16) are generally _anit_, and consequently beyond the scope of the operation of the present _sutra_. As स्विन्नः, स्विन्नवान्. But when the _Nishtha_ affixes denote 'a state or condition, _bhava_,' or 'beginning of action,' then the above four roots optionally become _set_. (VII. 2. 17). It is in that case that the present _sutra_ is applicable to them.",
    "12020": "Thus मर्षितः 'forborne', मर्षितवान् 'forbore.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to forbear?' When it has not this sense, the set _nishtha_ will be कित्. As अपमृषितं वाक्यमाह 'he spoke unintelligible language.'",
    "12021": "According to some the _set_ _Nishtha_ suffixes are not _kit_ after the verbs having a penultimate उ if those verbs are used impersonally (_bhava_) or denote the beginning of action (_adi_-_karman_). Thus द्युत् 'to shine', द्युतितमनेन or द्योतितमनेन 'it has been lighted.' Similarly प्रद्योतितः or प्रद्युतितः 'he first illumined.' The word penultimate or _upadha_ has been defined in _sutra_ (I. 2. 65) _ante_.\n\nIf the verb has any other vowel than उ as penultimate, then the rule does not apply. As लिखितमनेन 'written by him.' Here इ is penultimate; and therefore no option is allowed.\n\nThis rule has no application where the _Nishtha_ does not express either भाव 'condition' or 'Impersonal action'; or आदिकर्म 'if beginning of action', but is used as a verbal adjective. As रुचितं कार्षापाणं ददाति 'he gives a shining coin (called _karshapana_).' Here the word रुचित 'shining' is used as adjective.\n\nThe rule applies to the _Nishtha_ which takes the intermediate इ and not to others as प्रभुक्त ओदनः 'the rice that has been eaten.' Here no option is allowed.\n\nThis optional form of past participle is restricted in its scope. Those verbs which take the _vikarana_ शप् i.e., the verbs of the _Bhu_ class &c., admit of this option. Thus गुध् 'to wrap up' belongs to _Divadi_ class, and therefore, its participle has one form only as गुधितं.",
    "12022": "The word 'optionally' of the previous _sutra_ (I. 2. 21) does not govern this _sutra_, because the word 'optionally' has been again used in the next _sutra_ (I. 2. 23); of which there would have been no necessity had the word 'optionally' governing force in this _sutra_, for then this would have also governed the next _sutra_. The _anuvritti_ of न सेट् however is to be read in this _sutra_.\n\nBy rule (VII. 2. 51), after the verb पू the affixes _Nishtha_ and क्त्वा _ktva_ take the intermediate इ. So that क्त्वा _ktva_ being _set_ (by virtue of Rule (VII. 2. 51)) would have been non-_kit_ by Rule 18; and it might be asked what is the necessity of repeating it in this _sutra_, when _sutra_ (I. 2. 18) comprised the case. The reason of this repetition is that by mentioning क्त्वा _ktva_ in this _sutra_, it has governing force over the succeeding _sutras_. As पवितः, पवितवान्.",
    "12023": "The _set_ _ktva_ may or may not be _kit_ after the verbs ending in थ् or फ् preceded by a nasal. The result of being _kit_ will be that nasal will be dropped. In other words the dropping of the nasal is optional in such verbs. Thus from ग्रंथ् we have ग्रथित्वा or ग्रन्थित्वा 'having twisted,' गुफित्वा or गुंफित्वा 'having tied round', श्रथित्वा or श्रन्थित्वा.\n\nThe word \"_Nishtha_\" does not govern this _sutra_, and comes to an end with the last _sutra_.\n\nThis rule does not apply to verbs that have not a penultimate न् though they may end in थ् or फ्. As रेफित्वा 'having reviled', गोफित्वा 'having tied.' Here by rule 18, the त्वा _tva_ being non-_kit_, the vowels of the root रिफ् and गुफ् have been _gunated_.\n\nA verb may have a penultimate न्, but if it has not final थ or फ, the rule does not apply. As स्रंस् + इत्वा = स्रंसित्वा 'having dropped', ध्वंसित्वा 'having killed.' Had it been _kit_, the nasal would have been dropped.",
    "12024": "After the above three verbs, the _ktva_ affix being _set_, may or may not be _kit_. As वचित्वा or वंचित्वा 'having cheated.' So also लुचित्वा or लुंचित्वा 'having plucked', ऋतित्वा or अर्तित्वा 'having dared.'\n\nWhen the verb ऋत् _rit_ takes the affix ईयङ् it is not governed by this _sutra_. See _sutra_ (III. 1. 29).\n1.2.25.md\nWhen the _ktva_ is not _set_, but _anit_, then there is no option allowed. As वच् + क्त्वा = वक्त्वा.",
    "12025": "As तृषित्वा or तर्षित्वा 'having thirsted,' मृषित्वा or मर्षित्वा 'having sprinkled,' कृशित्वा or कर्शित्वा 'having become lean.' By _sutra_ (I. 2. 18), the _set_ _ktva_ is never _kit_. This _sutra_ adds another exception to that general rule.\n\nThe special mention of _Kasyapa_ is for the sake of showing respect. The वा is already understood in this _sutra_ by _Anuvritti_ from _sutra_ (I. 2. 23).",
    "12026": "The wording of this _sutra_ requires a little explanation. It consists of the following words:-\n\n1. रलः _ralah_, ablative of रल् (after the consonants included in the _Pratayahara_ _ral_ i.e., all the consonants except य् _y_ and व् _v_) :- Verbs having their final letter any single consonant except य् _y_ and व् _v_.\n\n2. व्युपधात् and means \"after penultimate वी.\" It is a compound of वी + उपधा. The वी itself is a compound of उ + इ = वि, in the dual वी. Therefore the phrase means \"after (verbs) having for their penultimate either इ _i_ or उ _u_ long or short.\"\n\n3. हलादेः means \"beginning with a consonant.\"\n\nAll these three words qualify the word \"verb\" understood.\n\n4. संश्च means \"and _san_.\"\n\nThe _sutra_ means, those verbs which have a रल् letter in the end, a हल् in the beginning, and an इ, ई or उ, ऊ in their penultimate, may optionally treat the affixes _ktva_ and _san_ as कित्.\n\nThus दद्युत् 'to shine,' makes दद्युतित्वा or द्योतित्वा 'having shone,' लिख् 'to write' makes लिखित्वा or लेखित्वा.\n\nSimilarly in _san_ affix we have लिलिखिषति or लिलेखिषति 'he wishes to write', दिदद्युतिषते or दिद्योतिषते 'wishes to shine.'\n\nThe rule does not apply if the verb ends in a letter other than रल्. As दिव् + क्त्वा = देवित्वा; its desiderative will be दिदेविषति. No option is allowed here.\n\nSimilarly there is no option when the penultimate vowel is not इ or उ. As वृत्त् + क्त्वा = वर्तित्वा Des. विवर्तिषते.\n\nThe rule also does not apply if the verb does not begin with a consonant. As एषित्वा and एषिषिषति. There is no option allowed here.\n\nThe rule does not apply if the क्त्वा and सन् are _anit_. As भुक्त्वा, बुभुक्षते.\n\nIn these 26 _sutras_ the description of affixes which are treated like ङित् and कित् is comprised.",
    "12027": "The उ _u_ having one _matra_ or measure is short, having two measures is long, having three measures is _pluta_. This _sutra_ defines the three kinds of vowels according to their _matra_. The letter ऊ _u_ has been taken to illustrate the rule. The phrase हृस्वदीर्घप्लुतः is a _Dvandva_ compound, in the Singular, and is exhibited in the masculine gender, contrary to the general rule (II. 4. 17).\n\nThe word _kala_ means measure of time required for pronouncing a vowel.\n\nAs दधि 'curd', मधु 'honey'. Here इ and उ are short. कुमारी, गौरी, here ई is long. देवदत्ता३ अन्वास _Devadatta_! Here आ _a_ is _pluta_ or prolated.\n\nThese words are used in the following _sutras_: (1. 2. 47); (VII. 4. 25); (VIII. 2. 82).",
    "12028": "This is a _paribhasha_ _sutra_, and declares the object to which the terms 'short, 'long' and 'prolated' are to be applied. When in this book 'short' 'long' or 'prolated' are taught by using the words _hrasva_, _dirgha_ or _pluta_, they must be understood to apply to vowels. As will be found in the _sutra_ (1. 2. 47) \\[1\\] \"there is the substitution of _hrasva_ or short in the neuter gender of the crude-form.\" The word 'vowel' must be inserted in this _sutra_ to complete the sense. That is:- the _hrasva_ is substituted for the final vowel of the crude-form. As रै अतिरि, नौ अतिनु, गा उपगु.\n\nThe substitution must take the place of vowel and not consonant. As सुवाग् ब्राह्मणकुलम्.\n\nSimilarly _sutra_ (VII. 4. 25) \\[2\\] teaches \"There is the substitution of _dirgha_ or 'long vowel' before all affixes beginning with the letter य्, except _krit_ and _Sarvadhatuka_ affixes.\" Here also the word 'vowel' must be read into the _sutra_ which will then be \"of an inflective base ending in a vowel, the long vowel shall be the substitute &c.\" As चि + यङ् + त = चीयते 'it is collected'; श्रु + य + त = श्रूयते 'it is heard.' Why do we say \"in the place of vowels only\"? The substitution must take place in the room of a vowel and not of a consonant. As भिद् + य + ते = भिद्यते 'it is divided,' छिद्यते 'it is pierced.'\n\nSo also in the case of _pluta_ substitution. Thus rules (VIII. 2. 82) and (VIII. 2. 84) \\[3\\], declare that in calling from a distance, _pluta_ is substituted for the टि portion of the word in the vocative. (The word टि is defined in (I. 1. 64)). Here also the phrase 'of the vowel' must be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense. The _sutra_ will then read:- \"_Pluta_ is substituted in the place of the vowel of the टि &c.\" Thus देवदत्त३, _O_ _Devadatta_! यज्ञदत्त३ _O_ _Yajnadatta_ !\n\nWhy do we say \"in the place of vowels only\"? The substitution must be in the place of the vowel of the टि and not of the consonant. As अग्निचि३त्, सोमसु३त्. Here the syllables इत् and उत् are टि, and the vowels इ and उ have been prolated and not the consonant त्.\n\nThe substitution must be enunciated as such by using the terms, _hrasva_, _dirgha_, and _pluta_. Therefore it is not so here; द्यौः, पन्थाः, सः, द्युभ्याम्, द्युभिः See (I. I. 4).\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - हृस्वो नपुंसके प्रातिपदिकस्य ॥\n- [2] - अकृत्सार्वधातुकयोर्दीर्घः ॥\n- [3] - वाक्यस्यटेः प्लुत उदात्तः ॥ दूराद्धूतेच ॥",
    "12029": "With this _sutra_ begins the description of the three sorts of vowel accents. The accent placed on a vowel by raising the voice is called _udatta_ or acute accent. As अग्निः _agnih_, here _i_ has the acute accent. The _udatta_ is not marked in writing. The word 'vowel' of the previous _sutra_ is understood in this also. These accents are the qualities of letters, and are well known in the sacred and secular literature. The vowel which is perceived as having a high tone is called _udatta_. This tone depends upon the organ from which the vowel is pronounced. In the various organs, such as the throat, palate, &c., if a vowel is pronounced from a higher part of that organ, it is called _udatta_. The vowel in the pronouncing of which there is the restraining and checking of the bodily parts, and in which there is dryness and roughness of tone as well as a contraction of the larynx, is said to have the acute accent. The word is used in _sutra_ (III. I. 3) \\[1\\] \"The first vowel of an affix has the _udatta_ accent.\" As कृ + तव्यम् = कर्तव्यम् _kartavyam_.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - आद्युदात्तश्च ॥",
    "12030": "The word \"vowel\" of _sutra_ (I. 2. 28) is understood in this _sutra_. As अग्निः _agnih_, here अ has the grave accent. The vowel accent known as grave or _anudatta_ is pronounced by lowering the voice. In writing, the _anudatta_ is marked by a line underneath the vowel. The vowel which is uttered from the lower portions of its special place of pronunciation gets the grave accent.\nThis word is used in _sutra_ (III. 1. 4) \\[1\\] \"the case terminations called सुप् and those affixes that have an indicatory प् are _anudatta_\" &c. As त्रयः, बोधयामि.\n\nIn pronouncing an _anudatta_ vowel, there is slackening of the organs, and mildness, as well as softness and sweetness of tone: while there is expansion and widening of the larynx.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - अनुदात्तौ सुप्पितौ ॥",
    "12031": "The word \"vowel\" of s. 28 is understood here also. The _svarita_ or circumflexed accent is pronounced by the combined raising and falling of the voice. It is marked by a perpendicular line on the top of the letter.\nThe word is used in _sutra_ (VI. I. 185) \\[1\\]. \"The affixes having an indicatory त् _t_ have _svarita_ accent.\" As क॒॒न्या॑ _kanya_, शि॒॒क्य॑म् _sikyam_, क्व॑ _kva_.\n\nThis _sutra_ is not to be understood to mean that a _svarita_ is the resultant of the combination of two vowels, an _udatta_ vowel with an _anudatta_ vowel. It means the accent midway between the two well-known qualities of letters known as acute and grave accents.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - तित्स्वरितम् ॥",
    "12032": "It has been defined that _svarita_ accent is a combination of _udatta_ and _anudatta_. It remained doubtful what portion was acute and what grave. The present _sutra_ clears up the difficulty, by declaring that in _svarita_, the first half is accute and the other grave.\n\nThe phrase _ardhahrasva_ is used to indicate half the measure of a short vowel. Thus if a short vowel is _svarita_, its _matra_ being one, half will be _udatta_ and the other half _anudatta_. If a long vowel, whose _matras_ are two, be _svarita_ then 1\/2 will be _udatta_, 1 1\/2 will be _anudatta_. If a _pluta_ (protracted) vowel be _svarita_, then first half measure will be _udatta_, and the remaining 2 1\/2measures will be _anudatta_. In short, the _udatta_ portion of a _svarita_ must not occupy more time than is taken in pronouncing a half short vowel. Thus in शि॒॒क्य॑म् _sikyam_, the _a_ is _svarita_, half being acute, the other half grave or monotony; in क॒॒न्या॑ _kanya_, the long _a_ is _svarita_, its first half measure is acute, the remaining 1 1\/2 is grave; in मानवका॑३ _manavaka_, here a prolated is _svarita_, its first 1\/2 is acute, the balance 2 1\/2 measure is grave.",
    "12033": "Monotony or _Ekasruti_ is that tone which is perceived when a person is addressed; in it there is an absence of all the three tones mentioned above; and there is no definite pitch in it. It is, therefore, the ordinary recitative tone.\n\nThe word '_Sambuddhi_' means here addressing a person from a distance; and has not its technical meaning of the singular number of the vocative case. As आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्ता३ '_O_ boy _Devadatta_! come.' There is vanishing of all the accents in the above case; and the final short vowel of _Devadatta_ is changed into _pluta_ by the rule already referred to in _sutra_ (I. 2. 28) _ante_ ((VIII. 2. 84) दूराद्धूतेच) ॥\n\nIf the person is not addressed from a distance, then the word will get its proper accent.

As ए३विस्वं समत्रिणं दहा३. Here there is no _Ekasruti_.",
    "12035": "The phrase \"_yajna_-_karma_\" is understood here. Even in _yajna_-_karmas_ or sacrifices the word वौषट् may optionally be pronounced in a raised tone. The word वषट् in the _sutra_ signifies वौषट्. But why was not the word वौषट् used in the text? It could have been used with as much case as वषट्. To this natural query, the only answer is, विचित्राः हि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः strange and wonderful is the structure of _Panini_'s aphorisms, Thus सोमस्याग्ने वीही३ वौ३ षट् or सोमस्याग्ने वीही३ वौ३ षट्.",

Even on the occasion of ordinary reading, the _Chhandas_ might be uttered either with the three accents or monotonously. Some say this is a limited option (_vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_).\n\nThe option allowed by this _sutra_ is to be adjusted in this way. In reading the _Mantra_ portion of the _Veda_, every word must be pronounced with its proper accent: but in the _Brahmana_ portion of the _Veda_ there might be _Ekasruti_; while some say there must be _Ekasruti_ necessarily and not optionally in the recitation of the _Brahmanas_.\n\nThus:- अ॒॒ग्निमी॑ले पु॒॒रोहि॑तं or simply अग्निमीले पुरोहितं. \"I praise _Agni_ the _purohita_.\"\n\nThe word वा \"optionally\" of the last _sutra_ could easily have been read into this _sutra_ by the rule of _anuvritti_; why then use the word विभाषा \"optional\" again ? To this we reply, this apparently redundant repetition is for the sake of indicating that the _anuvritti_ of the word यज्ञकर्मणि, which was understood in the last _sutra_, does not extend to this. Had we taken the _anuvritti_ of वा, the other word also would have been attracted; hence the separate use of the word विभाषा.",

By rule (I. 2. 34) read with (I. 2. 36) _ante_, prayers might be optionally uttered with _Ekasruti_ accent. This ordains an exception to that rule In _subrahmanya_ prayers there is no _ekasruti_; and in these hymns, a vowel which otherwise by any rule of grammar would have taken a _svarita_ accent, takes an _udatta_ accent instead.\n\nAs स॒॒ब्रह्म॒॒ण्यो३ मिन्द्रागच्छ॒॒ हरिव॒॒ आगच्छ॒॒.

Thus in इन्द्र, both vowels become _udatta_. In the word आगच्छ, the आ is _udatta_; the next letter which was _anudatta_ becomes _svarita_, and from _svarita_ it is changed to _udatta_ by the present rule. Thus in the sentence इन्द्र आगच्छ the first four syllables are all acutely accented, the fifth syllable is only _anudatta_. So also in हरिव आगच्छ, for the reasons given above, the letters व and च्छ are _anudatta_, the rest are all acutely accented.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - आमन्त्रितस्य च ॥\n- [2] - उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः ॥",

If, however, such an _anudatta_ is followed by an _udatta_ or a _svarita_, it does not become _Ekasruti_ but becomes _sannatara_, i.e. lower than _anudatta_.\n\nThe _sannatara_ is therefore that accent which was originally _anudatta_, and which is preceded by a _svarita_ and is followed by an _udatta_ or a _svarita_. \n\nThis is one explanation of the _sutra_. There is another explanation which does not take the _anuvritti_ of _Ekasruti_ in this _sutra_. The _anudatta_ is replaced by _sannatara_ when such _anudatta_ immediately precedes an _udatta_ or a _svarita_. The _sannatara_ is also called _anudatta_.

    "12043": "This defines or rather describes the _Upasarjana_. In the _sutras_ referring to compounds, the words that have the case termination of the nominative, are called _Upasarjanam_.\n\nThus _sutra_ (II. 1. 24) (द्वितीया श्रितातीत पतितगतात्यस्तप्राप्तापन्नैः) is a _samasa_ _sutra_ enjoining composition. In this _sutra_ the word द्वितीया is exhibited in the nominative case, and the remaining words are in the Instrumental case. The _sutra_ means: \"An accusative (द्वितीया) is compounded with the words श्रित, अतीत, पतित, गत, अत्यस्त, प्राप्त, and आपन्न and forms _Tat_-_purusha_\". Therefore, in forming accusative compounds, the word having the accusative case will be called _Upasarjana_. Thus कष्टं + श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः. Here the word कष्टं being _Upasarjana_, stands first in the compound, by Rule (II. 2. 30). उपसर्जनं पूर्वम्, (in a compound the _Upasarjana_ should be placed first). Similarly in rules relating to the formation of instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive and locative _Tat_-_purusha_, the words standing in those cases will be _Upasarjana_. Thus शंकुलाखण्डः, यूपदारु, वृकभयम्, राजपुरुषः, अक्षशौण्डः.\n\n_Upasarjana_ is, therefore, that word which either by composition or derivation loses its original independent character, while it also determines the sense of another word called प्रधान or principal.",
    "12044": "A word which in the analytical statement of the sense of a compound has one fixed case, whilst the word with which it is compounded may vary its case, is also called _upasarjana_, but does not necessarily stand first.\n\nThat which has one fixed case-termination is called _eka_-_vibhakti_, i.e., a word whose case termination has been determined by a rule of _samasa_ i.e., while the second word in composition with it may take many case-affixes, it takes only one case affix; _apurva_-_nipate_, such a word will be an _upasarajana_ for all purposes, except for the purpose of the rule (II. 2. 30) \\[1\\]which requires an _upasarjana_ to stand first in a compound.\n\nThus the prepositions निः &c, when meaning across &c., are compounded with another word in the ablative case. Though the first word may have any one of the several case terminations, the second member must always be in the fifth (ablative) case, when analytically stated. Ex: निष्क्रान्तः + कौशाम्ब्या = निश्कौशाम्बिः, निष्क्रान्तं + कौशाम्ब्या = निष्कौशाम्बिम्, निष्क्रान्तेन + कौशाम्ब्या = निष्कौशाम्बना, निष्क्रान्ताय + कौशाम्ब्या =  निष्कौशाम्बये, निष्क्रान्ते + कौशाम्ब्या = निकौशाम्बौ.\n\nSimilarly the word निर्वाराणसिः ॥\n\nIf the word, when analytically stated, does not retain the one and the same case, it will not be called _upasarjana_, as the word कुमारी in the compound राजकुमारी, 'the king's daughter,' because राज्ञः + कुमारी = राजकुमारी; राज्ञः + कुमारीम् = राजकुमारी; राज्ञः + कुमार्या = राजकुमार्या, राज्ञः + कुमार्ये = राजकुमार्ये.\n\nHad it been an _upasarjana_, the long ई of री would have been shortened into इ as in the previous example.\n\nThis _upasarjana_, however, contrary to the general rule (II. 2. 30) \\[2\\] cannot stand first in the compound, because there is no such form as कौशाम्बीनिः\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - उपसर्जने पूर्वम् ॥\n- [2] - उपसर्जने पूर्वम् ॥",

The _pratipadika_ is the intermediate stage in the development of a full word (_pada_), from the undifferentiated ore called the _dhatu_ or root. It is that part of a word which is capable of receiving the case-terminations.\n\nThe word अर्थ means having signification. With the exception of verbal roots and affixes, a word-form having a significance or meaning is called a _pratipadika_, as डित्थः 'a wooden elephant,' कपित्थ 'the wood-apple tree,' कुण्डम् 'a bowl,' पीठम् 'a seat.':\n\nWhy do we say \"significant\"? Of course it must have some meaning. Thus of the word वनं, we cannot say that the portion वन् is _pratipadika_; as it has no meaning, and had it been a _pratipadika_, the final न् would have been dropped by Rule (VIII. 2. 7) \\[1\\] (the final न् of a _pratipadika_ is dropped).\n\nThe word must not be a verb, as the word अहन् (the third person sing. number, imperfect tense of हन्) he killed.

Here the word ends in the affix इ of the locative case, and is consequently not a '_pratipadika_' or crude form, but a complete word. Had it been a _pratipadika_, the ए would have been shortened into इ by rule 47 succeeding.\n\nA _nipata_ or particle though not a significant form of a word, yet gets the designation of _pratipadika_ in the opinion of the author of the _Mahabhashya_.

    "12046": "This further explains the use of the word _pratipadika_. \"Suffixes for the formation of nouns are of two kinds. Those by which nouns are derived direct from roots, primary suffixes. Those by which nouns are derived from other nouns, secondary suffixes. The former are called _Krit_, (III. 1. 93) \\[1\\], the latter _Taddhita_ (IV. 1. 76) \\[2\\]. Thus जन _jana_, man, is derived from the root जन् _jan_ by the _krit_ suffix अ; but जनीन _janina_, appropriate for man, is derived from जन _jana_ by the _Taddhita_ affix ईन _ina_. The name _pratipadika_ would apply both to जन _jana_ and जनीन _janina_, as nominal bases ready to receive the terminations of declension\" (Max Muller).\n\nOf the compounds, of which there are six varieties, we had occasion to refer to five already, viz. _Tat_-_purusha_, _Karmadharaya_, _Dvandva_, _Bahuvrihi_ and _Avyayibhava_. They will be fully dealt with in their proper places.\n \nIn the last _sutra_, the words \"not ending in an affix\" were too extensive; this _sutra_ makes an important provision in favour of words ending in _Krit_ or _Taddhita_ affixes. So also compounds are also called _pratipadika_. Being restricted to compounds only, it, of course, does not apply to sentences.\n\nThe words formed by _krit_ affixes are _pratipadika_, as कृ (to do) + ण्वुल् = कृ + वु = कार् + अक = कारक. The affix ण्वुल् is a _krit_ affix, and it is added to the root to form agent by Rule (III. 1. 133) \\[3\\]. The letters ण् and ल् are indicatory, the force of ण् being to cause the _vridhi_ of the vowel of the root. The real affix वु is changed into अक by (VII. 1. 1) \\[4\\]. the affixes यु and वु are replaced by अन and अक respectively. Thus the form कारक is a _pratipadika_, and is capable of declension by receiving case terminations, as कारकः ॥ Similarly कृ + तृच् (III. 1. 133) \\[5\\] = कर्तृ; nom. case कर्ता.\n\nThe word formed by _Taddhita_ affixes are also _pratipadika_; उपगु + अण् = औपगो + अ = औपगव 'the son of the _Rishi_ _Upagu_': nom. case औपगवः. Similarly कापटवः.\n\nIn fact in the chapters treating of these affixes, the derivative substantives formed by them are always shown by the Indian Grammarians in the nominative case singular number. The examples of nouns given in this book will be always declined nouns and not _pratipadikas_, except in peculiar cases. So also in the chapter of _samasa_ or compounds.\n\nThe words ending in compound are _pratipadika_: as राज्ञः + पुरुषः = राजपुरुषः, nom. case राजपुरुषः.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - कृदतिङ् ॥\n- [2] - तद्धिताः ॥\n- [3] - ण्वुल् तृ चौ ॥\n- [4] - युवोरनाकौ ॥\n- [5] - ण्वुल् तृ चौ ॥",
    "12047": "In the neuter gender, the _pratipadika_ that would have ended in a long vowel, changes it into short. Thus अति + रै = अतिरि 'extravagant', as अतिरि = कुलम् 'an extravagant family'; अति लो = अतिलु 'very hairy', अतिलुं कुलं 'a very hairy family.'\n\nThere is no substitution of short vowel, if the noun is not in the neuter gender, as ग्राम + नी = ग्रामणी, nom case ग्रामणीः 'the leader of a village or head-borough.' Similarly सेनानीः 'the leader of an army.'\n\nA word may be in the neuter gender, but if it is not a _pratipadika_, the vowel is not shortened. As काण्डे तिष्ठतः 'two cantos remain.' Here the ए of काण्डे is formed by the coalescence of अ (of the _pratipadika_ काण्ड) and इ (the dual case termination); thus काण्ड + इ = काण्डे. Now it might be urged that here one letter ए replaces two letters अ and इ. Therefore this substitute is equivalent to each of those letters separately, and consequently ए is the vowel of the _pratipadika_ and ought to be shortened. But this is not to be so, because the word _pratipadika_ has been especially mentioned in the text, and therefore this _ekadesa_ is not treated as the final of the form which precedes it.",
    "12048": "The word _upasarjana_ has been defined in _sutra_ (I. 2. 43). In compounds the word गो becomes shortened when it stands last and is an _upasarjana_.\n\nThus चित्र + गो = चित्रगुः 'possessed of a brindled cow.' This is an example of a _Bahuvrihi_ or possessive compound. So also शबलगु 'a spotted cow.' Similarly in those _pratipadika_ _upasarjanas_ which end in feminine suffixes having a final long vowel, there is a shortening. Thus निः + कौशाम्बी = निष्कौशाम्बिः. Here the final long ई is shortened. So also निर्वाराणसिः.\n\nThe word _pratipadika_ of the previous _sutra_ is understood in this. The word गो in the _sutra_ means the form गो and not other words synonym with it. The word स्त्री means \"a word ending in a feminine affix,\" because it has the _svarita_ accent. The word _upasarjana_ qualifies both these words, i. e. when गो is an _upasarjana_ and when a word having a feminine termination is an _upasarjana_.\n\nOther examples are:- अति + खट्वा = अतिखट्वः 'without a bed-stead' अतिमालः 'surpassing a necklace in beauty.'\n\nIf such a word is not an _upasarjana_, there is no shortening, as, राजकुमारी 'the king's daughter.' Here the word राजन् is _upasarjana_, and not the word कुमारी which latter is therefore not shortened. The word must be a derivative word formed by the addition of an affix, which makes it feminine. Thus the words लक्ष्मी, श्री &c. are feminine originally, and are not derived from the masculine nouns, by the addition of any feminine affix. Therefore we have अतिलक्ष्मीः 'surpassing _Lakshmi_ in beauty', अतिश्रीः ॥\n\nVart :- In _Bahuvrihi_ compounds, exception must be made of feminine nouns ending in the affix ईयसी, as बहुश्रेयसी, विद्यमानश्रेयसी ।",
    "12049": "The word लुक् defined in _sutra_ 61, Chapter I, is twice used in this _sutra_. Where a _Taddhita_ affix is elided by the word लुक्, there the feminine suffix of the _pratipadika_ is also dropped, or becomes _luk_. Thus there are certain _Taddhita_ suffixes by which patronymics are formed (one of them being अण्) from other nouns. Before this अण् the initial vowel of the word is _vriddhied_ and the final is _gunated_. Thus सिन्धु 'ocean', forms सिन्धु + अण् = सैन्धो + अ = सैन्धव 'born in ocean or oceanic.' But there are certain words, e. g. श्रविष्ठा, फल्गुणी &c., which are all feminine gender (see _sutra_ (IV. 3. 34) \\[1\\] after which the patronymic suffix is totally elided, without leaving any trace of its action, by using the word _luk_. Thus श्रविष्ठा + (अण्लुक्) = श्राविश्ठः ॥ Here then the present _sutra_ finds its scope. The _Taddhita_ suffix being _luked_; the original feminine termination आ also becomes _luk_. Therefore the 'patronymic derivative of श्रविष्ठा (is not a longer word, as might have been expected) but actually a shorter word, namely श्रविष्ठः; similarly from फल्गुनी if we have फल्गुनः &c.\n\nThus there is a feminine suffix called ङीष् (actually ई) and certain words like इन्द्र &c., (IV. 1. 49) \\[2\\] take an additional suffix called आनुक् (actually आन्). Thus the feminine of इन्द्र will be इन्द्र + आनुक् + ङीष् = इन्द्र + आन् + ई = इन्द्राणी. Now in forming _Dvigu_ compound (Numeral Determinative compound), the _Taddhita_ suffixes are dropped. Thus पंचकपालः 'an offering (_purodash_) made in a dish with five compartments.' In this compound the _Taddhita_ suffix अण् is dropped. Otherwise the form would have been कापालः ॥ Similarly when the word इन्द्राणी forms a _Dvigu_ compound, the _Taddhita_ suffixes are dropped. But not only that, even the original radical affixes are also dropped by force of the present _sutra_. Thus पंचेन्द्रः which means the cake sacred to the five goddesses इन्द्राणी. Here the full form was पंच + इन्द्राणी + अण्. (The suffix अण् has the force of \"sacred to God.\" Thus इन्द्र + अण् = ऐन्द्रं To sacred to God _Indra_). In the above expression, first the _Taddhita_ suffix अण् is _luked_ by rule contained in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 88) \\[3\\] relating to _Dvigu_ compounds: we have the remaining पंच + इन्द्राणी. In this stage, the present _sutra_ comes into force and declares that where a _Taddhita_ suffix has been _luked_, the final feminine suffixes of the _upasarjana_ _pratipadika_ are also _luked_. Therefore, the feminine suffixes आनुक् and ङीष् are also dropped, and we have पंचेन्द्रः which means \"cake sacred to the five _Indranis_ (goddesses).\"\n\nThe word स्त्री and _upasarjana_ of the last _sutra_ are understood in this. By the last _sutra_, a word ending in a feminine affix was told to be shortened when it was an _upasarjana_; this _sutra_ teaches the total suppression of such an affix in special cases. To take another example: Thus Rule (IV. 3. 163) declares फलेलुक् \"_luk_ takes the place of an affix signifying modification or product when fruit is meant.\" Thus यत् is an affix which means modification. Thus गो + यत् = गव्यम् 'cow's milk or the product of cow.' This affix is suppressed when applied to a tree, in the sense of the fruit of the tree. Thus the fruit of the tree आमलकी will be called आमलकं, i. e. first the _Taddhita_ affix is _luked_, and then the feminine affix is also dropped. Similarly fruits of वदरी or बकुली trees are बदरं or बकुलं.\n\nThis rule only applies when a _Taddhita_ affix is elided; and not so when any other affix is _luked_. Thus गार्ग्याः + कुलं = गार्गीकुलम् 'the family of _Gargi_.' Here in forming the _samasa_, the case affix of the word _gargi_ is _luked_ by (II. 4. 71) \\[3\\]. But this suppression of the genitive termination does not necessitate the elision of the feminine affix ई of _gargi_.\n\nThis rule would not also apply if there is no elision by _luk_ of a _Taddhita_ affix, as in गार्गीत्वम्.\n\nNor will the rule apply when the word is not an _upasarjana_. As अवन्ती, कुन्ती, कुरूः.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - श्रविष्ठाफल्गुन्यनुराधास्वातितिष्य पुनर्वसुहस्तविशाखाषाढाबहुलाल्लुक् ॥\n- [2] - इन्द्रवरुणभवशर्वरुद्रमृडीहमारण्ययवयवनमातुलाचार्याणामानुक् ॥\n- [3] - द्विगोर्लुगनपत्ये ॥\n- [4] - सुपो धातुप्रातिपदिकयोः ॥",
    "12050": "By the former _sutra_ when a _Taddhita_ is elided, the long ई of the feminine also required elision. But this rule makes an exception in favor of the word गोणी३ in which, under similar circumstances the short इ replaces the long ई, as in the compound पंचगोणिः  'purchased for five _gonis_.' Here the _Taddhita_ suffix which conveys the meaning of \"purchased for,\" has been rejected after गोणी by (V. 1 28) \\[1\\]. Therefore by previous _sutra_, the feminine suffix  ई also required rejection. But this _sutra_ intervenes and changes the long ई into short इ.\n\nThis _sutra_ is divided into two separate rules by the process called _yoga_-_vibhaga_. Thus इत् is made one _sutra_ by itself, and then it means, when there is a suppression of _Taddhita_ aflix by लुक्, then the long ई is replaced by short इ. Thus purchased with five needles पंचभिः सूचीभिः क्रीतः = पंचसूचिः, दशसूचिः. This is restricted to such examples of purchase only.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - अध्यर्द्धपूर्वद्विगोर्लुगसंज्ञायाम् ॥",
    "12051": "This _sutra_ consists of four words: 1. लुपि, 'where there is a rejection by using लुप्'; 2. युक्तवत् 'appropriate to the same;' 3. व्यक्ति 'gender;' 4. वचनं 'number.' The form _vyakti_ _vachane_ is dual.\n\nWhen a _Taddhita_ affix is _luped_, then the derivative word retains the gender and number of the primitive word. Note the difference between the rejection of a _Taddhita_ by saying 'let there be a लुक्' and 'let there be a लुप्' ॥ The direct action of both words is the rejection of the suffix; but a derivative formed by _luk_ rejection may not retain the number and gender of the original word; while a derivative formed by _lup_ rejection does retain the number and gender of the original word.\n\nThus in the secondary derivative word शिरीषाः, meaning 'a village not far away from शिरीष trees', the masculine gender and plural number of the original word has been retained, though made applicable to a village, which is in the singular number and neuter gender; similarly the word पंचालाः is masculine plural in form though applicable to a single province.\n\nThis _sutra_ is not an approved rule; as will be mentioned by _Panini_ in _sutra_ (I. 2. 53) following and is consequently of little practical importance.\n\nThus पंचालाः are a class of _Kshatriyas_. As such it is masculine gender and plural number. The country in which _Panchalas_ live is also called _Panchalas_; similarly कुरवः, मागधाः &c. There is a rule जनपदेलुप् ((IV. 2. 81), the _lup_ takes the place of an affix when signifying the proper name of a country or kingdom). Thus पंचालाः + अण् (this is one of the affixes forming country) = पंचालाः.\n\nThis rule does not apply when the affix is suppressed by the word लुक् &c. and not लुप्. Thus लवणः सूपः 'salted soup', लवणायवागुः 'salted gruel,' लवणं शाकं 'salted vegetable.' Here the affix उक् has been elided by the word _luk_, by (IV. 4 24). लवणाल्लुक् (after the word _lavana_ the affix is _luked_).\n\nThese derivatives retain only the gender and number of the original, but no other quality. Thus as we have already seen that शिरीषाः, _sirishah_, is the name of a village and is formed by the _lup_ of the affix. Now compounding it with वन we have शिरीषवनम्, 'the forest of the village _Sirisha_.' Here the word शिरीषाः means village, and not trees. Had it meant trees called _sirisha_, then the न of वन would have become  ण optionally by Rule (VIII. 4. 6). (विभाषौषधि वनस्पतिभ्यः ॥ The न of the word वन is optionally changed into ण when preceded by words signifying annual herbs and trees).\n\nVart:- In the case of the words _Haritaki_ &c., the gender only is retained and not the number. As हरीतक्य फलानि 'the fruits of _Haritaki_. Here फलं is neuter in form, while हरीतकी is feminine.\n\nVart:- The words खलतिक &c. retain their number only but not gender, as खलतिकंवनानि 'mountain forests, i.e. forests in the vicinity of mountains.' Here खलतिकं is singular and वनानि plural, but the gender of both is the same viz. neuter.",
    "12052": "When a _Taddhita_ is _luped_, the adjectives which qualify such secondary derivatives agree with them in number and gender. This is a rule of syntax. Thus पंचालाः रमणीयाः बह्वन्नाः, बहुक्षीरघृताः बहुमाल्यफलाः 'the pleasant _Panchalas_ having plenty of food, plenty of milk and butter.' Here the adjective रमणीयाः, pleasant &c., agrees in number and gender with the _Panchalah_; being also in masculine plural. But when such a derivative is used as a _jati_ word then the adjective does not agree in number and gender, as पंचालाः जनपदः, गोदौ ग्रामः. Here जनपद though qualifying _Panchala_ does not agree with it in number and gender, as it is a noun of class. All attributes of such words formed by the _lup_ of _Taddhita_ agree with their substantives in number and gender: provided that such an attribute is not a common noun used as an adjective. Similarly adjectives which do not directly qualify such _Taddhita_-formed nouns, but do so through the medium of a noun of class, do not agree in gender and number with the _Taddhita_-word. Thus पंचालाः जनपदो रमणीयो बह्वन्नः, 'the country of _Panchalas_ is pleasant and fertile.' Here the words रमणीयः and बह्वन्नः qualify directly the word 'जनपदः' and indirectly the word _Panchalas_, and therefore do not agree with the latter.\n\nThe explanation of this _sutra_ as given by _Patanjali_ in the _Mahabhashya_ is somewhat different from that of the _Kasika_. The phrase चाजातेः is analysed by him as च and आजातेः, the sense being \"and as far as the _jati_ goes.\" The word _jati_ is thus explained :-\n\nA word expressing whatever is distinguishable by its form or figure, or which begins the name of an individual is easily found applicable to others without any further teaching, (a common name) provided it is not a word used in all genders, (common noun मुख्यजाति genus); and (only for the purpose of grammar as coming under the rules relating to the above mentioned words), a word expressing descendants by their parentage as well as a word expressing a person by the branch of the _Vedas_ (शाखा) which the family to which the person belongs is competent to read शाखाध्येतृ (_sakhadhyetri_) (गौणजाति) = जातिवाचकाः (_jativachakah_) आकृति गृहणज्जातिर्लिंगानां च नसर्वभाक् ।  सकृदाख्यात निग्राह्य गोत्रं च चरणैः सह ॥\n\nThe following examples will illustrate the meaning of the above definition:-(1) तट is a _jati_ word because it denotes what is distinguishable by its form, i. e. by its being contiguous to a place covered with water, (2) शूद्र is such a word, because when given as the name of an individual, is applicable to other _sudras_ (common name), (3) औपगव is such a word, and (4) कठ a person belonging to the family competent to read the branch of the _Vedas_ called _katha_ is also such a word. But देवदत्त is not such a word, because it is a proper name applicable to only one individual and शुक्ल is likewise not such a word, because it, though a common name, is used in all genders.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of nouns formed by the लुप् elision of an affix relating to man. Thus the _Taddhita_ affix कन् (क) is employed in denoting representation by imitation. Thus अश्वकः means a figure like a horse (in wood or clay or paper). But when the imitation is that of a man, this affix is elided. Thus चंचा means a \"doll of straw.\" But when we want to say a doll in the figure of a man, we will have चंचा + कन्लुप् (लुम्मनुष्ये (V. 3. 98)) = चञ्चा. Here this word is formed by the elision of an affix relating to man. Adjectives qualifying this word will not agree in gender and number. Thus चंचा अभिरूपः 'the delightful straw figure of man.' वध्रिकाः दर्शनीयः 'a beautiful representation of an eunuch.'",
    "12053": "The agreement between the number and gender of the nouns and attributes; of primary and secondary words formed by suffix rejection, is not an approved syntax. The gender and number of particular derivatives or adjectives are not blindly to be fixed by the primary words or the governed substantives; but it is a matter more or less of usage or idiom: and no hard and fast rule can be laid down for it. Thus the word दाराः 'wife' has the form of masculine plural, but is always applied to females, similarly आपः 'water' is always feminine plural in form, so also गृहाः वर्षाः सिकताः. This _sutra_, therefore, modifies the former _sutras_ and leaves the whole question of syntactic agreement to be decided by usage and idiom.\n\nThe words like _Panchalas_, _Kaurava_, &c, should not be considered as derivative words formed by the _lup_ elision of _Taddhita_; but they must be taken as proper nouns and appellatives of certain countries; consequently the gender and number of such words are fixed by the nature of such words and not by any rule of grammar.",
    "12054": "In explaining certain words, it is a round-about way of going to work to say that there was a suffix after them, which has been rejected, without producing any effect. It is easier to say that the form is what we find it to be, and that its peculiar meaning depends upon usage. Moreover, in many cases, the would-be etymological meaning is not in fact that the current meaning which the word has in ordinary language. It is therefore a useless circumlocution to presuppose the existence of a suffix, to add it to a word, and, then after all, to make it vanish.\n\nThus वरणाः _Varanah_ is the name of a city. To say that it is derived from वरणाः a kind of tree, because the city is situated near such trees, and the trees gave the name to the city, is a cumbersome process. Because there might be no trees वरणा at all near the town _Varana_. Let us therefore call words like वरणा, पञ्चाला, &c., as simply proper nouns. Therefore there is no occasion for the application of the _Taddhita_ affixes given in (IV. 2. 69) and (IV. 2. 70) (तस्य निवासः, अदूरभवञ्च) relating to residence and vicinity; much less of rules relating to '_lup_' elision contained in (IV. 2. 81) and (IV. 2. 82). (जनपदेलुप्, वरणादिभ्यश्च).",
    "12055": "This _sutra_ strengthens the former _sutra_. If it be said that a word always retains its etymological meaning in current language; then when there is an absence of such etymological meaning, then the word itself ought to vanish. But we know, as a matter of fact, that, there are words which have altogether lost their etymological sense, and connote a thing different from their radical meaning. Therefore to explain such words by _lup_ elision of affixes is improper, because they do not retain the meaning of their primitive words.\n\nIt has already been said that words like पंचालाः &c. are not derivative words, &c. but are appellatives. If these words be taken as proving their etymological meaning, that is, as expressing or dependent upon, the sense of the original word, then when there is a loss of the original word signification, the secondary word must also cease to be employed. Thus if _Panchalas_ be the name of the country in which the _Kshatryas_ called _Panchalas_ live, then when they cease to live in this country, it should cease to be called _Panchalas_. But we know, as a matter of fact, these words are now used without any reference to the people who once inhabited the countries. These words are consequently not derivative, but their sense is determined by usage. They are what may be called रूढि words.",
    "12056": "This _sutra_ may be divided into two parts. The first part stating the proposition and ending with the word _vachanam_. The second part giving the reason. The first part consists of four words; _Pradhana_: 'Principal in a compound.' As in the compound राजपुरुषः 'king's man,' the word _raja_ is _Upasarjana_; and पुरुषः is _pradhana_. 2. _Pratyaya_: 'affix.' 3. 'meaning.' 4. वचनम् 'word or sentence.'\n\nIn the time of _Panini_, there were some grammarians who held the opinion, that the meaning of a word is determined, if a compound word, then by its principal word; and if a derivative word, then by the suffix. _Panini_ controverts this opinion by declaring that in as much as the meaning of a word is fixed by usage and idiom, therefore the proofs for the meaning of a word are not to be searched either in the affixes which go to form it; or by its principal word, if it is a compound. Because, says _Panini_, the proof of the meaning of a word is in something else, that is to say in the usage of a people and not in the suffixes, &c. A person who has never heard the name of grammar, understands full well when told to bring a _Raja_-_purusha_. He brings an official and not a king, nor even any person in general. Similarly when told to bring an औपगव he brings a cowherd's child, not a cowherd, nor a child in general, nor both. When, therefore, the sense of a word is determined by usage, there is no use to strive to find out the sense by grammatical rules.",
    "12057": "Here _Panini_ controverts the opinion of those grammarians who would even define time and sequence. Thus there were authors who defined pluperfect as a tense relating to time hundred years past, others said a thousand years past, &c. _Panini_ declares that these are redundant definitions and reprehensible, for the same reason as given in the previous _sutra_.\n\nTo give another example. Thus अद्यतनः कालः or the period of the current day, has been thus defined by some _Acharyas_:- \"The period of time beginning from the point when one rises (or ought to rise) from his bed, according to the law, and ending with the point when one goes to bed, according to rule, is called _adyatana_.\" Others say \"from midnight to midnight is the period of the current day.\" Similarly others have explained the '_upasarjana_' to mean \"that which is not the principal word in a compound is called _upasarjana_.\" The sage _Panini_ has not thought it worth his while to define such word as _upasarjana_, in as much as their sense is well understood by all as a matter of usage. Thus common people who have never heard of grammar, also know the correct use of tenses; they say: \"This is to be done by me to-day, this wiil be done by us to-morrow, this was done by us yesterday.\"\n\nSimilarly common people also know the use of the word _upasarjana_, for they say:- \"वयमत्र गृहे ग्रामे वा उपसर्जनम्\" 'we are secondary or unimportant persons in this house or village,' meaning that they are not the principal persons. Therefore that which is valid according to the usage of the people is needless to be taught.\n\nWhy was not this _sutra_ included in the last? What is the necessity of making a separate rule of this? The answer is that it is an illustrative _sutra_, and does not exhaust the subject. There are other rules made by former sages which are also not taught by _Panini_. Thus the following rules of old _Rishis_ are not taught herein, they being supposed to be well-known. \"A _Bahuvrihi_ compound connotes ownership.\" \"In _Dvanda_ compounds the sense of both the members of a compound are principal\" \"In _Avyayibhava_ compounds the sense of the prior word is the principal\" &c.",
    "12058": "The words of this _sutra_ require some detailed explanation. The name of a _jati_ or species, always denotes one, since it is a collective noun, and will naturally take the singular number; by the present _sutra_ such words may take the plural number also. In such nouns of class, the plural number has also the force of the singular. The _anuvritti_ of _asishyam_ does not go further.\n\nIt follows from this that adjectives which are not themselves common noun, such as संपन्नः &c., agree with the noun and will also get the plural number. Thus संपन्नो यवः or संपन्ना यवाः; \"Full grown barley\" पूर्ववया ब्राह्मणः प्रत्युत्येयः or पूर्ववयसो ब्राह्मणाः प्रत्युत्येयाः ॥ Why have we used the word _jati_ in this _sutra_ ? For this aphorism does not apply to Proper Nouns. Thus देवदत्तः _Devadatta_, यज्ञदत्तः _Yajnadatta_.\n\nWhy have we used the word आख्यायाम्? A word may be a class noun or _jati_, but it may not be the appellation of a class. Thus the statue of _Kasyapa_ may also be called _kasyapa_; this is a class noun; but as it is not the appellation आख्या or name of a class, such words cannot take the plural form and still denote a singular sense.\n\nWhy do we say '_ekasmin_'? When two or more class names are compounded as ब्रीहियवौ 'the rice and barley': the rule does not apply.\n\nVart:- An exception must be made when a class noun is qualified by a numeral adjective. As एको ब्रीहिः संपन्नः सुभिक्षं करोति.",
    "12059": "Thus \"I speak\" or \"we speak\" (अहं ब्रवीमि or वयं बुमः), may be spoken by one person; similarly two persons may either use the dual case or the plural case; thus आवां ब्रूवः 'we two speak' or वयं ब्रूमः 'we speak.'\n\nVart:- There is prohibition when the pronoun of the Ist person is qualified by an attribute :- as अहं देवदत्तो ब्रवीमि, 'I _Devadatta_ am speaking.' अहं गार्ग्यो ब्रवीमि, 'I _Gargya_ am saying.' Here we cannot use the plural.\n\nVart:- The word गुरु 'master' may have plural form though referring to one person, when following the word युष्मद्; as त्वं मे गुरुः or यूयं मे गुरवः, 'Thou art my master,' or 'you are my master.'",
    "12060": "The word च in this aphorism draws in the _anuvritti_ of the word द्वयः from the last. Of the stars _phalguni_ and _proshthapada_, the forms may be either dual or plural. As उदिते पूर्वे फल्गुन्यौ (dual); or उदिताः पूर्वाः फल्गुन्यः (plural.) So also पूर्वे प्रोष्ठपदे or पूर्वाः प्रोष्ठपदः ॥  There are two pairs of stars of the name of _phalguni_ and _proshthapada_, both being of feminine gender, and their logical number being 'dual.' The present _sutra_ ordains plural optionally. If _phalguni_ and _proshthapada_ are not names of asterisms, they must have their proper number : as फल्गुन्यौ माणविके ॥",
    "12061": "In the Vedas, the star _punarvasu_ which is always dual in form, may be in the singular form and connote a dual meaning. As पुनर्वसुर्नक्षत्रं or पुनर्वसू नक्षत्रमदितिर्देवता ॥ The option is only allowed in the Vedas and not in secular literature. In the latter it must be in the dual, that is, पुनर्वसू ॥ Similarly when it is not the appellation of an asterism but of a man, there is no option. As पुनर्वसू माणवकौ.",
    "12062": "The word विशाखा is in the dual number as a rule. In the Vedas, it is found sometime to have the singular form, denoting duality. Thus विशाखा नक्षत्रम् or विशाखे नक्षत्रमिन्द्राग्नी देवता ॥",
    "12063": "When there is a collective compounding of the words _Tishya_ and _Punarvasu_ (meaning two groups of stars), the final compound is always in the dual. Thus उदितौ तिष्यपुनर्वसूदृश्येते 'the _Tishya_ and _Punarvasu_ having risen are seen (dual).'\n\nThere is one star called _Tishya_; and there are two stars called _Punarvasu_. As the _Dvandva_ compound of these stars refers to more than two stars, it ought to have been in the plural number. This rule teaches that there should be a dual number, where otherwise there would have been a plural number. Why do we say '_Tishya_' and '_Punarvasu_'? Observe विशाखानुराधाः 'the stars _Visakha_ and _Anuradha_.' The compound is in plural number.\n\nThis rule would not apply if these words do not connote stars but are used in any other sense. As तिष्यपुनर्वसवो माणवकाः, 'Boys called _Tishya_ and _Punarvasus_.'\n\nWhy is the word 'star' repeated in the _sutra_, when the previous _sutras_ and the context show that stars were being treated of. The repetition is for the sake of including the synonyms of _Tishya_ and _Punarvasu_. As तिष्यपुनर्वसू; पुष्यपुनर्वसू, सिद्धपुनर्वसू ॥\n\nThe rule only applies when these words form a _Dvandva_ compound, and not when they are compounded in any other way. Thus तिष्यपुनर्वसवः is an example of _Bahuvrihi_ compound meaning \"persons who confound the _Tishya_ with the _Punarvasu_.\"\n\nThe rule only applies to the plural _Dvandva_. If the _Dvandva_ takes the singular termination, this rule has no application. As तिष्यपुनर्वसू इदमिति.\n\nThis _sutra_ indicates by implication (_jnapaka_) that \"every _Dvandva_ compound may optionally take the terminations of the singular\" for otherwise the employment of the term बहुवचनस्य in the _sutra_ would be superfluous.\n\nThe word 'always' has been used in the text to show that the governing power of \"option\" stops here with this _sutra_ and does not extend to it or any further.",
    "12064": "This is a very important _sutra_, and deals with what is technically called _Ekasesha_ (or retention of one). When there are two or more words of the same form, and the same case termination, standing together, one is retained and the rest are dropped. Thus वृक्षः + वृक्षः = वृक्षौ (trees, in dual) वृक्षः + वृक्षः + वृक्षः = वृक्षाः.\n\nEvery individual thing requires an individual word to express it; one word therefore could not express many things; to prevent the repetition of the same word to express many objects of similar form, is the purpose of this _sutra_, by which one word is only retained.\n\nThis applies only to words having the same form and not if they have different forms; as प्लक्ष न्यग्रौधाः the _plaksha_ and _nyagrodha_ trees.\n\nThe word \"form\" is used in the text to show that even if two words have different meanings, but the same form, the rule of _Ekasesha_ will apply, as अक्षः (die) + अक्ष (eye) + अक्षः (axle) = अक्षाः. Similarly पादाः and भाषाः.\n\nThe present rule only applies to the retention of one, and prevents the retention of two or more.\n\nThe word शेष (retention) is used to show that there is not a substitution (_adesa_) of one for many, but the retention of one out of many.\n \nThe rule will not apply if the two words are in different case-terminations, though they may have the same form. As पयः (1. s.) पयो (2. s.) जरयति ब्राह्मणाभ्यां (3 d.) च कृतं ब्राह्मणाभ्यां (4. d.) च देहि.",
    "12065": "The word _sesha_ of the previous _sutra_ is understood here. The word \"_yuna_\" in the text is in the instrumental case. The _yuvan_ word is dropped when read along with a _Vriddha_ word. The word _Vriddha_ means _gotra_: the old _acharyas_ (grammarians) used the word _Vriddha_ for _gotra_. The _vriddha_ (or in other words, the gotra) word designates a person between whom and original head of the family a son (or a word formed by an _apatya_ affix) intervenes. In using together two words, one formed by a _gotra_ affix and the other by a _yuvan_ affix, the _Vriddha_ is retained, where the difference between those words is in their affixes only. These two words, _gotra_ and _yuvan_, are defined in _sutras_ (IV. 1. 162) and (IV. 1. 163). (अपत्यं पौत्रप्रभृति गोत्रम् ॥ जीवति तु वंश्ये युवा) ॥ Roughly speaking a _gotra_ word is formed from the original noun which is the name of the head of the family when a son of such person is living; and a _vriddha_ word represents thus a grandson, or lower than that, but not a son; while a _yuvan_ word is derived from such last mentioned _gotra_ word by another affix and thus represents persons lower than grandsons.\n\nThe word '_tad_' in the _sutra_ refers to the _gotra_ and _yuvan_ affixes. The word _lakshana_ 'sign' in the _sutra_ is synonymous with 'cause' or 'occasion'; meaning the specific difference is caused or occasioned by the _gotra_ and _yuvan_ affixes. The word चेत् in the _sutra_ means 'if.' The word एव 'only' is used to exclude others. The word विशेषः in the _sutra_ means the 'dissimilarity of form.'\n\nThus गार्ग्यः + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here the first word denotes a clan called _Gargya_ (the offspring or grandsons of _Garga_ formed by the affix यञ् (IV. I. 105) \\[1\\] the second word denotes a younger branch of the same, and is formed by the _Taddhita_ affix denoting a secondary derivative \\[2\\]. In this then, the first or \"_Vriddha_\" remains; the second or the _yuvan_ is dropped; and the form \"_Gargyau_\" means both the old and the new clan. Similarly वात्स्यः + वात्स्यायनः = वात्स्यौ ॥\n\nThis _Ekasesha_ is to be done only in those cases, where the two words have the same radical form, the only difference between them being in their derivative formation.\n\nThe words must differ only by their affixes, but their radical element must be the same. The rule therefore does not apply to:- गार्ग्यः (a _Vriddha_ word + वात्स्यायनः (a _yuvan_ word) = गार्ग्यवात्स्यायनौ ॥\n\nThis rule of _ekasesha_ does not apply if one of the words be not a _Vriddha_ word. Thus गर्गः + गार्ग्यायणः = गर्गगार्ग्यायणौ ॥\n\nSimilarly vice versa गार्ग्यः + गर्गः = गार्ग्यगर्गौ । Here the one word is _Vriddha_, but the other is not _yuvan_.\n\nThe word \"only\" is used in the _sutra_ in an exclusive sense, the force being, that two words may stand in the relation of _Vriddha_ and _yuvan_, their radical element, i.e. form may be the same; but if the secondary word has another sense over and above the sense of a _yuvan_ affix, this rule is not applicable. Thus rule (IV. 1. 148) \\[3\\] says a \"_Vriddha_ word may optionally take the affix ठक् to form a _yuvan_ word and to indicate contempt and born in the country of _Sauvira_.\" Thus भागवित्तिः + भागवित्तिकः = भागवित्तिभागवित्तिकौ. Here the second word, though a _yuvan_ word, connotes the additional sense of contempt and degradation. The affix ठक् is not merely a _yuvan_ affix but conveys the other sense also, the pure _yuvan_ word being भागवित्तायनः.\n\nN. B.- The system of domestic economy among the ancient _Aryas_ was considerably difterent from the prevalent one. The surnames or the _gotras_ represented the patriarchal system. Three forms of surnames are constantly met with in ancient literature. The first was most important: it was the patronymic by which the lord of the united family, the patriarch, was known. For example, _Garga_ or _Gargacharya_ was the recognised head of all the _Gargas_ who may be a hundred. His eldest son and heir was called _Gargi_. This is the first form of the patronymic (_apatya_). The grandsons or sons of _Gargi_ were named _Gargyas_ (_Vriddham_ or _Gotra_). On the decease of the old patriarch, _Gargi_ began to be called _Garga_; and the eldest of the grandsons was called _Gargi_; and those great-grandsons who belonged to the family, and were designated _Gargayanas_ (_yuvan_) were now called _Gargyas_.\n\n## Footnotes\n- [1] - गर्गादिभ्यो यञ् ॥\n- [2] - यञिञोश्च ॥\n- [3] – वृद्धाट्ठक्सौवीरेषु बहुलम् ॥",
    "12066": "When a word denoting _gotra_ and in the feminine gender is compounded with another word denoting a _yuvan_, the first is retained and the last is dropped; and the feminine noun so remaining is then treated like the masculine. This aphorism makes an addition to the previous _sutra_ and is governed by all the conditions mentioned in that _sutra_. Thus गर्गी + गार्ग्यायणः = गार्ग्यौ. Here note that the resultant form is the same as in the former _sutra_, namely the masculine.\n\nSimilarly दाक्षी + दाक्षायणः = दाक्षी (masculine dual of दाक्षि).\n\nVart:- The word _stri_ in the _sutra_ means _Vriddha_ _stri_, that is the eldest daughter of a grandson, or a further descendant considered as the female head of the family. The words '_tal_ _lakshanas_ _chedeva_ _viseshah_' of the previous _sutra_ govern this _sutra_ also, i.e. the distinction between the two words must be in their formative element and not in any thing else.",
    "12067": "When two words of different genders differ only in their derivative elements but not in their radical elements, that is to say, one is masculine and the other feminine because of certain affixes, the masculine only is retained and the feminine is dropped.\n\nThe governing force of the words '_vriddha_' and '_yuvan_,' of _sutra_ (I. 2. 65), does not extend to this _sutra_, but the remaining portion of _sutra_ (I. 2. 65) is to be read into this _sutra_. When a masculine word is read along with a feminine word, the feminine word is dropped and the masculine is retained, when the difference between the two words is caused only by the feminine and masculine affixes: as ब्राह्मणः + ब्राह्मणी = ब्राह्मणौ 'the _Brahmana_ and the _Brahmani_'; कुक्कुटः + कुक्कुटी = कुक्कुटौ. 'the cock and hen.'\n\nBut not so in the following:- कुक्कुटः + मयूरी कुक्कुटमयूर्यौ 'the cock and the peahen.' Similarly गणकः + गणकी = गणकगणक्यौ. Here the feminine affix ङीष्, by which the word _ganaki_ is formed from _ganaka_, in addition to its feminine signification, has the further signification given to it by Rule (IV. 1. 48), पुंयोगादाख्ययाम्, meaning the \"wife of\" a _ganaka_ and not a feminine _ganaka_; so also इन्द्रश्च इन्द्राणी चेन्द्रेन्द्राग्यौ ॥ Similarly आर्य्यः + आर्या = आर्यौ but आर्यः + आर्याणी = आर्यार्याण्यौ. Because the feminine affix in _aryani_ conveys more than its feminine signification. See Rule (IV. 1. 49).\n\nThis rule does not, of course, apply when it is not a masculine noun which is compounded, but it is a noun without any gender or neuter noun which is compounded with a feminine noun. Therefore प्राक् + प्राची = प्राक्प्राच्यौ. The word प्राक् is an indeclinable and is without any gender.",
    "12068": "With this _sutra_ ceases the governing force of the remaining conditions contained in _sutra_ (I. 2. 65). Even where the radical elements of two words are different there may be an _ekasesha_ under special circumstances. Thus भ्रातृ + स्वसृ = भ्रातरौ (brother and sister or brothers). Similarly पुत्र + दुहितृ = पुत्रौ, (son and daughter or sons).\n\nN. B.- The practical application of this _sutra_ is very neatly illustrated by the following example. There is a verse in _Yajyanvalkya_ _smriti_ पत्नी दुहितरश्श्चैव पितरौ भ्रातरस्तथा which declares that on the death of a sonless person his property passes to his wife, daughters, parents and _bhratarah_.\n\nHere the word _bhratarah_, if it be taken as simply the plural of _bhratri_, it means \"brothers\" and excludes sisters. But if it be interpreted according to this _sutra_, it means \"brothers and sisters\"; and thus gives sisters a right to inherit property of their brothers.",
    "12069": "A neuter prevails over a masculine or feminine noun when spoken of along with them, provided that the words differ in gender signs only; but radically they be the same. Thus आलस्यो मैथुनं निद्रा सेव्यमानं विवर्द्धते 'Idleness, lust, and sleep, indulged in, increase.' Here the adjective '_sevyyamanam_' is in the neuter gender, though it qualifies the words '_alasya_' which is in the masculine, '_maithunam_' which is in the neuter, and '_nidra_' which is in the feminine gender. The rule, therefore, may be stated in these words, that where one adjective qualifies several nouns, in different genders, but one of which must be neuter, the adjective agrees with the neuter.\n\nThe above illustration also shows that the neuter _ekasesha_ may be in the singular number.\n\nIf the neuter is compounded with another neuter, this rule does not apply. Thus शुक्लं + शुक्लं + शुक्लं = शुक्लानि; the word is in the plural; there is no _ekavadbhava_.\n\nThe words तल्लक्षणश्चेदेव विशेषः of _sutra_ (I. 2. 65) governs this _sutra_ also: thus शुक्लश्च कम्बलः, शुक्ला च वृहतिका, शुक्लं च वस्त्रं. \"The white (masc.) blanket, the white (fem) wrapper, and the white (neut.) garment,\" may all he spoken of collectively as शुक्लं (neut.).",
    "12070": "Thus पिता + माता = पितरौ 'father and mother, or parents' or मातापितरौ. The verse quoted under _sutra_ (I. 2. 68) illustrates this _sutra_ also. There the word _pitarau_' has been explained by all commentators as \"father and mother.\" The word \"_ekavad_\" of the last _sutra_ does not govern this _sutra_; though the _anuvritti_ of 'optionally' is to be read into this.",
    "12071": "Thus श्वशुरः + श्वश्रू may be either श्वशुरौ 'father-in-law and mother in-law,' or श्वश्रश्वशुरौ ॥",
    "12072": "The list of '_tyadadi_' pronouns has been given under _sutra_ (I. 1. 27). They are 12 words beginning with '_tyad_' and ending with '_kim_;' when these _tyadadi_ pronouns are compounded with any other noun, (or a pronoun, which does not belong to their class), they prevail, the rest are dropped. The word '_sarva_' is used in the aphorism to indicate 'universality'; i. e. what ever may be the word in composition with them, the '_tyad_ &c.' are retained to the exclusion of others. The word '_nitya_' is used to indicate that this is an obligatory rule, and not optional, as were the last rules.\n\nThus सः (he) + देवदत्तः (_Devadatta_) = तौ (they two).\n\nVart:- When त्यदादि words are compounded among themselves, the word which is read last in the order given in the _Ganapatha_ remains, the rest are dropped. Thus यः + सः = यौ; यः + कः = कौ ॥ Thus यद् is read after तद् (see (I. 1, 27)). So यद् will be retained and not तद्. Similarly किम् is read after यद्, and therefore किम् is retained to the exclusion of यद्.",
    "12073": "As a general rule, when there is a compounding of masculine and feminine nouns, the masculine noun is retained (see (I. 2. 67)). The present _sutra_ is an exception to that rule. It ordains that when there is a compounding of words denoting group of domestic animals, of different genders, the feminine noun is preferred; provided that the words should not relate to the young of such animals. The word '_ataruna_' in the aphorism qualifies the word '_pasu_' with which it is in construction, and not the word '_sangha_.' As गाव इमाः 'these cows (and bulls);' अजा इमाः 'these goats' (both males and females).\n\nThe rule only applies to domestic (_gramya_) animals and not to wild animals; and only to beasts (_pasu_) and not men. As रुरव इमे, 'these wild deers' (male and female); पृषता इमे, 'these antelopes' (male and female); ब्राह्मणाः, 'the _Brahmanas_ (male and female); क्षत्रियाः, 'the _Kshatriyas_.' In all these the masculine noun is retained by Rule (I. 2. 67).\n\nVart:- This rule must be confined to domestic animals having divided hoof. Therefore अश्वा इमे, 'these horses' (male and female). Here the masculine noun is retained, because horse has no divided hoof.\n\nWhy have we used the word (_sangha_) \"collection\"? Observe एतौ गावौ चरतः, 'these two cows are grazing.' Here the word '_gavau_' does not connote 'bull' also.\n\nWhy do we say \"not being young?\" वत्सा इमे 'these calves'; बर्करा इमे 'these kids.' Here the masculine noun is retained by the application of Rule (I. 2. 67).",
    "13001": "This defines the word _dhatu_ or root. The list of Sanskrit verbs begins with the root _bhu_ 'to be.' Sanskrit grammarians have divided all verbs into ten classes, according to certain modifications which their roots undergo before certain terminations. The ten classes are as follows:-\n\n1. _Bhu_ class. 2. _Ad_. 3. _Hu_. 4. _Div_. 5. _Su_, 6. _Tud_. 7. _Rudh_. 8. _Tan_. 9. _Kri_. 10. _Chur_.\n\nThere are about two thousand verbs, and they are conjugated in two forms, some taking the _Parasmaipada_ terminations only, the others the _Atmanepada_ terminations and some both. The present chapter deals mostly with rules determining the nature of the verbal root, whether it is _Parasmaipadi_ or _Atmanepadi_ or both. A verb expresses action. The word _dhatu_ is a word coined by older grammarians than _Panini_ and they employed the term in denoting a word expressing action. Here also, therefore, the word _dhatu_ means a word which expresses action.\n\nThe वा in the _sutra_ is for the sake of auspiciousness; for the regular _sandhi_ of भू + आदि is भ्वादि and not भूवादि; while Dr. Ballantyne considers that वा is a separate root : he translates the _sutra_ thus:- \"Let the verbal roots _bhu_ 'be,' _va_ 'blow' and the like be called _dhatu_.\"",
    "13002": "_Anunasika_ or nasalized vowels are इत् that is indicatory, when occurring in technical words. Thus in क्विन्, विद्, विच् the _anunasika_ इ is इत्. The original _sutra_ contains the word '_upadesa_' which we have translated as technical term. '_Upadesa_' literally means 'instruction' or the first mentioning of a thing either in a _sutrapatha_, or _ganapatha_, or _dhatu_ _patha_, &c.\n\nFrom this _sutra_ up to _sutra_ (I. 3. 9), there is a description of servile or indicatory letters called इत्. \"In _Panini_'s Grammar there is no visible sign of the nasality of a vowel -- hence we can know a vowel to be nasalized only from _Panini_'s explicitly asserting that it is so, or from our finding that he treats it in such a way that we must conclude he regarded it as nasal.\" An _upadesa_ is defined as signifying an original enunciation, that is to say, an affix (_pratyaya_), or an augment (_agama_), or a verbal root (_dhatu_), or in short, any form of expression which occurs only in technical treatises of grammar, and which is not a word ready for use, but one of the supposed original elements of a word. Thus in the root एध 'to increase,' the final अ is indicatory, the real root is एध्. So also the final अ of स्पर्द्ध is इत् ॥\n\nIf the word is not an _upadesa_, then the nasal vowel is not इत् ॥ As अभ्र आं अपः ॥ A word may be an _upadesa_, and nasal, but if it is not a vowel, it need not be इत् as the affix मनिन् in _sutra_ (III. 2. 74). (आतो मनिन् क्वनिब् वनिपश्च) It is only the nasal vowel of an _upadesa_ that becomes इत् and not all the vowels. The word इत् occurs in _sutras_ (V. 2. 16). (आदितश्च &c.).",
    "13003": "All the final consonants of roots, affixes, &c., are indicatory. As in the _pratyahara_ _sutras_ अ इ उ ण्; here ण् is इत् ॥ ऋ लृ क्; here क् is इत् ॥ ए ओड्; here ङ् is इत् ॥ ऐ औच्; here च् is इत् ॥ It is only in _upadesa_, that a final consonant is इत्. Not therefore, in अग्निचित् or सोमसुत्, which are complete words.",
    "13004": "This is an exception to the previous _sutra_ which declared all final consonants to be इत्. In case terminations, the final त्, थ्, द्, ध्, न्, स्, and म्, are not इत्. Thus the case termination of nominative plural is जस्. Here the final स्, though a consonant is not an इत्; and is not rejected, as in ब्राह्मणाः ॥ The word तु in the _sutra_ means the letters of the class त by virtue of _sutra_ 69 Chapter I. (see _ante_). The word _vibhakti_ will be defined later on in _sutra_ (I. 4. 104). These are terminations applied to nouns in declining them through various cases; and to verbs in conjugating them. Thus in _sutra_ (VII. 1. 12), (टाङसिङसामिनात्स्याः) the _vibhaktis_ इन्, आत् and स्य replace टा, ङसि and ङस्. Here the final त् of the affix आत् is not indicatory and hence not rejected, as वृक्षात्. Similarly verbal terminations तस् and थस् as पचतः, पचथः ॥ So also the final म् as ताम् and तम् in अपचताम् and अपचतम् ॥\n\nThis exception applies only to _vibhaktis_ and not to affixes in general. Thus the finals of यत् (III. 1. 97 अचोयत्;) युस् (V. 2. 123, ऊर्णाया युस्) and श्रम् (III. 1. 78 युधादिभ्य श्रम् ।) are इत् and are rejected. This exception, however, does not apply to the _vibhakti_ अत् (in (V. 3. 12) किमोऽत् or (III. 4. 106), इटोऽत्). In those two _sutras_ the final त् of the _vibhakti_ is इत्. The reason of this is, that the present _sutra_ is an _anitya_ _sutra_, i. e. a rule not of general application. In _sutra_ (V. 3. 24), (इदमस्थमुः) we find, 'the word इदम् takes the _vibhakti_ थमु in the sense of mode or manner.' As इद् + थमु = इत्थम्, 'in this manner.' Now थमु is a _vibhakti_ by (V. 3. 1). (प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिः), the उ is इत्, the real _vibhakti_ is थम्. Now had the present _sutra_ been of universal application, then there would have been no necessity of adding this उ as indicatory letter, which has been evidently added to save the म् of थम् from becoming an इत्. This _sutra_ is consequently an _antiya_ _sutra_.",
    "13005": "The syllables ञि, टु and डु, standing at the beginning of a root are indicatory; as ञिमिदा 'to have affectionate pleasure.' The real root is मिद्, the ञि is servile. So टुनदि 'to rejoice; be glad' the real root being नद्. So डुदाङ् 'to give' the real root being दा.\n\nThe ञि shows that the past participle क्त has the power of the present (III. 2. 187) (ञीतः क्तः). As ञिफला--फुल्लः 'blown'; ञिमिदा--भिन्नः; 'fat'; ञिधृषा—धृष्टः 'bold,' ञिक्ष्विदा—क्ष्विन्नः 'soft,' ञिइन्धी—इद्धः 'kindled.'\n\nThe टु subjoined to a root serves to show that it admits the affix अथु to form a noun indicative of the act (III. 3.89) ट्वितोऽथुच्)); as टुवेपृः—वेपथुः 'shaking'; टु ओश्वि--श्वयथुः 'swelling.'\n\nThe डु indicates that the root to which it is subjoined admits of the affix त्रिम (III. 3. 88), ड्वितः क्त्रिः) to form a noun or adjective attributive of the act by which the substantive thing has been produced, as डुकृञ्—कृत्रिमम् 'artificial' डुपचष्—पक्त्रिमम् 'ripe'; डुवप्—उप्त्रिमम् 'sown.'\n\nIf these three syllables do not stand in the beginning of a verb, they are not indicatory; as पटूयति, कण्डूयति, &c.",
    "13006": "The initial ष् of an affix gets the name of इत् and is rejected. Thus by Rule (III. 1. 145) (शिल्पिनि ष्वुन्) the affix ष्वुन् is added to a verb to indicate proficient in the art expressed by the verb. The ष् and न् are इत् and अक् takes the place of वु (VII. I.1), युवोरनाकौ). Thus नृत् + ष्वुन् = नर्त् + अक् = नर्तकः 'a dancer' (by profession); fem. नर्तकी (IV. 1. 41), षिद्गौरादिभ्यश्च 'words formed by affixes having an indicatory ष् take the affix ङीष् in the feminine'): so also रजकः, fem. रजकी.\n\nThe initial ष् of an affix only is इत् and not every initial ष्. Thus not in षोडः 'six,' or षडिकः ॥ The ष् must be initial, therefore it is not इत् in the affix टिषच् in अविमह्योष्टिषच्, (_Un_ I. 45) as अविषः 'an ocean', महिषः 'a buffalo.'",
    "13007": "The consonants च्, छ्, ज्, झ्, ञ्, ट्, ठ्, ड्, ढ्, and ण्, are always इत् and are rejected when initial in affixes. The word 'affix' of the previous _sutra_ governs this also.\n\nAs the affix च्फञ् _chapan_ in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 98) गोत्रे कुञ्जादिभ्यश्चफञ्. Here च् is indicatory, as, कौञ्चायन्यः ॥ The initial छ् _chh_ of an affix is always replaced by ईय (VII. 1. 2) आयनेयीनीयियः फढ खच्छघां प्रत्ययादीनाम्). The initial ज् of an affix is इत्. As, जस् (Nom. Pl. term) ब्राह्मणाः ॥ The initial झ् of an affix is always replaced by अन्त, as भू + शप् + झि = भवन्ति ॥ (VII. 1. 3) झोऽन्तः). The initial ञ् of an affix is इत् as in ञ्य which comes after the words शण्डिक &c. As शाण्डिक्यः (IV. 3. 92) शण्डिकादिभ्योञ्यः). The indicatory ञ् causes _vriddhi_ by rules (VII. 2. 115), (VII. 2. 116) and (VII. 2. 117): (अचोञ्णिति, अतउपधायाः, तद्धितेष्वचामादेः).\n\nThe initial ट् _t_ of an affix is इत् as in (III. 2. 16) (चरेष्टः the root चर् takes the affix ट when compounded with a noun in the locative). As कुरुचरः 'who goes among the _Kurus_.' The feminines of words formed by this affix take ङीप् (IV. 1. 15) टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसज् &c.) As कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी. The initial ठ् of an affix is always replaced by इक (VII. 3. 50) ठस्येकः). The initial ड् of an office is _it_, as in (III. 2. 97) (सप्तम्यां जनेडः the root जन् takes the affix ड when in composition with a word in the locative, as उपसरजः, मन्दुरजः. The ड् indicates that the final of the word called टि should be elided when an affix having indicatory _d_ is added. The initial ढ् of an affix is replaced by एय (VII. 1. 2.)\n\nThe letter ण् is always an इत् when initial. As in the aphorism (IV. 4 85) (अन्नास्मः) the affix ण comes after the word अन्न 'food.' As अन्न + ण = आन्नः. The _n_ causes _Vriddhi_.\n\nThis _sutra_ could very well have been included in the last aphorism. Why has it then been made a separate aphorism? The reply is that the present _sutra_ declares an _anitya_ rule--that is to say, a rule which is not universally true. The initial palatal or lingual of every affix is not indicatory. Thus in the affixes चुञ्चुप् and चणप् the initial च् is not indicatory but forms part of the real affix. As विद्याचुंचुः विद्याचणः 'famous for one's learning.' See _Sutra_ (V. 2. 26). तेन वित्तश्चुञ्चुप् चणपौ. Similarly the initial ट of the affix टीटच् (V. 2. 31) अवात्कुटारच्च, नते नासिकायाः संज्ञायां टीटञ् नाटज्भ्रटचः), is not _it_. As अवटीटम् 'flat nosed.'\n\nOf course it is the initial palatal and lingual which are servile; if these letters occur in the middle of an affix, they will not be indicatory. As ठ of the affix अठच् is not indicatory in _sutra_ (V. 2. 35) (कर्मणि घटोऽठच्) कर्मठः 'dexterous.'",
    "13008": "The initial ल्, श्, क्, ख्, ग्, घ्, ङ्, of affixes are indicatory, except in _Taddhita_ affixes. Thus the initial ल् in ल्युट is इत् (III. 3. 115) ल्यट्च)। चि +ल्युट् = चयनम् (VII. I. 1) 'collecting.' The initial श् in शप् is इत् (III. 1. 68. कर्तरि शप्) भू + शप् + तिप् = भो + अ + ति = 'he is.' The initial क् is इत् as in क्त and क्तवतु (I. I. 26), as भुक्तः 'eating' भुक्तवान्. The initial ख् is इत् as in खच् (III. 2. 38) प्रियवशे वदः खच्) the word वद takes the affix _khach_ when compounded with प्रिय and वश्) प्रियंवदः 'speaking kindly'. वशंवदः 'submissive.' The initial ग् is इत् as in the affix ग्स्नु (III 2. 139) ग्लाजिस्थश्च ग्स्नु), ग्लास्नुः 'languid', जिष्णुः 'victorious,' स्थास्नुः 'unmoveable.' The initial घ् is इत् as in घुरच् (III. 2. 161) भञ्जभासभिदो घुरच्) भञ्ज + घुरच् = भङ्गुरम् 'brittle.' The initial ङ् is इत्, as in ङसि (termination of the ablative sing.) ङस् ditto of genitive sing. (IV. 1. 2), as सुमनस् + ङस् = सुमनस् + अस् = सुमनसः 'of a well minded.' In _Taddhitta_ affixes however, these initials ल्, श् and gutturals are not इत्; and are therefore not elided. Thus चूडा + लच् = चूडालः (V. 2. 96.) प्राणिस्थादातो लजन्यतरस्याम्). 'crested'; लोम + श = लोमशः (V. 2. 100) लोमादिपामादिपिच्छादिभ्यः शनेलच्) 'hairy;' वृक्ष + कन् = वृक्षकः (V. 3. 81) - (V. 3. 86) जातिनाम्नः कन्) 'a small tree.'",
    "13009": "This _sutra_ declares the function of इत्; namely it is a mere indicatory letter, and must be rejected. It is useful only as a mnemonic and is not a part of the term.\n\nThe word _tasya_ in the _sutra_ indicates that the substitution of _lopa_ must be in the place of the whole term called इत्, and not only in the place of the final letter, which last is the general rule (see. (I. 1. 52)). Therefore, the whole of ञि, टु  and डु is rejected and not only their finals.",
    "13010": "Thus _sutra_ (III. I 134) (नन्दिग्रहिपचादिभ्यो ल्युणिन्यचः) declares- 'the affixes ल्यु, णिनि and अच् are applied to नन्दि, ग्रहि and पच् class of words.' It means the affix ल्यु is applied to the words of नन्दि class, the affix णिनि to words of ग्रहि class, and अच् to words of पच् class. The application must be respectively according to order, and not hap-hazard. Similarly in (VI. 1 77) इको यणचि (if a vowel follows) in the place of इ, उ, ऋ, लृ there is यण् i. e., य्, र्, ल्, व् ॥ So also see _Sutra_. (IV. 3. 94) (तूदीशलातुरवर्मतीकूचवाराड् ढक् छण् ढञ् यकः) where the four affixes _dhak_, _chhan_ _dhan_, and _yak_ are applied respectively to the words _tudi_, _salatura_, _varmati_ and _kuchavara_; i.e., the first affix in the order of enumeration to the first word, the second affix to the second word, &c. As तौदेयः, शालातुरीयः, वार्मतेयः and कौचवार्य्यः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of equal members'? This rule will not apply if the number of substitutes and of things for which these are to be substituted are unequal. As in _sutra_ (1. 4. 90), लक्षणेत्थभूताख्यानभागवीप्सासु प्रति पर्यनवः for here the words _lakshana_, &c., in the first part of the _sutra_ are four in number, while the words _prati_ &c. are only three. That _sutra_ therefore must be read as thus. \"The words प्रति, परि and अनु are _karma_ _pravachaniya_, whenever they indicate either _lakshana_ (a mark), _itthambhuta_ _khyana_ (a statement of mere circumstance); _bhaga_ (division); or _vipsa_ (desire).\"",
    "13011": "When in this collection of grammatical _sutras_, there is any _sutra_ that has a circumflex accent, it denotes that it is either the beginning of a subject and the subsequent _sutras_ are governed by it, or that it ends a subject and separates the previous _sutras_ from the following.\n\nAs a rule, the _sutras_ are not marked with accents; it is therefore from commentaries that one has to learn whether a _sutra_ has a _svarita_ or not. Thus the following _sutras_ must evidently have _svarita_ as they are governing _sutras_; प्रत्ययः (III. I. 1.) धातोः (III. I. 91), अङ्गस्य (VI. 4. 1), भस्य (VI. 4. 129).",
    "13012": "The word '_atmanepada_' here governs all the subsequent _sutras_ up to _sutra_ (I. 3. 77) inclusive, and is understood in them all; and will not therefore be repeated. Thus of the verb आस the final अ is _anudatta_ and is इत्. It is therefore an _atmanepadi_ verb. As अस्ति. So षूङ्—सूते, शीङ् शेते.",
    "13013": "_Sutra_ (III. 4. 69) declares the \"letter ल (लट्, लिट् &c.,) is placed after transitive verbs in denoting the object also as well as the agent; and after intransitives in marking the condition (i.e., the action itself which the verb imports) also as well as the agent.\" The _Paras_. and _Atman_. affixes would have come, therefore, generally after all these verbs. The present _sutra_ restricts _Atman_. affixes to _bhava_ and _karma_ verbs.\n\nThis is clear. Impersonal verbs and passive verbs as a rule are conjugated in the _atmanepada_ and take the terminations of that _pada_. These originally were verbs expressive of states rather than of actions. As of भाव we have ग्लायते भवता 'you dislike' (lit. 'it is disliked by you'), सुप्यते भवता 'you sleep.' Similarly passive verbs as क्रियते कटः 'the mat is made'; ह्रियते भारः 'the load is carried.'\n\nAll verbs in Sanskrit may have three voices, viz, active, passive, and middle or impersonal; active voice is generally _parasmaipada_. The reflexive verbs known as कर्मकर्तरि are also _atmanepadi_. Thus लूयते केदारः स्वयमेव 'the wood cuts of itself.' See _sutra_ (I. 3. 78).",
    "13014": "The active or कर्तृवाच्य verbs when denoting reciprocal action are _atmanepadi_. As, व्यतिपचन्ते, 'they cook for each other,' व्यतिलुनते 'he performs cutting of wood which was the appropriate office of another.'\n\nThe words \"reciprocity or interchange of action\" of this _sutra_ govern and are understood in the two following _sutras_ also.\n\nThe word _karma_ in the _sutra_ means action and not the technical '_karma_' meaning 'object' and the word _vyatihara_ means reciprocity or interchange. When an action which was appropriate to one person is performed by another, whose duty it was not, that is called 'interchange of action.' When such interchange is not meant _Paras_. is used. As लुनन्ति 'they cut.' The word _kartari_ here is used for the sake of the subsequent aphorism (I. 3. 78), which see.",
    "13015": "This aphorism prohibits _Atmanepada_ affixes in certain cases where by force of the last _sutra_ _Atmanepada_ affixes would have been obtained. As व्यतिगच्छन्ति 'they go against each other,' व्यतिहिंसन्ति 'they injure each other.' व्यतिघ्नन्ति 'they fight together.'\n\nThe word 'not' of this _sutra_ is understood in the subsequent _sutra_.\n\nVart:- This prohibition extends to the verbs हस् 'to laugh,' and the rest. As व्यतिहसन्ति, व्यतिजल्पन्ति, व्यतिपठन्ति ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be made of the verbs हरति 'to injure,' as संप्रहरन्ते राजानः ॥",
    "13016": "Thus इतरेतरस्य व्यति लुनन्ति 'they cut each other' अन्योन्यस्य व्यतिलुनन्ति 'they cut one another.'\n\nVart:- This rule must also be applied when the word परस्पर is in composition with the verb, as an _upapada_. As परस्परस्य व्यतिलुनन्ति.",
    "13017": "As विशति 'he enters, but निविशते 'he enters in.'\n\nEven when the augment अट् of the imperfect, Aorist and Conditional tenses intervenes between the root and the preposition, terminations are of the _atmanepada_. As न्यविशत 'he entered in.'\n\nThe नि of the _sutra_ must be an _upasarga_, because that has a sense, and not any नि. On this there is this _paribhasha_:-अर्थवद्ग्रहणेनानर्थकस्य \"a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning.\" Thus in मधुनि विशन्ति भ्रमराः 'the beetles enter the honey flowers.\" Here the नि is a part of the word मधुनि and has no sense by itself, and therefore the verb is in the _Parasmaipada_ and not in the _Atmanepada_.",
    "13018": "The verb डुक्रीञ् 'to buy or barter,' has an indicatory ञ् and therefore, by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) it will be _Atmanepadi_ when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present _sutra_, therefore, refers to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nThe root क्री 'to buy' as a general rule takes the terminations of both _padas_, but when it is preceded by _pari_, _vi_, or _ava_, it is restricted to _Atmanepada_ terminations. As प्ररीक्रीणीते 'he buys'; विक्रीणीते 'he sells'; अवक्रीणीते 'he buys.'\n\nThe word _pari_, _vi_, and _ava_ must be _upasargas_, therefore, in the following example, there is no _Atmanepada_ termination, because the _vi_ there is not a preposition but a noun, as, बहुविक्रीणाति वनम्.",
    "13019": "As विजयते 'he conquers', पराजयते 'he conquers.' The words _vi_ and _para_ must be _upasargas_ (prepositions), for the application of this rule. In the following examples, they are used as substaintives बहुविजयति वनम्, पराजयति सेना ॥",
    "13020": "The root दा is generally both _Parasmaipadi_ and _Atmanepadi_ (see _Sutra_. 72). But when preceded by the preposition आ, it is restriced to the _atmanepada_ As विद्यामादत्ते 'he acquires knowledge.' But when it means \"to widen the mouth\" whether actually or metaphorically, it is _parasmaipadi_. As आस्यं व्याददाति. 'He expands his own mouth.'\n\nVart:- The prohibition also applies when the action is similar to the act of opening the mouth. As विपादिकां व्याददाति 'he opens the tumour.' कूलं व्याददाति नदी 'the river breaks the bank.'\n\nVart:- When the action does not affect the agents' own body the verb is _atmanepadi_, as व्याददतेपिपीलिकाः पतंगस्य मुखम्, 'the ants open the mouth of a locust.'",
    "13021": "The words \"आङ्\" is to be read into the _sutra_ by virtue of the conjunction च in the text. As आक्रीडते संक्रीडते अनुक्रीडते, or परिक्रीडते 'he plays.'\n\nVart:- When the verb क्रीड् compounded with सम् means 'to make a rattling or creaking noise,' it does not take _atmanepada_ terminations. As संक्रीडन्ति शकटानि 'the carts rattle or creak.' The word _anu_, _pari_ &c., being taught along with _sam_, indicates that the _upasargas_ _anu_, _pari_, &c., are to be taken and not the _karmapravachaniya_ _anu_ _pari_, &c. Therefore, when these prefixes are used as _karmapravachaniya_, they do not cause the verb क्रीड् to take the _atmanepada_ terminations as माणवकमनुक्रीडति 'he plays in imitation of the boy.' For the definition and action of _karmapravachaniya_, see. (I. 4. 83) and (II. 3. 8).\n\nVart:- The verb आगम् takes the _atmanepada_ terminations when meaning 'to wait for', 'to overlook', 'to have patience', as, आगमयस्व तावन् माणवकम् । 'Have patience with the boy.'\n\nVart:- The verb शिक्ष takes _atmanepada_ terminations, when meaning 'to enquire':- as, विद्यासु शिक्षते 'he investigates sciences.'\n\nVart:- The verb नाथ् when meaning 'to bless,' takes _atmanepada_ terminations, as, सर्पिषो नाथते 'he blesses with clarified butter.' मधुनो नाथते । Why do we say 'when meaning to bless'? Observe, माणवकमनुनाथति, 'he begs of _Manavaka_.'\n\nVart:- The verb हरति takes _atmanepada_ terminations when meaning 'to take after the nature of the parents.' As पैतृकमश्वा अनुहरते 'the horses resemble their father.' मातृकं गावोऽनुहरन्ते 'the cows always imitate their mother.' But when not having this meaning, we have मातुरनुहरति 'he resembles his mother.'\n\nVart:- The verb किरति takes _atmanepada_ terminations when meaning 'to scratch out or scatter with joy, for abode or food.' As अपस्किरते वृषभो हृष्टः 'the happy bull scratches with joy.' अपस्किरते कुक्कुटो भक्षार्थी 'the cock scratches in search of food,' अपस्किरते श्वाऽऽश्रयार्थी 'the dog scratches to make his abode.' When not having these senses we have अपकिरति कुसुमम् 'he scatters about the flowers.' The dental स in _apaskirate_ is added by _sutra_ (VI. 1. 142). अपाच्चतुष्पाच्छकुनिष्वालेखने ॥\n\nVart:- The verbs नु 'to cry' and प्रच्छ 'to ask' take the _atmanepada_ terminations when preceded by the preposition आङ्, as आनुते शृगालः 'the jackal howls,' आपृच्छते गुरुम् 'he questions the _Guru_.'\n\nVart:- The verb शप् when meaning 'to touch the body by the word' takes _atmanepada_ affixes. As देवदत्ताय शपते 'he promises by oath to _Devadatta_.' Otherwise we have शपति 'he curses.'",
    "13022": "As संतिष्ठते 'he stays with,' अवतिष्ठते 'he waits patiently,' प्रतिष्ठते 'he sets forth,' वितिष्ठते 'he stands apart.'\n\nVart:- The verb स्था when preceded by आङ् and meaning 'solemn declaration' takes _atmanepada_ terminations; as अस्ति संस्कारमात्रमातिष्ठते ॥ Or to take another example, जलं विशं वा तव कारणादास्थास्ये 'for thee I shall surely have recourse to water or poison.'",
    "13023": "The word _prakasana_ means disclosing one's intentions. The word _stheyakhya_ is a compound of _stheya_ 'arbitrator; and _akhya_ 'name.'\n\nAs तिष्ठते जायापत्ये 'the wife expresses her wish to the husband;' त्वयितिष्ठते 'he refers to thee for settlement;' संशय्य कर्णादिषु तिष्ठते यः, 'who, when he is in doubt, has recourse to _Karna_ as his judge or umpire.'",
    "13024": "The word '_karma_' in this aphorism means 'action,' and does not mean the grammatical _karma_ or 'object.'\n\nAs गेहे उत्तिष्ठते 'he strives for the house' so also कुटुम्बे उत्तिष्ठते ॥ But आसनादुत्तिष्ठति 'he rises up from the seat.'\n\nVart:- The force of the preposition _ut_ must be to express ईहा, 'effort, exertion, wish or desire, to surprise or excell.' If this be not the force of _ut_, the terminations are those of the _Parasmaipada_. As अस्माद् ग्रामात् शतमुत्तिष्ठति 'a hundred is yielded by this village.' The word ईहा qualifies the word '_anurdhakarmani_,' and does not debar the latter.",
    "13025": "As ऐन्द्र्यागार्हपत्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches with prayers or worships the _Garhapatya_ fire with _aindra_ hymns.'\n\nIf it does not mean 'praising with hymns' the terminations which the verb takes, are those of the _Parasmaipada_, as भर्तारमुपतिष्ठति यौवनेन 'she approaches the husband through youth.'\n\nVart:- The verb स्था after the preposition उप takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_ when meaning 'worshipping a deity,' 'to approach for intercourse or uniting or joining,' 'to form friendship with,' and 'to lead to as a way.' Thus:- 1st _Deva_ _puja_ आदित्यमुपतिष्ठते 'he worships the _Aditya_.' 2. _Sangati_ _karana_ पतिमुपतिष्ठते नारी 'the wife approaches the husband,' रथिकानुपतिष्ठते 'forms union with charioteers.' 3. _Mitri_ _karana_ सन्तमुपतिष्ठते साधुः 'the good man approaches the saints to make friends with.' What is the difference between _Sangati_-_karana_ and _Mitri_-_karana_ ? _Sangati_-_karana_ means drawing near and approaching together in space, as गंगायमुनामुपतिष्ठते 'the Ganges joins the _Jumna_.' While the friendly relations may be established without coming in physical contact. 4. _Patha_ :- अयं पन्थाः स्रुघ्नमुपतिष्ठते 'this road leads to _Srughna_.'\n\nVart:- It must be stated that the _Atmanepada_ is optional when the sense is 'desire of getting.' As भिक्षुको ब्राह्मणकुलमुपतिष्ठते or उपतिष्ठति 'a beggar waits at the place of a _Brahmana_ with the desire of getting something.'",
    "13026": "As भोजनकाले उपतिष्ठते 'he stands ready at the time of dinner,' यावदभुक्तमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever it is dinner time,' यावदोदनमुपतिष्ठते 'he is present whenever there is food, that is he comes at the time of dinner.' The word _bhukta_ is formed by adding the affix _kta_ to the root, and has the force of condition' here.\n\nThe phrase 'when used in the Intransitive' governs the three succeeding _sutras_ also.\n\nIf it is transitive; the verb _upastha_ takes the _parasmaipada_ terminations. As राजानमुपतिष्ठते 'he approaches the king.'",
    "13027": "As उत्तपते or वितपते विद्याया विद्यार्थी 'The scholar shines with knowledge.' But in transitive verbs, it is _Parasmaipadi_. As उत्तपति सुवर्णंसुवर्णकारः 'the goldsmith heats the gold,' वितपति पृष्ठं सविता 'the sun heats the back.'\n\nVart:- It must be stated that the terminations are of the _atmanepada_, though the verb _ut_-_tapa_ or _vi_-_tapa_ be transitive, when the object is some limb of one's own body. As उत्तपते पाणिम् or वितपते पाणिम् or पृष्ठम् 'he heats his own hand or back.' The word स्वाङ्ग means one's own body and not the _paribhashika_ or the technical स्वाङ्ग meaning \"a thing which not being liquid or gaseous and being capable of being perceived by the senses, and not being one produced by a change from the natural state, exists in a living being and though found elsewhere actually or at any particular time, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually (not figuratively) the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.\" (See (IV. 1. 54. स्वाङ्गाच्चोपसर्जनादसंयोगोपधात्). Therefore not so in the following देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य पृष्टमुत्तपति '_Devadatta_ heats the back of _Yajnadatta_.' When the preposition is other than _ut_ or _vi_, _parasmaipada_ affix is employed; as, निष्टपति.",
    "13028": "The word intransitive of _sutra_ (I. 3. 26) is understood here also. Both these verbs are generally _parasmaipadi_. When they take the affix आ they become _atmanepadi_. _Yam_ belongs to _Bhvadi_ class; and _han_ to _Adadi_ class. Thus आ + यम् + शप् + ते = आ + यच्छ + अते (VII. 3. 77) इषुगमियमां छः) '_chh_ is the substitute of the finals of _ish, _gam_ and _yam_, when an affix having an indicatory श् follows) = आयच्छते 'it spreads.' आयच्छेते and आयच्छन्ते; so also आ + हन् + ते = आ + ह + ते (I. 2. 4) and (VI. 4. 37) अनुदात्तोपदेशवनतितनोत्यादीनामनुनासिकलोपो झलिक्ङिति = आहते, 'he strikes.' आ = हन् + आते = आ + हन् + आते (I. 2. 4) and (VI. 4. 98) सार्वधातुकमपित् गमहनजनखनघसां लोपः क्ङि त्यनङि) = आघ्नाते (VII. 3. 54), (हो हन्तेण्ञिन्नेषु) Pl. आघ्नते.\n\nNot so when these verbs are used in the transitive, as आयच्छति कूपाद्रज्जुम् 'he draws up the rope from the well,' आहन्ति वृषलं पादेन 'they kill the sinner with the foot.'\n\nVart:- When the object is some member of the agent's own body these verbs take the _Atmanepada_ terminations though transitive. As आयच्छते पाणिम् 'he puts forth his own hand.' आहते शिरं 'he hurts his own head.' When the object is some limb of another's body, the terminations are of the _Parasmaipada_, as आहन्ति शिरः परकीयं 'they hurt others' head.'",
    "13029": "The above seven verbs when preceded by the preposition सम् and used in the intransitive, take the terminations of the _Atmanepada_. As संगच्छते  (VII. 3. 77) 'he joins,' समृच्छते 'he becomes hard or goes.' संपृच्छते 'he asks,' संस्वरते 'he blames,' समरन्त 'they are attained.' In the case of this last verb which belongs both to _Bhvadi_ and _Juhutyadi_ classes it is _Atmanepadi_ only in the Aorist. As सम् + ऋ + अङ् + त (III. 1. 56) सर्तिशास्त्यर्त्तिभ्यश्च) = समृत, as मा समृत (VI. 4. 75) बहुलंछन्दस्यमाङ्योगेऽपि) सम् + ऋ + अङ् + अन्त = समरन्त (VII. 4. 16) ऋदृशौऽङिगुणः). This occurs generally in the Vedas. The verb विद् must have the meaning of 'to know,' and not that of 'to acquire.' संशृणुते 'he hears,' संवित्ते 'he knows.'\n\nVart:- The root दृश् (to see) after the preposition सम् when used intransitively takes the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ as संपश्यते 'he sees.' But when transitive, it takes _Parasmaipada_ terminations as ग्रामम् संपश्यति 'he sees the town.'",
    "13030": "The verb ह्वेः 'to call' whether transitive or intransitive is _Atmanepadi_ after the above prepositions. The condition of being Intransitive does not apply to this _sutra_, and from this _sutra_ forward general rules of _Atmanepada_ are treated of. As निह्वयते, संह्वयते, उपह्वयते ॥\n\nThe verb ह्वे is marked in the _Dhatupatha_ with a ञ् and therefore, by _sutra_ 72 of this Chapter, it will take the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. But even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the verb _hve_ takes the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ when preceded by the above prefixes.\n\nVart:- The verbs अस् 'to throw' and ऊह 'to note' take optionally _Atmanepada_ affixes when compounded with _upasargas_. As निरस्यति—०ते 'he casts out,' समूहति—०ते 'he collects.'",
    "13031": "As मल्लो मल्लामाह्वयते 'an athlete challenges another athlete (in order to conquer him)'; छात्रश्छात्रमाह्वयते 'one student emulates with another student.'\n\nThis _sutra_ is also for the purpose of showing that the root _hve_ takes the _Atmanepada_ terminations even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nThe word _spardha_ means to emulate, to vie, to desire, to conquer another. When the verb _hve_ has not the above signification, it takes the terminations of the _parasmaipada_. As गामाह्वयति गोपालः 'the cowherd calls the cows.'",
    "13032": "The verb कृञ् by _sutra_ 72 would take the affixes of the _Atmanepada_ when the direct fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This _sutra_ has been begun to show that this verb takes the _Atmanepada_ terminations under certain circumstances even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nThe word _gandhana_ comes from the root _gandh_ 'to injure,' of _churadi_ class and means to inform against another maliciously with the object of injuring such person. _Avakshepana_ means 'to revile', 'to over-come,' _sevana_ means 'to obey and serve,' _sahasikya_ means 'an act of violence,' _pratiyatna_ means, 'imparting a new quality or virtue,' _prakathana_ means 'to narrate fully,' _upayoga_ means 'the disposal of a thing for the object of attaining &c.'\n\nThus उत्कुरुते, उदाकुरुते a means he informs against; (2) श्येनो वर्तिकामुदाकुरुते 'the hawk overcomes or reviles a snail,' (3) गणिकानुपकुरुते 'he serves the prostitutes,' महामात्राननुकुरुते 'he serves the _mahamatra_,' (4) परदारान् प्रकुरुते 'he outrages another's wife,' (5) एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the fuel gives a new quality (boils) to the water (or he prepares the wood and water for a sacrifice).' The object of the verb _kri_ takes the affix of the sixth case i. e. genitive, only when the verb means _pratiyatna_, see _Sutra_ (II. 3. 53) (कृञः प्रतियत्ने) । Therefore _udakasya_, though an object, has genitive form. The verb takes the augment सुट् only when it is preceded by _upa_ and signifies _pratiyatna_, see (VI. 1. 139). (उपात् प्रतियत्न वैकृत वाक्याध्याहारेषु) ॥ Therefore, there is the insertion of sibilant in _upaskurute_. (5) गाथाः प्रकुरुते 'he recites stories,' जनापवादान् प्रकुरुते 'he recites slander,' (6) शतं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a hundred pieces of money, for the sake of merit.' सहस्रं प्रकुरुते 'he devotes a thousand.'\n\nWhy do we say in these senses? Witness कटं करोति 'he makes a mat.' In this case the _atmanepada_ affix is not employed.\n\nThe verb _kri_ is understood in the three succeeding _sutras_.",
    "13033": "This _sutra_ is commenced to show that _kri_ may take the _atmanepada_ affix even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word _prasahana_ means 'to overcome, to be not defeated,' As तमधिचक्रे 'he overcame him or he was not defeated by him.'\n\nWhy do we say, 'in the sense of to overcome?' Witness अर्थमधिकरोति 'he learns the meaning' in which example the _atmanepada_ affix is not employed.\n\nThe necessity of making a separate _sutra_ of this rule, instead of including it in the last aphorism, arose with the object of giving a distinctive meaning to the prefix _adhi_.",
    "13034": "The word _karma_ in the _sutra_ indicates objective case or _karaka_; and does not express 'action,' as in some previous _sutras_ such as (I. 3. 24) _ante_.\n\nAs क्रोष्टा विकुरुते स्वरान् 'the birds are making noise,' ध्वांक्षो विकुरुते स्वरान् ॥\n\nThe word वि governs the succeeding _sutra_.\n\nWhy do we say \"when governing a word expressive of sound in the objective case\"? Witness चित्तं विकरोति कामः 'love affects the mind.'",
    "13035": "As विकुर्व्वन्ते सैन्धवा 'the horses move gracefully,' ओदनस्य पूर्णाश्छात्रा विकुर्वंते 'the students being full of food are acting as they will or are aimlessly wandering about.'",
    "13036": "This _sutra_ is begun in order to show that the verb नी may take the terminations of the _Atmanepada_, even when the direct fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, in the following cases, viz, when it means to 'respect' &c.\n\n_Sammanana_ means to respect; as नयते चर्वी लोकायते 'the _Charvi_ gives instruction in the _Lokayata_ _sastra_.' The word _charvi_ primarily means intelligence, and by secondary use it has been extended to the preceptor also; such a preceptor gives instruction, in _Lokayata_ _Sastra_, that is to say, having established the truth of the doctrines of that philosophy by argumentation, imparts them to the pupils. Those doctrines being thus established by reason, become respected (_Sanmanita_) and honored.\n\n_Utsanjana_, 'to throw up, or lift up,' as माणवकमुदानयते 'he lifts up _Manavaka_.'\n\n_Acharya_-_karana_ 'acting as a teacher,' that is to say, to bring a boy near oneself in such a way, that being so brought near (_upa_-_neta_), he may himself become an _acharya_, As माणवकमुपनयते 'he initiates _Manavaka_ (i.e., making himself the preceptor he brings the boy near himself.')\n\n_Jnana_ means 'knowledge, a demonstrated verity.' As नयते चर्वीलोकायते 'the _Charvi_ investigates the truth of the _Lokayata_ doctrine.'\n\n_Bhriti_ means 'wages.' As कर्मकारानुपनयते 'he employs the servants on hire or wages.'\n\n_Viganana_ means the paying off as a tribute, debts &c. As मद्रा करं विनयन्ते, the _Madras_ pay the tax due to the king, that is, they discharge the debt.'\n\n_Vyaya_ means 'allotment of money on works of merit &c.' As शतं विनयते 'he expends a hundred pieces on religious acts.' सहस्रं विनयते 'he devotes a thousand.\n\nWhy do we say, in these senses? Witness अजां नयति ग्रामम् 'he carries the goat to the village.' Here there is no _Atmanepada_ affix, as the verb has not any one of the above significations.",
    "13037": "The verb नी is _Atmanepadi_ when governing an object which has no material body, but is an abstract noun, that is an object which has abstract but no concrete existence; and when such an object has its seat in a portion of the agent of the verb. As क्रोधं विनयते 'he subdues his own anger,' मन्युं विनयते 'he suppresses anger.'\n\nThe word _sarira_ means the body of living beings, any portion of such body is also called _sarira_.\n\nThe object must reside in the agent, (_kartristha_), otherwise the verb will be _parasmaipadi_. As देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य क्रोधं विनयति '_Devadatta_ removes _Yajnadatta_'s anger.'\n\nThe object moreover must be immaterial, otherwise the affix will be of _parasmaipada_. As गडुं विनयति 'he removes his own wort.' घाठां विनयति 'he bows his neck.'\n\nWhy do we say 'in the case of an object ?' Witness बुद्ध्या विनयति 'he is submissive through knowledge,' प्रज्ञया विनयति. Here the verb विनयति has not taken an accusative case, but is in construction with an instrumental case, and therefore the present rule does not apply.",
    "13038": "The word '_kram_' governs the succeeding _sutras_ up to (I. 3. 43) and is understood in them all.\n\nThe verb _kram_ by _sutra_ (I. 3. 78) (after the rest, let the _parasmaipada_ affixes be employed in marking the agent), would have taken the affixes of the _parasmaipada_; the present aphorism enjoins _Atmanepada_ affixes in certain cases when the verb means to have a taste for &c.\n\n_Vritti_ 'continuity' means unobstructed, or want of interruption (i. e., a taste for, or facility in, anything), _sarga_ 'energy' means application, resolution and determination. _Tayana_ 'development' means increase and growth.\n\nAs (1) ऋक्ष्वस्य क्रमते बुद्धिः - 'his reason proceeds unobstructed through the _Rig_. scriptures i. e., he can easily comprehend the _Rig_.' (2). व्याकरणाध्ययनाय क्रमते 'the pupil shows energy or exerts to study the grammar.' (3). अस्मिनशास्त्राणि क्रमन्ते 'the _shastras_ are developed in him.'\n\nWhy in these senses only? Witness अपक्रामति 'he runs away.'",
    "13039": "The words _vritti_ &c., of the last _sutra_ are understood here also. Why has this been made a separate _sutra_ and not included in the last? The reason is to make a restrictive rule in the cases of _upasargas_; that is to say, only in the cases of the _upasargas_ _upa_ and _para_, there is _atmanepada_ affix; but not so when any other _upasarga_ precedes the verb _kram_, though the sense may be of continuity &c. Thus उपक्रमते 'he commences to advance,' पराक्रमते 'he marches to attack.'\n\nWhy do we say after the _upasargas_ '_upa_ and _para_'? Because, after any other preposition the affix will be of the _parasmaipada_; as संक्रामति 'he makes progress.' If the sense is not that of \"continuity\" &c., _parasmaipada_ will be employed, as उपक्रामति, पराक्रामति.",
    "13040": "As आक्रमते सूर्यः 'the sun rises.' आक्रमते चन्द्रमाः 'the moon rises,' आक्रमन्त ज्योतींषि 'the stars rise.'\n\nVart:- This ascending must refer to heavenly bodies. Therefore in, आक्रामति धूमोहर्म्यतलात्, 'the smoke rises from the surface of the terrace,' the verb क्रम is _parasmaipadi_. Why do we say in the sense of \"to ascend\"? Witness आक्रमति माणवकः कुतपम् 'the boy assails the ox.'",
    "13041": "As वाजी विक्रमते 'the horse is pacing.' The term _vikramana_ is applied to the special movements of horse &c.\n\nThough in the _Dhatupatha_ (catalogue of verbal roots), the verb क्रमि and क्रमु have the meanings of _pada_-_viharana_ and _pada_-_vikshepa_, that is \"throwing or placing of foot,\" and so it might be objected that the present _sutra_ is a useless repetition, yet as verbs have various other meanings than what is assigned to them in the _dhatupatha_, the present _sutra_ is not unnecessary.\n\nWhy do we say \"in the sense of throwing of foot\"? In any other sense, the terminations will be those of the _parasmaipada_. As विक्रामति अजिनसन्धिः 'the fold of the antilope skin is ruptured.'",
    "13042": "As प्रक्रमते भोक्तुम्, उपक्रमते भोक्तुम् 'he commences to eat' &c.\n\nThe prefixes _pra_ and _upa_ are synonyms, when they denote the commencement of an action.\n\nWhy do we say, \"when they are synonyms.\" Witness the following पूर्वेद्युः प्रक्रामति अपरेद्युरुपक्रामति 'he goes during the first part of the day and he comes back during the latter part of the day.' Here in one case the sense is \"to go,\" in another it means \"to return.\"\n\nWhy in the latter case of '_aparedyur_ _upakramati_' there is not _Atmanepada_ by virtue of _sutra_ (I. 3. 39) _ante_, as there is the _upasarga_ _upa_ here? The answer is that Rule (I. 3. 39) is not applicable, as that rule is limited by the condition of the sense of 'continuity' &c. while in the present _sutra_, that limitation is not applicable.",
    "13043": "The root '_kram_' may always be conjugated as _Atmanepadi_ when not having any _upasarga_. The _upasarga_ will be defined in (I. 4. 59). The option allowed by this _sutra_ is an example of what is technically known as _aprapta_ _vibhasa_ viz., an option which is not an alternative limitation to a general rule already found or known.\n\nExamples: क्रमते or क्रामति 'he goes over.' Why do we say 'when it is without any preposition ?' For no option is allowed when it takes preposition. As संक्रामति.",
    "13044": "The root _jna_ which ordinarily means 'to know' and is _parasmaipadi_ by rule (I. 3. 78), becomes _Atmanepadi_ when through the virtue of any prefix it means 'to deceive:' as अपजानीते 'he deceives,' शतमपजानीते 'he denies the debt of a hundred rupees,' सहस्रमपजानीते 'denies a thousand.'\n\nWhy do we say when meaning \"to deny ?\" Observe:- न त्वं किंचिदपि ज्ञानासि 'thou knowest not anything.'",
    "13045": "As सर्पिषो जानीते मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice by means of clarified butter or honey.' (See (II. 3. 51)).\n\nThis _Atmanepadi_ form of _jna_ is employed when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. From _sutra_ (I. 3. 76) it will be seen that when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, the verb is _Atmanepadi_.\n\nHow in the above example the verb _jna_ is intransitive? Because the word _sarpih_ is not the object of knowledge, but it is an instrument of sacrifice, into which one engages from complete knowledge (_jnana_); and it (_sarpishah_) is in the genitive case by virtue of (II. 3. 51) (ज्ञोऽविदर्थस्य करणे) by which the instrumental _karaka_ of the _jna_ is put in the genitive case.\n\nWhy do we say of \"Intransitive\"? Because in the transitive it is _parasmaipadi_, as स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he knows (recognizes) the son by his voice.'",
    "13046": "The word _jna_ is understood in this _sutra_: and the aphorism applies to that _jna_ which is used in the transitive. As शतं संजानीते 'he looks for a hundred,' So सहस्रं प्रतिजानीते 'he promises a thousand.'\n\nWhy do we say when 'not meaning remembering with regret?' Because it is not _Atmanepadi_, when it conveys that meaning. Thus मातुः संजानाति 'he remembers with regret his mother,' पितुः संजानाति ॥",
    "13047": "By _sutra_ (I. 3. 78), _vad_ generally takes the terminations of the _Parasmaipada_. By the present _sutra_, it takes also the affixes of the _Atmanepada_ when having certain meanings.\n\n_Bhasana_, (shining) means to illumine as वदते चर्वी लोकायते. The _charvi_ illumines the _Lokayat_ _shastras_, by his discourses and clear exposition.\n\n_Upasambhasha_ (persuasions) means to appease, to conciliate, as कर्मकरानुपवदते 'he conciliates or cajoles the servants.'\n\n_jnana_ (knowledge) means to know completely, as वदते चर्वी लोकायते 'the _charvi_ knows completely to discourse upon _Lokayat_ _shastra_.'\n\n_Yatna_ (endeavour) means energy, as क्षेत्रे वदते 'He toils in the field,' गेहे वदते 'he toils in the house.'\n\n_Vimati_ (disagreement) means dissension, want of unanimus opinion As क्षेत्रे विवदन्ते, 'they disagree over the field,' i.e., holding different opinions they talk diversely.\n\n_Upamantrana_ (enticing) means to coax in secret, as, कुलभार्यामुपवदते 'he entices the wife of a respectable family (i.e., seduces her in secret),' परदारानुपवदते 'he flatters another's wife.'\n\nWhy in the above senses only? See यत् किंचिद्वदति 'he says something'.",
    "13048": "As संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः 'the _Brahmanas_ are speaking.' But in संप्रवदन्ति कुक्कुटाः 'the cocks are crowing' it is properly _Parasmaipadi_.\n\nThe sense of the _sutra_ is that when men, who are only capable of articulate speech, speak all in one and the same time, then the verb _vad_ takes the affix of the _Atmanepada_. When lower animals make a chorus of noise, the verb does not take the _Atmanepada_\n\nThere must be _samuchcharana_ for the application of this rule; when there is no _samuchcharana_ or speaking in a chorus, this rule does not apply, as ब्राह्मणो वदति 'the _Brahmana_ speaks.'",
    "13049": "As अनुवदते कठः कलापस्य _katha_ is echoing or imitates _kalapa_. He reutters exactly what the _kalapa_-reader or the teacher says. The word _anu_ here means similarly.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the Intransitive'? Because when it is used in the transitive it takes the affixes of the _Parasmaipada_. As पूर्वमेव यजुरुदितमनुवदति, 'he repeats the _yajurveda_ which he had learned before.'\n\nThe words 'uttering of articulate speech' are understood here also. Otherwise अनुवदति वीणा 'the lute resounds,' here it is _Parasmaipada_.",
    "13050": "As विप्रवदन्ते or न्ति वैद्याः (the doctors are at variance). The words _vyaktavacham_ (articulate utterance) and _samuchcharana_ (speaking together) are understood in this _sutra_ also.\n\nNo option is allowed when the sense is not that of contradiction or wrangling as, संप्रवदन्ते ब्राह्मणाः, 'the _Brahmanas_ are speaking together.'\n\nThe phrase 'articulate utterance' is necessary in this also. Because as विप्रवदन्ति शकुनयः 'the kites are quarrelling,' the verb is in the _Parasmaipada_.\n\nThe wrangling must be by talking at one and the same time, otherwise this rule will not apply. As क्रमेण वैद्या वैद्येन सह विप्रवदन्ति, 'the doctors contradict by turn another doctor.'",
    "13051": "As अवगिरति (he swallows). The root _gri_ to swallow preceded by the preposition _ava_ is _Atmanepadi_. The verb _gri_ taken in this _sutra_ means to swallow and belongs to the _Tudadi_ class. It is not the _gri_ 'to make sound' which belongs to the _kryadi_ class, because there is no word formed with the latter verb by affixing the preposition _ava_ to it. By _sutra_ (I. .3. 78) this verb _gri_ 'to swallow' would have been _Parasmaipadi_; the present _sutra_ debars that.\n\nWhen it is not preceded by _ava_, it is _Parasmaipadi_, as गिरति 'he swallows.'",
    "13052": "As शनं संगिरते, 'he promises to pay a hundred rupees.' If it does not mean to promise or acknowledge, it takes _parasmaipada_ terminations. As संगिरति ग्रासम्, 'he swallows the mouthful.'",
    "13053": "As गेहमुच्चरते 'he strays away from home;' गुरुवचनमुच्चरते 'he transgresses the commands of his preceptor.'\n\nWhy do we say \"when used in the transitive\"? Observe बाष्पमुच्चरति 'the vapour is rising.' Here it is _parasmaipadi_.",
    "13054": "As अश्वेन संचरते 'he rides on the horse-back.'\n\nThe rule does not apply when it is not in composition with a word in the instrumental case. As उभौ लोकौ संचरति इमं चामुं च देवल ! _O_ _Devala_! thou wanderest through both regions, this and that.' Here though the sense of the Instrumental case is implied, yet as it is not expressly stated, we use the _parasmaipada_ terminations.",
    "13055": "When is the 3rd case used with the force of the 4th case? That is answered by the following.\n\nVart:- The Instrumental has the force of the Dative when immoral conduct is implied. As दास्या or वृषल्या संप्रयच्छते 'he gives with the object of enticing to the female slave or prostitute.'\n\nThe verb _da_ to give is generally _parasmaipadi_, it becomes _atmanepadi_ under the above conditions.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it has the force of the dative case\"? Because when it has not the sense of the dative, _parasmaipada_ terminations will be used, as पाणिना संप्रयच्छति, 'he gives with his hand.'\n\nIt might be asked how the _atmanepada_ terminations are employed when the preposition _sam_ is not directly applied to the verb, but another preposition _pra_, intervenes between _sam_ and the verb. The reply is that the word _samah_ in _sutra_ (I. 3. 54) is not in the ablative case (which would have required its being placed immediately before the verb), but it is in the genitive case, and is used as an attribute.",
    "13056": "This is clear. As भार्यामुपयच्छते 'he espouses or knows his wife.' But not so when another's wife is meant; there it is _parasmaipadi_.\n\nBy rule (I. 3. 78), the verb _yam_ would have been _parasmaipadi_, but the present _sutra_ makes an exception, when the root takes the preposition _upa_ and means \"to marry, to espouse, or to accept.\" The meaning of _sva_-_karana_ is confined to accepting in general. This is according to _Kasika_; according to _Mahabhashya_, _sva_-_karana_ means to make one's own what was not previously his own.\n\nWhy do we say in the sense of \"marrying\"? When it has any other sense, _parasmaipada_ affixes will be employed, as देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तस्य भार्यामुपयच्छति, _Devadatta_ has illicit intercourse with the wife of _Yajnadatta_.'",
    "13057": "The above four roots are _atmanepadi_ when in the Desiderative form, the suffix \"_san_\" being the _pratyaya_ by which desideratives are formed.\n\nThe verb _jna_ takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_ when used in the senses indicated by the three _sutras_ (I. 3. 44), (I. 3. 45) and (I. 3. 46) already explained. The desiderative form of _jna_ would ex necessitate take _atmanepada_ affixes when used in the above senses: see Rule (I. 3. 62). The present _sutra_ however enlarges the scope of _atmanepada_, by declaring all desideratives of _jna_ to be _atmanepada_, in whatever sense they may be used.\n\nSimilarly by _sutra_ (I. 3. 29) _ante_ and the _vartika_ under it, the roots _sru_, and _dris_ take the terminations of the _atmanepada_; when preceded by _sam_, the desideratives of those would of course have taken _atmanepada_ affixes by (I. 3. 62), but the present _sutra_ makes it general.\n\nThe present _sutra_ however enunciates a new rule in the case of the root _smri_.\n\nAs धर्म्मं जिज्ञासते 'he wishes to know (i. e. enquires after) religion,' गुरुं शुश्रूषते 'he serves the teacher,' नष्टं सुस्मूर्षते 'he wishes to remember the lost.' नृपं दिदृक्षते 'he wishes to see the king.'\n\nWhy do we say, when taking the affix _san_? Because the primitive verbs will take the _parasmaipada_ terminations as जानाति 'he knows,' शृणोति 'he hears,' स्मरति 'he remembers' पश्यति 'he sees.'",
    "13058": "This is an exception to the last _sutra_. The desiderative of _jna_ with the prefix _anu_ is not _atmanepadi_.\n\nThis _sutra_ read with _sutra_ (I. 3. 45) limits the scope of _parasmaipada_ to the transitive, desiderative verb _anu_-_jna_. As पुत्रमनुजिज्ञासति 'he enquires after the son.'\n\nWhy do we say when preceded by _anu_? Because otherwise it will take the _atmanepada_ terminations. As धर्म्मम् जिज्ञासते 'he inquires after religion.'",
    "13059": "The verb _sru_ when taking the prefixes _prati_ and _an_, is not _atmanepadi_, though taking the desiderative \"_san_.\" This is also an exception to the rule of _sutra_ (I. 3. 57). Thus प्रतिशुश्रूषति and आशुश्रूषति ॥\n\nThe word _prati_ and _an_ must be _upasargas_; if they are used as _karma_ _pravachaniyas_ (see (1. 4.—83)) then the rule will not apply, as देवदत्तं प्रतिशुश्रूषते ॥",
    "13060": "The root '_sad_' when taking any affix which is marked with an indicatory श, is conjugated in the _atmanepadi_. In connection with this must be read _sutra_ (VII. 3.  78).पाघ्राध्मास्थाम्नादाण्दृश्यर्तिसर्तिशदसदांपिबजिघ्रधमतिष्ठमनयच्छपश्यर्च्छधौशीयसीदाः by which the root शद् is replaced by शीय before the affixes having an indicatory श. Thus शद् + श + ते = शीय + अते = शीयते 'he decays or withers,' शीयेते 'they two decay,' शीयन्ते 'they decay.'\n\nWhy do we say before affixes having an indicatory श? Before other affixes it is not _atmanepadi_. As अशत्स्यत् 'if he decayed,' शत्स्यति 'he will decay,' शिशत्सति.\n\nThe well-known _vikaranas_ like शप्, श &c., the affixes like शतृ &c., are शित् affixes. In other words the root _sad_ is _atmanepadi_ in all conjugational tenses.",
    "13061": "This is a restrictive _sutra_, the root मृङ् (to die), is marked with a ङ् as an indicatory letter; so by _sutra_ (I. 3. 12) it would be always _Atmanepadi_. But the present aphorism restricts it to लुङ् _lun_ (Aorist) and लिङ _lin_ (Benedictive) tenses as well as to those tenses which are शित्. It will be found hereafter that out of the ten tenses, those that take शित् affixes are the special tenses, i. e., the Present, the Imperfect, the Potential and the Imperative.\n\nIt is only before these three affixes, namely, _lin_, _lun_, and _sit_ affixes, that the root _mri_ takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_. Thus the aorist अमृत _amrita_ he died; Benedictive मृषीष्ट _mrishishta_ 'may he die.' Similarly before _sit_ affixes : thus म्रियते 'he dies,' = भृ + श + ते (VII. 4. 28) रिङ् शयग्लिङ् क्षु) म्रिय + अ + ते = म्रियते (VI. 4. 77). अचि श्नुधातुभ्रुंवां य्वोरियङुवङौ) म्रियेते, म्रियन्ते The root मृ belongs to the sixth class of verbs called _Tudadi_ which take the _vikarana_ श in the conjugational tenses (III. 1. 77).\n\nIn other tenses, viz., the two Futures, the Perfect and the conditional, this verb is _parasmaipadi_. As मरिष्यति he will die. अमरिष्यत्.",
    "13062": "If the primary verb is _parasmaipadi_, its desiderative will be also _parasmaipadi_; if the primary verb is _Atmanepadi_, its desiderative will be _Atmanepadi_. This is the general rule. Some exceptions to it have already been mentioned in _sutras_ (I. 3. 57), (I. 3. 58), and (I. 3. 59). A root which was _atmanepadi_, before taking the Desiderative affix सन् _san_, will be _atmanepadi_ even when it takes the affix सन् _san_. In other words, that by reason of which the _atmanepada_ affixes were ordained in the primary verb, will cause the same terminations to be applied when the verb ends in सन् _san_. Thus it was said in _sutra_ (I. 3. 12), that roots having an _anudatta_ accented vowel as indicatory or a ङ् in as their indicatory letter take the terminations of the _atmanepada_. Thus आस्ते 'he sits down' and शेते 'he sleeps.' The verb आस् (to sit down) and शीङ् (to lie down) will remain _atmanepadi_, even when they are used as Desideratives. Thus असिसिषते 'he wishes to lie down.' Similarly _sutra_ (I. 3. 17) declared that the verb निविश् is _atmanepadi_, as निविशते. This will be _atmanepadi_ also in the Desiderative form, as निविविक्षते 'he wishes to enter.' So also by _sutra_ (I. 3. 40), आक्रमते is _atmanepadi_, the Desiderative आचिक्रंसते will also be _atmanepadi_.\n\nBut though by (I. 3. 60) and (I. 3. 61), शीयते and म्रियते are _atmanepadi_, yet शिशत्सति 'he wishes to lie down,' मुमूर्षति 'he wishes to die,' are _parasmaipadi_. Because the _atmanepada_ affixes were ordained after the roots शद and मृङ् only under exceptional conditions and not generically, and as those conditions do not exist in the desiderative, the latter does not take _atmanepada_ terminations.\n\nOf course that which in its primary state would not have taken the terminations of the _atmanepada_, there being a prohibition to that effect, will not allow them in its Desiderative form. As अनुचिकीर्षति 'he wishes to imitate.' पराचिकीर्षति. Here the root कृञ् by rule (I. 3. 79) has been especially declared to be _parasmaipadi_, to the exclusion of _atmanepada_ affixes which would otherwise have come by Rules (I. 3. 32) and (I. 3. 72), and therefore its Desiderative is also _parasmaipadi_. The force of ञ् causing _atmanepada_ is counteracted by (I. 3. 79).\n\nNow it might be asked :- True, this rule provides for those cases where a root is conjugated in two forms, one a Primitive and another a Desiderative conjugation. But what provision do you make for those partial verbs which take the affix सन् even in their primitive form; and in whose case we have no prior form to look upon as a guide in the application of _atmanepada_ affixes. And there are at least 7 such quasi-roots which take सन् in this way, called also the self-descriptive सन्. Those quasi-roots are गुप्, तिज्, कित्, मात्, वध, दान्, and शान्. \"What are we to do with these quasi-roots, which are always conjugated with the affix सन् and have no simpler conjugation ?\" To this we reply; \"In the case of these partial verbs which take the self-descriptive सन् the _pada_ will be regulated by the indicatory letters which these quasi-roots have.\" For though the full roots are जुगुप्स, तितिक्ष, चिकित्स, मीमान्स, बीभत्स, शीशन्स and दीदान्स, yet by the maxim अवयवे कृतं लिङ्गं समुदायस्य विशेषकं भवति, \"a sign made in a portion of a thing, qualifies the whole thing;\" the sign made in the expression गुप् &c., will qualify the whole verb जुगुप्स &c.\" Thus we have जुगुप्सते he despises, चिकित्सते he cures; मीमांसते he investigates, &c.",
    "13063": "This _sutra_ applies where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. There are in Sanskrit two forms of the perfect tense (लिट्): one formed in the ordinary way by the reduplication of the root and adding the terminations; the other called the periphrastic perfect, is formed by adding आम् to the root, and then affixing to it the perfect tense of the roots कृ (to do), भू (to be ) or अस् ( to be ). These latter verbs are called _anuprayoga_ or auxiliary verbs, as it is with their help that the perfect tense is formed. The question then arises, what conjugation, _parasmai_ or _atmanepada_, do these auxiliaries take in forming the periphrastic perfect? This _sutra_ supplies the answer :--the auxiliary कृ follows the conjugation of principals, the other auxiliaries do not. Thus the root एध (to increase, prosper) is _atmanepadi_, therefore in forming the periphrastic perfect, the verb कृ will be also in the _atmanepada_. Thus एधांचक्रे (he prospered). Similarly इद् (to appear with great splendour) is _parasmaipadi_ and the auxiliary कृ after it will be _parasmaipada_, as इन्दाञ्चकार (he appeared with great splendour).\n.\nBut the other auxiliaries भू and अस् retain their own peculiar conjugation and are not influenced by the conjugation of their principal. Thus एधाम्बभूव, एधामास.\n\nThe word _am_-_pratyaya_ of the _sutra_ means 'that after which the affix _am_ (III. I. 35) and (III. I. 36.) (कास्प्रत्ययादाममन्त्रे लिटि) comes.' Of the verb _krin_, when subjoined to another as an auxiliary, the termination is that of the _atmanepada_ like the verb that takes the affix _am_. If this _sutra_ enjoined a rule of injunction (_vidhi_), then there would be the termination of the _atmanepada_ even in examples like उदब्जांचकार and उदम्भांचकार where the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. This is no valid objection to the present _sutra_. It is to be interpreted in both ways, that is, both as a _vidhi_ (a general injunction) and a _niyama_ (a restrictive injunction). How is that to be done? Because the word _purvavat_ of the last _sutra_ is to be read in the present aphorism also. The second explanation in that case will be for the sake of establishing a _niyama_ or restrictive rule.\n\nIt has already been said above that the auxiliary verbs कृ, भू and अस् are used in forming the periphrastic perfect. This is done by force of the aphorism (III. I. 40), कृञ्चानुप्रयुज्यते लिटि, meaning, the verb _krin_ is annexed in the perfect tense, to verbs, that take _am_. In this _sutra_ (III. I. 40) the word _krin_ is a _pratyahara_, implying the verbs कृङ्, भू and अस्. It might be asked how is this _pratyahara_ formed? The word _kri_ is taken from the fourth word of _sutra_ (V. 4. 50), अभूतद्भावे कृभ्वस्तियोगे &c., and the letter _n_ is taken from _sutra_ (V. 4. 58) कृञोद्वितीय &c. This is the way in which the commentators explain how not only the verb _krin_ is used as an auxiliary in forming the periphrastic perfect, but also the verbs भू and अस्. These three verbs denoting absolute action unmodified by any especial condition have in all languages been fixed upon as the best auxiliaries.\n\nIt must, however, be noted that the word _krin_ in this _sutra_ is not used as a _pratyahara_ and consequently does not include the verbs भू and अस्.",
    "13064": "The verb युजिर् 'to join' is _svaritet_, and consequently by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) it is always _atmanepadi_, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present _sutra_ declares when this verb may take the terminations of _atmanepada_, even when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. After the verb युज् preceded by the prepositions  प्र and उप the terminations are of the _atmanepada_, when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels. As प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he joins or employs'; उपयुङ्क्ते 'he fits or uses.'\n\nWhy do we say \"when not employed in reference to sacrificial vessels?\" Because there the terminations will be of the _parasmaipada_. As द्वन्द्वं न्यञ्चि पात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति.\n\nVartika:- It shall be rather stated that the root takes the terminations of the _atmanepada_ when preceded by any preposition beginning or ending with a vowel. This is an important modification of the above rule. Thus उद्युङ्क्ते and नियुङ्क्ते. In fact, all _upasargas_, with the exception of सम्, निर्, and दुर्, either begin or end with a vowel, and therefore the _Vartika_ amounts to the inclusion of all prepositions with the above exception.\n\nWith सम्, निर् and दुर्, however, the root will take _parasmaipada_ terminations; as संयुनक्ति.",
    "13065": "The verb क्ष्णु 'to sharpen, whet, or grind,' is generally _parasmaipadi_, but it is _atmanepadi_, when it is preceded by the prefix सम्; as संक्ष्णुते शस्त्रम् 'he whets the weapon', संक्ष्णुवाते 'they two whet', संक्ष्णुवते 'they all whet.'\n\nIt might be objected, why has a separate aphorism been made of the verb _kshnu_, when it could well have been included in the _sutra_ (I. 3. 29) _ante_, which also speaks of the force of the prefix _sam_, when used with the verbs _gam_, _richchha_, &c. To this the answer is that, that _sutra_ treats of intransitive verbs, the word _akarmaka_ being understood therein, while the present _sutra_, as is evident from the example we have given above, treats of transitive verbs.",
    "13066": "The root _bhuj_ when it does not mean to protect, is _atmanepadi_. This root belongs to the _rudhadi_ class and has several meanings, as, to feed, to cherish, to preserve, to eat, and to enjoy. As भुंक्ते 'he eats or enjoys'; also _bhunjate_, _bhunjate_ &c. But पुत्रान् भुनक्ति पिता 'the father cherishes the sons', भुनक्त्येनमग्निराहितः.\n\nThe root _bhuj_ belongs also to the _tudadi_ class, but there it has the sense of being curved or crooked. The _bhuj_ belonging to the _tudadi_ class is not to be taken in this _sutra_, because that _bhuj_ has never the sense of protecting. Therefore बिभुजति पाणिम् 'he bends the hand,' is in the _parasmaipada_.",
    "13067": "The causatives (णिच्) are conjugated in the _atmanepadi_, when they are used in the passive voice, that is to say when a word which was an objective case in the ordinary verb becomes nominative case in the causative; and the nominative case of the ordinary verbs becomes objective case in the causative. In short when causatives are used in the passive voice, they are _atmanepadi_. This round-about phraseology has been employed, because the base of the active and the passive causatives do not differ in form; as आरोहते हस्तिपकान् हस्ती.\n\nThe phrase 'णेः (after the causatives)' of this _sutra_ governs the four succeeding _sutras_ and is understood in them. The _sutra_ consists of the following words:- णेः 'after the causative;' अणौ 'in the non-causative;' यत् 'what;' कर्म 'object;' णौ 'in the causative;' चेत् 'if;' सः 'that;' कर्ता 'nominative;' अनाध्यान 'except to remember.'\n\nIn general, by _sutra_ (I. 3. 74), the causative verbs take the terminations of the _atmanepada_, when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent. The present _sutra_ applies to the case where fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent.\n\nAfter the verbs that take the affix णिच्, the terminations are those of the _atmanepada_. How? When that which was the object when the primitive verb was used non-causatively, becomes also the object when the derivative verb is used causatively; and even that object becomes also the agent as well. There is exception, however, in the case when the verb means to 'remember with regret.' As आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant.' Let us paraphrase this sentence by transforming the primitive non-causative verb आरोहन्ति into a causative form. The sentence then will be, आरोहयते हस्ती स्वयमेव 'the elephant makes itself to be mounted.' Similarly उपसिंचन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers sprinkle the elephant'; and उपसेचयते हस्ती स्वयमेव 'the elephant makes itself to be sprinkled;' पश्यन्ति भृत्या राजानम् 'the attendants see the king'; and दर्शयते राजा स्वयमेव 'the king makes himself to be seen.'\n\nWhy do we say 'after the causatives?' Because the rule of this _sutra_, will not apply, if the verb though conveying the sense of a causal verb, is, however, not formed by the affix णिच्; as आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant;' and आरोहयमाणो हस्ती साध्वारोहति 'the elephant that is being mounted, mounts gracefully'. Here the terminations are of the _parasmaipada_ in the second case also.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the non-causative non-_ni_'? For this rule will not apply when the primitive verb itself is formed by the affix णिच्; such are the roots of the tenth class or _churadi_ in which the _nich_ is added in the self-descriptive sense, and not for a causative purpose. Thus the root गण belongs to _churadi_ class; whose causative and primitive forms are the same. As गणयति गणं गोपालकः 'the cowherd counts the herd;' and the causative form is गणयति गणः स्वयमेव 'the herd makes itself to be counted.' The terminations in both cases are those of the _parasmaipada_.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the object (_karma_) becomes the agent?' Because the rule will not apply, when any other _karaka_ or case, than the _karma_ or object, of the primitive verb becomes the agent in the causative. Thus लुनाति दात्रेण 'he cuts with the scythe,' लावयति दात्रं स्वयमेव 'the scythe is made to cut of itself.' Here the word _datra_ was the instrument of the primitive verb which became agent in the causative, and therefore in the causative the terminations are of the _parasmaipada_ only.\n\nWhy do we say 'if in the causative' in the _sutra_? It is for the purpose of indicating that the verb must be one and the same, both in the primary sentence and the causative sentence. Therefore the rule does not apply here where the causative verb सेचयति in the second sentence was not used in the first sentence; आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant;' and आरोहयमाणो हस्तीभीतान् सेचयति मूत्रेण 'the elephant that is being caused to mount is made to sprinkle with urine the frightened men'.\n\nThe word सः 'that' is employed in the aphorism to show that the objects in both sentences must be the same and not different. Therefore in the following example where the objects are different, the terminations of _parasmaipada_ are only used. आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant'; and आरोहयमाणो हस्ती स्थलमारोहयति मनुष्यान् 'the elephant, that is being caused to mount, makes men mount on the land.'\n\nWhy do we use the word _karta_ (agent) in the _sutra_ ? If the former object is not the agent in the second case, the terminations of the _parasmaipada_ only would be used. As आरोहन्ति हस्तिनं हस्तिपकाः 'the elephant-keepers mount the elephant;' and तानारोहयति महामात्रः 'the elephant-driver makes it to mount.'\n\nWhy do we say 'except when meaning to remember with tenderness?' Observe, स्मरति वनगुल्मस्य कोकिलः 'the dove remembers, with regret, the forest tree;' and स्मरयत्वेनं वनगुल्मः स्वयमेव 'the forest tree is made to be remembered of itself.'",
    "13068": "The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is understood in this _sutra_ and is to be supplied from the previous aphorism. This _sutra_ is also restricted to cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word हेतु in the aphorism has been defined later on in _sutra_ (I. 4. 55) (स्वतन्त्र कर्त्ता); it is the agent which is the mover of another's agent. When a fear is caused by a हेतु it is called हेतुभय. The word भय 'fear' in the aphorism is illustrative, and includes by implication विस्मय 'astonishment' also. As जटिलो भीषयते 'the _jatila_, the cock-headed frightens.' मुण्डो भीषयते 'the _munda_, the shave-headed frightens '; जटिलो विस्मापयते 'the _jatila_ astonishes,' मुण्डो विस्मापयते 'the _munda_ astonishes' i.e., the very fact of matted-hair or shaven-head frightens,' &c.\n\nWhy do we say हेतुभय? For if the fear or astonishment is not the direct result caused by the agent, but arises from something else, then the _atmanepada_ will not be used. As कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति 'he frightens him with the _kunchika_,' रूपेण विस्माययति 'he astonishes with his form'. Here _kunchika_ and _rupa_ are the instruments, which cause fear or astonishment, and are not the _hetu_ thereof.",
    "13069": "The phrase 'of the causatives ending in णि' is to be supplied here from _sutra_ (I. 3. 67). This _sutra_ is also restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word प्रलम्भन of the _sutra_ means deceiving. As मानवकं गर्धयते 'he deceives the boy,' मानवकं वञ्चयते 'he cheats the boy.'\n+\nWhy do we say 'when it means deceiving,' For these verbs have not this meaning, their causatives take _parasmaipada_. As श्वानं गर्धयति 'he causes the dog to bark,' अहिं वञ्चयति 'he avoids the serpent.'",
    "13070": "The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied here from _sutra_ (I. 3. 67). This _sutra_ has its scope only when the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. In the _Dhatupatha_, there are two roots ली, one is technically called लीङ् and means to stick, and belongs to _divadi_ class. The other ली meaning to 'melt' belongs to _kryadi_ class. As there is no specification in the _sutra_ what ली is to be taken, both are therefore taken.\n\nThe force of the word च in the _sutra_ is to include the word प्रलम्भन 'to delude' of the last _sutra_ into the present. The word संमानन means to show respect. The word शालीनीकरण means to subdue. As जठाभिरालापयते 'he gets respect or causes respect to be shown to him through or on account of his matted hair.' श्येनो वर्तिकामुल्लापयते 'the hawk subdues the partridge', कस्त्वामुल्लापयते 'who deceives thee.'\n\nThe _sutra_ विभाषा लीयतेः (VI. 1. 51) declares that the ई of ली is optionally changed into आं before certain terminations. But there is no option allowed when the root ली has any of the above three senses : in these cases the substitution of आ is necessary and not optional. For the option allowed by _sutra_ (VI. 1. 51) is a व्यवस्थितविभाषा and not a general विभाषा applicable everywhere.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it has the meaning of 'to show respect, &c.'? Because otherwise there is _parasmaipada_. As बालकमुल्लापयति.",
    "13071": "The phrase 'of the causative ending in णि' is to be supplied from _sutra_ (I. 3. 67). The aphorism is restricted to the cases where the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent. The word _abhyasa_ means doing again, or repetition; as पदं मिथ्या कारयति means 'he repeatedly pronounces the word incorrectly, that is with wrong accent, &c., not once but constantly'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word _mithya_ is used as an _upapada_?' The causative of _kri_ will take _parasmaipada_ when it has any other _upapada_. Thus पदं सुष्टुम् कारयति 'he pronounces the word correctly.'\n\nWhy do we say 'of the verb कृञ्? Because the causative of any other verb used along with the word _mithya_ will not have _atmanepada_; as पदं मिथ्या वाचयति 'he repeatedly utters the word wrongly.' Here वच् takes _parasmaipada_.\n\nWhy do we say 'repeatedly'? For if the incorrect utterance is not habitual, then _parasmaipada_ will be used; as पदं मिथ्याकारयति 'he pronounces wrongly, not always but once.'",
    "13072": "The _anuvritti_ of the phrase णेः does not go further. The word क्रियाफलं is a compound, meaning 'fruit of the action.' When the principal object for the sake of which the action is begun, is meant for the agent indicated by the verb, there the _atmanepada_ is used after verbs having an indicatory ञ or a _svarita_ accent. As यजते 'he sacrifices for himself'; पचते 'he cooks for himself.' Here the verb यज् and पच् are marked with _svarita_ accent in the _Dhatupatha_, and therefore they take the _atmanepada_ terminations.\n\nSimilarly सुनुते 'he presses the _soma_-juice,' कुरुते 'he does.' Here the verbs सुञ् and कृञ् have an indicatory ञ्.\n\nIn all the above cases, the principal object of the action such as getting heaven by performance of sacrifices, eating of food, &c., is meant for the agent. That is to say, he sacrifices in order that he himself may attain heaven, he cooks in order that he himself may eat, &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent'? Otherwise it will have _parasmaipada_. As यजन्ति याजकाः 'the priests sacrifice, (not for themselves, but for their clients)' पचन्ति पाचकाः 'the cooks cook (for their masters)'; कुर्वन्ति कर्मकराः 'the menials work (for their masters).' Here though the fees and the wages are the fruits which the agent gets, yet as that fruit is not the principal object for which the action was begun--the principal object of the sacrifice was not that the priest should get his fee, but that the sacrificer may go to heaven--the verb takes the terminations of the _Parasmaipada_. Here the principal fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, but to a third party.",

As कटं कारयते 'he causes the mat to be made for himself'; ओदनं पाचयते 'he causes the food to be cooked for himself.' When the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the _parasmaipada_ is used. As कटं कारयति परस्य 'he causes another's mat to be made.'",
    "13075": "The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is read into this aphorism by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ (I. 3. 72). As ब्रीहीन् संयच्छते 'he gathers rice'; भारमुद्यच्छते 'he lifts up the load'; वस्त्रमायच्छते 'he draws out the cloth.' The root _yam_ preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ by virtue of aphorism (I. 3. 28) _ante_; but in that aphorism the verb was intransitive, here it is transitive, and this explains the necessity of making two different _sutras_ for one compound verb आयम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not refer to a book.' For otherwise the verb will take the terminations of the _parasmaipada_. As उद्यच्छति चिकित्सां वैद्यः 'the physician diligently studies medicine.'\n\nWhen however the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the above compound verbs are _parasmaipadi_. As संयच्छति, उद्यच्छति, आयच्छति.",
    "13076": "The phrase 'when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent' is understood in this _sutra_ also. Thus गां जानीते 'he recognises the cow as his own'; अश्वं जानीते 'he recognises the horse as his own.'\n\nWhy do we say when not preceded by any _upasarga_ ? For when compounded with prepositions, it may take the _Atmanepada_ terminations; as स्वर्गं लोकं न प्रजानाति मूढः 'the fool does not know the heavenly regions.'\n\nWhen, however, the fruit of the action does not accrue to the agent, the simple root ज्ञा takes _parasmaipada_ terminations. देवदत्तस्य गां जानाति 'he recognises _Devadatta_'s cow.'",
    "13077": "By the preceding five _sutras_ (I. 3. 72) to (I. 3. 76), _Atmanepada_ terminations were ordained to come after verbs which implied the accrual of the fruit of the action to the agent, that is to say, where the verb by itself denoted this. But when the same idea, instead of being inherent in the verb, is expressed by an _upapada_, that is by a word governed by the verb, the necessity of using the _Atmanepada_ affixes, to denote the same idea, is obviously removed, and in such a case it is optional whether we use the _Atmanepada_ or the _Parasmaipada_ terminations. As स्वं यज्ञं यजति or यजते 'he sacrifices for his own _yajna_'; स्वं कटं करोति or कुरुते 'he makes his own cot.'; स्वं पुत्रमपवदति or अपवदते; स्वंमोदनं पाचवते or पाचयति, &c. So on with all the above five _sutras_.",
    "13078": "The rules of _Atmanepada_ have been declared in the preceding 66 _sutras_, (I. 3. 12) to (I. 3. 77). The terminations of the _Parasmaipada_, which are the general verbal terminations, will come everywhere else, that is to say, where its operation is not debarred by any one of the preceding aphorisms. The present _sutra_ declares this universal rule. The word _sesha_ or the rest, means that which is the residue after the application of all the previous restrictive rules. Thus it was declared by _sutra_ (I. 3. 12) _ante_ that a root having an _Anudatta_ vowel or a ङ as _it_, will take _Atmanepada_ termisations. As आस्ते शेते. The converse of this will take _parasmaipada_ terminations, namely all verbs which do not have an _anudatta_ accent or a ङ as _it_. Thus याति 'he goes,' वाति 'it blows.' It has been declared by _sutra_ (I. 3. 17) that the root विश when preceded by नि takes _Atmanepada_ terminations, as निविशते. When not preceded by नि but any other preposition, it will take the _parasmaipada_ termination. As आविशति, प्रविशति.\n\nWhy do we say \"when marking the agent\"? For when used in the passive voice the root will take the _Atmanepada_ termination. As पच्यते 'it is cooked', गम्यते 'it is gone.'\n\nWhy is not _parasmaipada_ used when the verb is employed reflexively ? As in the following example :- पच्यते ओदनः स्वयमेव 'the food cooks of itself.' Because in the present _sutra_ the word कर्तरि of _sutra_ (I. 3. 14) _ante_ is to be read in by _anuvritti_, so that, in fact there are two कर्तरि in this aphorism which thus means \"when the agent of the verb is an agent pure and simple then _parasmaipada_ is employed.\" While when a verb is used reflexively (कर्म्मकर्तरि) the agent of the verb is also, in one aspect, the object of the verb; and it is therefore, that in reflexive verbs the _Atmanepada_ terminations are employed.",
    "13079": "By aphorism (I. 3. 32) _ante_, the root कृ took the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ when the sense denoted was that of \"divulging, reviling,\" &c., and it also took _Atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent by virtue of _sutra_ (I. 3. 72), because the root कृञ् has an indicatory ञ. The present _sutra_ makes an exception to those rules, and ordains _parasmaipada_. Thus अनुकरोति 'he imitates,' पराकरोति 'he does well.'",
    "13080": "The root क्षिप् to throw, is _svariteta_ therefore by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) _ante_, it would have taken _Atmanepada_ termination, when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent; this aphorism ordains _parasmaipada_ instead. As अभिक्षिपति 'he throws on,' प्रतिक्षिपति 'he turns away or rejects,' अतिक्षिपति 'he throws beyond.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when coming after _abhi_, _prati_, and _ati_'? Because when compounded with any other preposition, it will not take _parasmaipada_, but will be governed by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72). As आक्षिपते 'he throws down.'\n\nThe second कर्तृ of _sutra_ (I. 3. 14) is also understood here, so that when the verb is used reflexively, the agent not being purely an agent, the present _sutra_ will not apply. As अभिक्षिप्यते स्वयमेव 'it is thrown on of itself.'",
    "13081": "The root वह to carry is _svaritet_, and by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) it would have taken the _Atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. But the present _sutra_ ordains _parasmaipada_ instead. As प्रवहति 'it flows.'\n\nWhy do we say \"when coming after _pra_\"? Because after any other preposition it will not take _parasmaipada_, as आवहते 'he brings.'",
    "13082": "The root मृष \"to suffer\" is _svaritet_, and by _sutra_ (I. 3. 72) it would have taken _Atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This ordains _parasmaipada_ instead. As परमृष्यति 'he endures or he becomes angry.' When not preceded by this preposition, it takes _Atmanepada_ termination. As आमृष्यते.\n\nAccording to some authors, the root वह of the last aphorism is said to be understood in this, so that वह preceded by परि will also take _parasmaipada_ terminations; as परिवहति",
    "13083": "The verb रम् means 'to sport.' It is _anudattet_ and therefore by _sutra_ (I. 3. 12) it would have taken _Atmanepada_ terminations; the present _sutra_ ordains _parasmaipada_ instead, as विरमति 'he takes rest'; आरमति 'he delights in,' परिरमति 'he sports.'\n\nWith other prepositions than these, it will take _atmanepada_ termination. As अभिरमते",
    "13084": "As देवदत्तमुपरमति 'he causes _Devadatta_ to refrain.' The sense of the verb _uparamati_ is causative here, as if it was उपरमयति. This is an example of a verb involving in it the force of the causative affix णिच्.\n\nIt might be asked why was not the preposition उप read along with the other preposition in the last aphorism, instead of making this a separate _sutra_. The answer is that the necessity of making a separate _sutra_ with the preposition _upa_ arose from the exigencies of _sutra_ making. It is desired, that the next _sutra_ (I. 3. 85) should apply only to the root _upa_-_ram_, and not to other compounds of _ram_; and this could only be done by making these two distinct _sutras.",
    "13085": "The last aphorism ordained _parasmaipada_ absolutely. This declares an option under certain circumstances. As यावद्भुक्तमुपरमति or उपरमते, he desisted from or was quiet while it was eaten.",
    "13086": "By _sutra_ (I. 3. 74) _ante_, causatives took the _atmanepada_ termination when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This makes an exception to that and ordains _parasmaipada_. As बोधयति he expands ; योधयति he causes to fight; नाशयति he causes destruction, जनयति he begets, अध्यापयति he teaches; प्रावयति he causes to obtain; द्रावयति he causes to melt; श्रावयति he causes to trickle.\n\nOf the above eight roots, those which are intransitive would have taken the _parasmaipada_ terminations under the conditions mentioned in _sutra_ (I. 3. 88) sub, that is to say, when the agent is a being endowed with reason. The present aphorism in the case of such intransitive verbs makes this additional statement, that those intransitive verbs will take _parasmaipada_, even when the agent is not a being endowed with reason. As बोधयति पद्मम् he makes the lotus to expand, योधयति काष्ठानि he makes the woods to strike each other, नाशयति दुःखम् he destroys sorrow, जनयति सुखम् he produces pleasure.\n\nAgain of the above eight roots, those that have ordinarily the sense of \"moving\" will get _parasmaipada_ by _sutra_ (I. 3. 87). The present _sutra_, in their case makes this additional statement, that they will take _parasmaipada_ terminations even when the sense is not that of moving. Thus प्रु means both 'to move' and 'to obtain,' द्रु means 'to run' as well as 'to melt,' and स्रु means 'to flow' as well as to 'to trickle.' As प्रवते he obtains; अयोद्रवति the iron melts; कुण्डिका स्रवति the water-vessel drips. The examples in the first paragraph have therefore been thus translated.\n\nThe root इङ् is always compounded with अधि.",
    "13087": "The phrase 'when used in the causative (णेः) of the last _sutra_ is to be read into this also. The _parasmaipada_ is ordained as an exception to _sutra_ (I. 3. 74) by which _atmanepada_ was ordained when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. The word निगरणं means 'eating,' and चलनं means 'moving,' 'shaking.' As निगारयति he causes to swallow; आशयति he causes to eat; भोजयति he feasts; चलयति he moves; चोपयति, कम्पयति he shakens. This aphorism applies to transitive verbs, and to verbs whose agents in non-causative state are inanimate objects, i. e. not possessed with reason.\n\nVart:- The prohibition of the root अद to eat, must be mentioned. The causative of अद to eat, takes _atmanepada_. Thus अत्ति देवदत्तः _Devadatta_ eats; आदयते देवदत्तेन he is made to eat by _Devadatta_.",
    "13088": "The phrase णेः is understood here also. The _Atmanepada_ was ordained by _sutra_ (I. 3. 74) when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent. This aphorism is an exception to that, and ordains _parasmaipada_. As आस्ते देवदत्तः _Devadatta_ sits; आसयते देवदत्तं he makes _Devadatta_ to sit; शेते देवदत्तः _Devadatta_ sleeps ; शाययति देवदत्तं he causes _Devadatta_ to lie down.\n\nWhy do we say 'in its non-causal state'? For if the causative root is from another causative root, and not from a simple non-causative root, then the _parasmaipada_ will not be employed. Thus 'if one person such as _Devadatta_, causes another person _Yajnadatta_, to cause a third person _Ramadatta_, to do an act denoted by an intransitive root, as 'mounting' for instance, though _Ramadatta_ mounts for his own benefit, the verb to be used in such a case is आरोहयते, in the _Atmanepada_, from the root  आरुह to mount; and not आरोहयति. (_Lengar_'s Guide to _Panini_).\n\nWhy do we say 'which was intransitive'? This rule will not apply if the verb in its non-causative state was transitive. Thus from कारि the causative from कृ, if the person caused to do the act denoted by the verb does it for his own use, comes only कारयते though the person has a will; for the original root कृ though a non-causative root, is not an intransitive root.' (Ibid).\n\nWhy do we say 'having a being endowed with reason for its agent'? For if the agent is a non-sentient object, the verb will be _Atmanepadi_. Thus from शोषि the causative from शुष 'to dry' if that which dries is a thing not possessed of a will as व्रीहयः 'paddy,' for instance, though the fruit of the action, i.e., the drying, affects only the paddy itself, comes शोषयते in the _atmanepadi_, though 'to dry' is an intransitive root; e. g., शोषयते व्रीहीनातपः 'the sun-shine causes the paddy to dry.' (Ibid).",
    "13089": "The last two aphorisms had ordained _parasmaipada_ instead of _Atmanepada_, even when the fruit of the action accrued to the agent, thus debarring the latter's action which would otherwise have taken place by virtue of _sutra_ (I. 3. 74). This _sutra_ prohibits the last two _sutras_, and re-instates _Atmanepada_ of _sutra_ (I. 3. 74). Thus root पा to drink, has the sense of _nigarana_ or swallowing, the roots दम &c., have sentient beings as their agent; the root नृत् to dance has the sense of चलन or moving, but still these verbs have _atmanepada_ affixes, and do not take _parasmaipada_ in the causative. As पाययते he causes to drink, दमयते he causes to be tame, आयामयते he lengthens, आयासयते he troubles, परिमोहयते he entices, रोचयते he makes agreeable, नर्त्तयते he causes to dance, वादयते he makes to speak, वासयते he causes to dwell.\n\nVart:- The root धेट is should be enumerated along with पा &c. Thus धापयेते शिशुमेक समीची. The doe suckles a young infant.",
    "13090": "The affix क्यष is ordained by _sutra_ (III. 1. 12) भृशादिभ्यो भूव्यच् वेर्लोपश्च हलः after the words लोहित &c. These roots take optionally _parasmaipada_. As लोहितायति or ते he reddens. पटपटायति or ते he makes _pat_ _pat_.",
    "13091": "The _Dyutadi_ verbs are 22 in number, to be found in _Dhatupatha_ in the _Bhuadi_ class. By the use of the word द्युद्भ्यः in the plural in the _sutra_, the force is that of &c. These verbs are _anudatta_ and so by _sutra_ (I. 3. 12) they would have been invariably _atmanepadi_, this aphorism makes them optionally so in the aorist. Thus अद्युतत् or अद्योतिष्ठ he shone. In other tenses than the aorist (लुङ्) these verbs are invariably _Atmanepadi_. As द्योतते he shines.\n\nFor a list of _Dyutadi_ verbs see _Dhatupatha_.",
    "13092": "The वृतादि verbs are five in number and are included in the द्युतादि sub-class. They are वृत् to be, वृध् to grow, शृधू to fart or break wind; स्यन्दु to ooze, and कृपु to be able. As Ist Future वर्त्स्यति or वर्त्तिष्यते, it will be; conditional अवर्त्स्यत् or अवर्तिष्यत्; Desiderative विवृत्सति or विवर्त्तिषते &c.\n\nIn other tenses than the above, they are always _Atmanepadi_. As वर्त्तते it is.",
    "13093": "The verb क्लप् is one of the five verbs of the sub-class वृतादि of the last aphorism. Therefore it will take both _parasmaipada_ and _Atmanepada_, when the affixes स्य or सन follow. The present _sutra_ makes the additional declaration in the case of Ist Future or लुट. Thus in _Lut_ we have-- कल्प्तसि or कल्प्तासे thou wilt be; in Ist Future we have :- कल्पिष्यते or कल्प्स्यति he will be; in the Desiderative we have :- चिक्लृप्सति or चिकल्पिषते; in the conditional we have :- अकल्प्स्यत् or अकाल्पष्यत.",
    "14001": "What is that name then? That which comes last, where the claims are otherwise equal (I. 4. 2.) and that which were its claim disallowed, would have no other opportunity of conducing to any result, would be the recognised name. As a short vowel is called 'light' by (I. 4. 10.) and it is also called 'heavy' when it precedes a conjunct consonant (I. 4. 11). Thus a short vowel has two names 'light' and 'heavy.' But it will not be called 'light' when it precedes a conjunct consonant, but will have only one name, i.e. 'heavy.' Thus in भिद to divide छिद to split, the इ is 'light' while the same letter is 'heavy' in शिक्षा teaching भिक्षा begging.\n\nThus in the root तक्ष् the अ is 'heavy' and therefore in forming its aorist we have the form अततक्षत्. Similarly अररक्षत्. The rule (VII. 4. 93) not applying here as that rule is applicable to _laghu_ vowels only.",
    "14002": "The word विप्रतिषेधे means 'opposition of rules of equal force.' When two topics having different objects in view find scope of action simultaneously in one particular case, that opposition of equal forces is called _vipratishedha_. A general rule (_utsarga_) and its exception (_upavada_), or an invariable (_nitya_) and an optional (_anitya_) rule, or an _antaranga_ and a _bahiranga_ rule, are not rules of equal force. There the stronger prevails against the weaker. As an example of rules of equal force, see (VII. 3.102.) and (VII. 3. 103). The first rule declares, 'when a case-affix beginning with a letter of _yan_ _pratyahara_ follows, the long vowel is substituted for the final of an inflective base ending in a short अ.' As _Vriksha_ + _bhyam_ = _Vrikshabhyam_. The next rule declares :- When a plural case-affix beginning with a letter or _jhal_ _pratyahara_ follows, ए is the substitute for the final short अ of an inflective base.' As _Vriksha_ + _su_ = _Vriksheshu_. But when the plural case-affix _bhyah_ follows, what rule are we to apply? For the letter _bha_ belongs both to the _pratyaharas_ _yan_ and _jhal_. Are we to lengthen the short अ, or substitute ए? The present _sutra_ gives the reply, ए is to be substituted because (VII. 3. 103) ordaining ए follows next to (VII. 3. 102). Thus _Vriksha_ + _bhyah_ = _Vrikshebyah_.",
    "14003": "The word यू is compound of ई + ऊ The word _stryakhya_ means that which by itself denotes the name of a female. These words must be always feminine, having no masculine of the same form, as the word _gramani_ has. As the words _Kumari_ a virgin, यवागू, _yavaguh_ rice gruel. The declension of nouns of _nadi_ class is somewhat peculiar which will be treated of later. As see Rule (VII. 3. 112) आट् is the augment of the case-affixes having an indicatory ङ when they come after a word ending with a _Nadi_.\n\nWhy do we say ending in ई and ऊ ? Because feminine nouns not ending in these vowels will not be declined like _Nadi_ words. Thus while the dative of कुमारी will be कुमार्य्यै, the dative of दुहितृ will be दुहित्रे.\n\nWhy do we say 'which are feminine'? Because if they are names of males, they will not be called _Nadi_. As ग्रामणीः leader of a village; सेनानी leader of an army; खलपू a sweeper; their dative being ग्रामण्ये, सेनान्ये, खलप्ये.\n\nWhy have we used the word _akhya_ 'name' in the text? Because feminine gender must be denoted by the word itself and not by any other epithet used along with the word. Thus if the head-borough or the sweeper should be of the female sex, the Dative Singular would still be ग्रामण्ये स्त्रियै and खलप्वे स्त्रियै.",
    "14004": "The definition of _Nadi_ given in the last _sutra_ was rather too wide, this limits the scope. Thus श्री, happiness, भ्रू brow, admit the substitutes _iyan_ and _uvan_ respectively, and are not _nadi_. Their vocative singular is हे श्रीः, हे भ्रूः &c., while the vocative singular of _stri_ is हे स्त्रि.",
    "14005": "श्री + आम् = श्री इयङ् + आम् = श्रीयाम्; भ्रू + आम् = भ्रूवाम्; or श्री + आम् = श्रीनुट् + आम् (VII. 1. 54) = श्रीणाम्; भ्रू + आम् = भ्रूणाम्. But _stri_ is always _nadi_. and we have स्त्रीणाम् _strinam_.\n\nTo the absolute prohibition enjoined by the last _sutra_, this allows an option in the case of Genitive Plural.",
    "14006": "Feminine words in long _i_ and _u_ have been defined as _nadi_, words in short vowels can never be termed _nadi_, while even some words in long vowels have also been excluded from the scope of the definition if they take _iyan_ and _uvan_ The present _sutra_ declares an option in the case of all the above words, when a case-affix having an indicatory ङ follows.\n\nThe case-affixes having an indicatory _n_ are the Dative, Ablative. Genitive and Locative singulars. Thus we have:--\n\nDative मतये or मत्यै, धेनवे or धेन्वै, श्रिये or श्रियै; Ablative and Genitive मतेः or मत्याः, धेनो or धेन्वाः, श्रियः or श्रियाः;  Locative मतौ or मत्याम्, धेनौ or धेन्वां, श्रियि or श्रियां. So also भ्रुवै or भ्रुवे & c. But _stri_ is always स्त्र्यै &c.",
    "14007": "This defines the word _ghi_. The peculiarity of the declension of _ghi_ words will be treated later on. The word _hrasva_ is understood in this _sutra_. The word _sesha_ or 'the rest' implies 'the words ending in short इ or उ which are not the names of females, or if they are feminine names, they are not _nadi_ words.'\n\nAs अग्नि fire. Before case affixes having an indicatory _n_, the _ghi_ nouns _gunate_ there vowel (VII. 3. 111). As अग्नि + ङे = अग्ने + ए = अग्नये to the fire. So also  वायु + ङे = वायवे to the wind. But the declension of _sakhi_ in these cases is :- सख्या सख्ये सख्यु and सख्यौ.",
    "14008": "The word _pati_ would have been _ghi_ by the last _sutra_; the present _sutra_ is therefore a _niyama_ rule, restricting the use of _ghi_ in the case of _pati_ to its occurring in composition. The word _eva_ 'only' is used in a restrictive sense.\n\nAs पत्या by the lord but प्रजापतिना by the lord of creatures. So also पत्ये and प्रजापतये; पत्युः and प्रजापतेः, पत्यौ and प्रजापतौ &c. When पति is _ghi_, there is _guna_ of the vowel before the four ङित् affixes by (VII. 3. 111).",
    "14009": "The word _pati_ is understood in this _sutra_. By the last _sutra_, _pati_ would have not been _ghi_ when not in composition. This _sutra_ makes an exception to that when this word occurs in the _Vaidic_ literature.\n\nकुलुञ्चानां पतये or पत्ये नमः salutation to the lord of the _Kulunchas_.\n\nWhy do we say 'when used in connection with a noun in the genitive case'? Observe मया पत्या जरट्टषिर्यथासः.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the _Chhandas_'? Observe ग्रामस्य पत्ये.",
    "14010": "This defines the word _Laghu_. A _hrasva_ vowel which has already been defined (I. 2. 27), is under certain circumstances called _laghu_ or 'light'; thus the _i_ of भिद to break, is _laghu_, and by being _laghu_ it is _gunated_ before the affix ता + आ, as भेत्ता he will break, by virtue of the rule (VII 3. 86), which declares that a _laghu_ penultimate vowel is _gunated_ before a _Sarvadhatuka_ or an _ardhadhatuka_ affix. So also छेत्ता, अचीकरत् and अजीहरत्.",
    "14011": "A _hrasva_ vowel however is not to be called 'light' when it is followed by a conjunct consonant. As the _i_ of शिक्षा 'learning' is a heavy vowel. Thus शिक्षा is derived from शिक्ष + अ (III. 3. 103), (let the affix अ come after that verb which has a heavy vowel and ends in a consonant when the word to be formed is feminine). So also कुण्डा and भिक्षा.",
    "14012": "This is clear the _anuvritti_ of the word conjunct is not understood in this _sutra_. As _i_ of ईहांचक्रे he endeavoured, ईक्षांचक्रे he saw. Here the letter ई is _guru_, and because of its being called _guru_, the rule (III. 1. 36) is applied in forming the perfect tense by the addition of the augment आस्. Thus all long vowels, and short vowels followed by conjunct consonants are _guru_ or heavy. All other short vowels are _laghu_.",
    "14013": "The words of this _sutra_ require some explanation. _Yasmat_ after whatsoever; _pratyaya_-_vidhih_ compound of _pratyaya_ meaning an affix and _vidhih_, a precept i.e. a rule enjoying an affix; _tadadi_, I. S. that which begins therewith _pratyaye_ 7. S. = in a _pratyaya_ i.e. when a _pratyaya_ follows (1. 1.) is called a base.\n\nAfter whatsoever there is an affix enjoined, whether it be a verbal root (_Dhatu_) or a nominal base (_pratipadika_), the word-form having that as its beginning, is called an _anga_, with regard to the affix that follows. The word _yasmat_ is used in the aphorism to point out the thing named, as _anga_; because the word _tadadi_ follows it. This defines the word _anga_. The word 'base' is thus a relative term with regard to its affix. Thus कृ + ता = कर्ता he will do हर्ता he will lose. करिष्यति, हरिष्यति. Here because the root कृ and हृ gets the name अंग they are _gunated_ by (VII. 3. 84). Similarly because उपगु &c. get the name _Anga_, their vowel is _vriddhied_ in औपगवः &c.\n\nThe words _kri_ _hri_ are _anga_ with regard to the affix _ta_ &c. उपगु + अण् = औपगवः; कापटवः. Here _upagu_ and _kapatu_ are _anga_ with regard to _an_. Similarly कृ + स्य + वः = करिष्य + वः = करिष्यावः. Here the whole word form _Karishya_ is regarded as _anga_, and as such the short _a_ is lengthened by (VII. 3. 101); because though the affix _vah_ is enjoined after the word _kri_, the form which begins with _kri_ i.e. _karishya_ will also be called _anga_ when the affix is to be added. The word _tadadi_, therefore, has been used in the _sutra_, to make the definition of _Anga_ applicable to the forms which a word may assume after taking the intermediate affixes like _sya_ &c., or नुम् before the final affixes. Thus कुण्ड + नुम् + इ = कुण्डन् + इ = कुण्डानि (VII. 1. 72) and (VI. 4. 8) _kunda_ + _num_ + _i_ = _kundan_ +_i_  = _kundani_, bowls. Here the whole form _kundan_ is called _anga_, and as such it lengthens its vowel before the case-affix _i_ by (VI. 4. 8).\n\nWhy have we used the word _pratyaya_? Without it the rule would have run thus :- 'After whatever there is anything enjoined &c., is called _Anga_.' Then in स्त्री + इयती = स्त्रयती. Here _sandhi_ of vowels is enjoined between ई + इ = ई. If स्त्री was here an _Anga_, then its last last vowel would have been replaced by इयङ् (VI. 4. 77), the form being स्त्रियियति.\n\nWhy have we used the word विधि ? Had we omitted it the rule would have run thus:-- \"After whatsoever there is an affix, whether root or _pratipadika_ is _Anga_.\" Thus in दधि अधुना, though the affix _adhuna_ is placed after the word _dadhi_, it is not enjoined by any rule, and the word दधि is not called _anga_. Had it been so called, then the इ of _dadhi_ should have been elided by rule (VI. 4. 148).\n\nThe word _pratyaya_ has been repeated twice in this _sutra_ in order to show that when an affix is elided, the term _anga_ will not apply to what stood before it. Thus in the compound word स्त्रियै + अर्थं = स्त्र्यर्थं for the sake of the woman. Here in forming the _Tatpurusha_ compound the dative case-affix after the word स्त्री has been elided, for as a general rule case-affixes are elided in forming compounds. If the word स्त्री after its affix had been elided, still retained its old designation of _Anga_, the स्त्री + अर्थं would have been स्त्रियर्थं, the augment _iyan_ being added by the rule already referred to above.",
    "14014": "The _sup_ or case-affixes are those by which nouns are declined; and _tin_ are tense-affixes by which verbs are conjugated. They have already been given before. Thus ब्राह्मण + जस् = ब्राह्मणाः the _Brahmanas_ पचन्ति they cook.\n\nIt might be asked by a caviller why the word अन्त has been used in the aphorism, for by the rule of _tadanta_ given in _Sutra_ (I. 1. 72) a rule relating to _sup_ will mean and include also that which ended with a _sup_-affix. To this we reply, that the very fact that the word _anta_ is used in this _sutra_, indicates by implication (_jnapaka_) that the _Tadanta_ rule of _Sutra_ 72 Chapter I does not apply to rules of _sanjna_ (definition) made with regard to affixes. Thus _tarap_ and _tamap_ affixes are called _gha_ by _Sutra_ (I. 1. 22). The _tadanta_-_vidhi_ will not apply here; words ending with these affixes will not be called _gha_. Thus ब्राह्मणितरा will not be called _gha_, for had it been so called, the long ई will be shortened in गौरी ब्राह्मणितरा. In short, 'an affix when employed in a rule which teaches the meaning of a technical term (_sanjna_) does not denote a word-form ending with the affix.'",
    "14015": "These are affixes by which denominative verbs are formed from nouns. See (III.1. 8), (III.1. 11), and (III.1. 13). A word ending in न is called _pada_, when these affixes follow. Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राजीय 3rd Per. 8. राजीयति he behaves like a king. So also राजन् + क्यङ् = राजायते (VII. 4. 5.) चर्मन् + क्यष् = चर्मायते or चर्मायति. The result of its being called _pada_ is that the न् of राजन्, चर्मन् &c., is elided by _Sutra_ (VIII. 2. 7). (there is elision of न् final in a _pada_ which is entitled to the designation of _pratipadika_). Thus राजन् + क्यच् = राज + य = राजीय (VII. 4. 33).\n\nThese three affixes क्यच् &c., come after case-inflected words (i.e., words ending in _sup_), and though, before these affixes, the case terminations are elided, still by _Sutra_ (I. 1. 62) such words would have retained the name of _pada_ which they got by Rule 14 of this Chapter. The present _sutra_ however makes a restriction (_niyama_). It declares that only words ending in न् retain the name of _pada_; while all other case-inflected words before these affixes do not retain that designation. Thus the words वाच् speech, स्रुच् a ladle are not treated as _pada_ and we have वाच्यते and स्रुच्यते. Had they been _pada_, the च् would have been changed into क् by (VIII. 2. 30).",
    "14016": "The sutra 18 of this chapter teaches that before certain affixes, the preceding word is called _bha_. This _sutra_ declares an exception to that by anticipation. Thus Rule (IV. 2. 115) declares: -- \"Affixes ठक् and छस् come after the _vriddha_ (I. 1. 74) word भवत्.\" Here the affix छस् has an indicatory स्, therefore the word भवत्, standing before it, will be called _pada_. Thus भवत् + छस् = भवदीयः (VII. 1. 2), belonging to you. The result of being _pada_ is that ते is changed into द (VIII 2. 39). Similarly स् is इत् in युस् (After the word _urna_ there is _yus_ (V. 2 123). Thus ऊर्णायुः; so also घस् (V. 1. 106), has स् as indicatory. Thus ॠत्वियः There is no _guna_ because of its being _pada_",
    "14017": "The affixes beginning with _su_ and ending with _kap_ are meant by the above _sutra_. Thus the case-affix भ्याम् (Ins Dual) is an affix included in the above. Thus राजन् + भ्याम् = राजभ्याम्, राजभिः, राजत्वं, राजता, राजतरः, राजतमः The न is elided by being _pada_.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not a _Sarvanamasthana_'? Observe राजन् + औ = राजानौ two kings. kings. राजानः kings. The न is not elided.",
    "14018": "This debars the application of _pada_. Thus गर्ग + यञ् (IV. 1. 105) = गार्ग्यः a grandson of _Garga_. So also वात्स्यः. The affix _yan_ begins with a _ya_ and the word _garga_ being treated as _Bha_ its final अ is elided before the affix by (VI. 4. 148).\n\nSo also दक्ष + इञ् = दाक्षिः (IV. 1. 95) grandson of _Daksha_ प्लाक्षिः. Here the affix इञ् begins with a vowel the word standing before it being _Bha_, it causes elision of the final अ of _daksha_.\n\nThe word यचि is in the 7th case meaning when य् or अच् follow; and by the last _Vart_ of _Sutra_ (I. 1. 72), it means 'when an affix beginning with _ya_ or _ach_ follow.'\n\nVart:- The words नभस्, अङ्गिरस् and मनुष् should be treated as _Bha_ when the affix वत् follows. Thus नभस्वत् like the sky. अङ्गिरस् like the _Angiras_. मनुष्वत् like the man. By being _Bha_, the स् is not changed into र्, which it would have been, had it been a _pada_ (VIII. 2. 66).\n\nVart:- The words वृषन् is treated as _Bha_ in the vedas when the words वसु and अश्व follow. Thus वृषण्वसुः; वृषणश्वस्य मेने Here had the word _vrishan_ been treated as _pada_, the न would not have been changed into ण (See Rule (VIII. 4. 37)); and this न would have been dropped before the affix _vasu_ by (VIII. 2. 7).",
    "14019": "The word _Bha_ is understood in this _sutra_. Thus is the word उदश्वित्वत् having butter milk Nom. Sing. उदश्वित्वान् पोषः the herdsman having butter milk, विद्युत्वान् बलाहकः the cloud full of thunder. So also यशस्वी famous; पयस्वी full of milk. Thus उदश्वित् + वतुप् = उदश्वित्वत्, यशस् + विनि (V. 2. 121) = यशस्विन्. By making these _Bha_, the operation of _pada_ rule is debarred in their case. That is to say the त of _udasvit_ &c., and the स् of _yasas_ &c., are not changed into द and र respectively, which had they been _pada_ words would have been the case by the action of _Sutra_ (VIII. 2. 39), and (VIII. 2. 66). viz., उदश्विद्वत् and यशोविन् which are incorrect.",
    "14020": "These words being taught here in the topic relating to _pada_ and _Bha_, show that they have been properly forced in the _chhandas_ by the application of the rules of _Bha_ and _pada_. Thus अयस् + मय = अयस्मय made of iron. Here the word अयस् is treated as _Bha_ and hence the स् is not changed into र. Thus अयस्मयं वर्म iron-made coat of mail. अयस्मयानि पात्राणि iron vessels. The present form of this word is अयोमयं. In some places both these _pada_ and _Bha_ apply simultaneously. Thus in the word ॠक्वत् formed by ऋच् + वत्, the च् is first changed into क् by treating the word rich as a _pada_. Then the word ॠक् is treated as _Bha_, and therefore the क् is not changed into ग् before वत्. For had it been _pada_, the form would have been ॠग्वत् _Rigvat_. These irregularly formed words occur only in the _chhandas_ or Vedic literature. Thus स सुष्टुभास ऋक्वता गणेन.",
    "14021": "When it is intended to denote multeity those affixes should be employed after nouns and verbs, which denote plural number. Thus ब्राह्मणाः पठन्ति, The _Brahmins_ read.\n\nThis rule applies to words which are capable of expressing numbers. Indeclinables (_Avyaya_) do not admit of numbers, and consequently they are always in singular number which is the general form.",
    "14022": "This is also clear. When duality is to be expressed, a dual case-affix should be employed, and in the case of unit, the singular case-affix. Thus ब्राह्मणौ पचतः the two _Brahmins_ cook. ब्राह्मणः पचति the _Brahmin_ cooks.",
    "14023": "Any thing that helps towards the accomplishment of an action is a _karaka_. Thus in 'cooking,' the fire, the furnace, the vessel, the cook are all helpers in the accomplishment of the action. Thus '_Rama_ cooks food in a vessel, by the fire from the furnace for his master.' Here _Rama_ is agent _karaka_; 'food' is object _karaka_; 'vessel' is a locative _karaka_, fire is an instrumental _karaka_, 'furnace' is the ablative _karaka_ and 'master' is the dative _karaka_.\n\nThe word '_karaka_' thus is synonymous with the word cause (_hetu_) and occasion (_nimitta_). All the various causes and the occasions that are required to complete an action will be _karakas_. Out of the seven cases in which a sanskrit noun is declined, six represent such relation with an action. The Genitive or the sixth case can never be directly related with an action, and thus can never stand in the relation of a _karaka_ to a verb.",
    "14024": "This defines the Ablation or _Apadana_ _karaka_. Thus ग्रामादागच्छति he comes from the village. पर्वतादवरोहति he descends from the mountain. स्वार्थाद्धीनः lost his object. रथात् पतितः fallen from the chariot. The _Apadana_ takes the 5th case-affix (II. 3 28) and the above examples show this. When therefore this relation is to be expressed, 'the fixed point (like _grama_, _purvata_ &c., in the above) which is the limit denoted by a word dependent on a verb, is called ablation.'\n\nVart:- The objects of verbs denoting 'aversion,' 'cessation' and 'negligence' are also called ablation. Thus:- अधर्माञ्जुगुप्सते he dislikes injustice; अधर्माद्विरमति he ceases from injustice. धर्मात्प्रमाद्यति he neglects justice.",
    "14025": "The verbs signifying 'fear' or 'protection' govern the object feared of, or the danger to be protected from, in the ablative case. Thus चौरेभ्यो बिभेति he is afraid of thieves, चौरेभ्य उद्विजते he is agitated because of the thieves. चौरेभ्यस्त्रायते or रक्षति. He protects or saves from the thieves.\n\nWhy do we say 'the cause of fear (_bhaya_-_hetu_) is put in the ablative case'? Observe अरण्ये बिभेति or त्रायते he fears or protects in the forest.",
    "14026": "When the verb जि to conquer, with the preposition _para_ has the sense of 'becoming tired or unbearable' it governs the ablative case of the thing become unbearable. As अध्ययनात् पराजयते he finds study unbearable.\n\nWhy do we say 'that which becomes unbearable.' Observe शत्रून् पराजयते he defeats the enemies.",
    "14027": "The obstruction to one's natural inclination is called _varana_ or prevention. As यवेभ्यो गां वारयति or निवर्तयति he wards off or withholds the cow from the barley.\n\nWhy do we say 'the object desired' is put in the ablative case' ? Observe गां वारयति क्षेत्रे he wards off the cow in the field.",
    "14028": "Thus उपाध्यायादन्तर्धत्ते or निलीयते he conceals or hides from the teacher; so that the teacher may not find him out or see him.\n\nWhy do we say 'when concealment is indicated'? Observe चौरात् न दिदृक्षते he does not wish to see the thieves. Here the term _chauran_ is in the accusative case.\n\nWhy has the word _ichchhati_ been used in the text? The _apadana_ _karaka_ is to be used there only, where one desires that he should not be seen, yet he shows himself.",
    "14029": "The word आख्याता means teacher, and उपयोग means acquiring knowledge in the regular way. Thus उपाध्यायादधीते or आगमयति he learns from the preceptor.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to learn'? Observe नटस्य शृणोति he hears the player.",
    "14030": "That which is the Agent (कर्ता) of the verb _jan_, is called जनिकर्ता. That which is the prime-cause (प्रकृति) of the agent (or product) of the root _jan_ is put in the ablative case. As शृङ्गाच्छरो जायते, the arrow is produced from horn गोमयाद् वृश्चिको जायते the scorpion is produced from cowdung.",
    "14031": "The phrase 'of the agent (_kartuh_)' is understood here. The word प्रभव means the source or that from which anything arises. As हिमवतो गंगा प्रभवति the Ganges has its source in the _Himalayas_. काश्मीरेभ्यो वितस्ता प्रभवति. The Hydaspes has its source in _Cashmere_.",
    "14032": "Though the word कर्मणा in the _sutra_ is indefinitely used, meaning 'with the object' yet it is not every object of any verb. The object must be of the verb 'to give.'\n\nAs उपाध्यायाय गां ददाति he gives the cow to the teacher. माणवकाय भिक्षान् ददाति he gives alms to the boy. Here the words 'cow' and 'alms' are the object of the verb 'give'; the persons connected with this object are the teacher and the boy respectively. These latter are in the Dative case and take the 4th case-affix.\n\nVart:- The person whom one wishes to connect with the action should also be called recipient. As श्राद्धाय निगर्हते he censures for the sake of _Sraddha_. युद्धाय सनह्यते he prepares for battle. पत्ये शेते she sleeps for her husband.\n\nVart:- 2. After some verbs (especially to sacrifice), the object (_karma_) gets the name of Instrument (_karana_) and the recipient (_Sampradana_) is called object (_karma_).\n\nThus पशुना रुद्रं यजते or पशुं रुद्राय ददाति he sacrifices with an animal to _Rudra_, which is equivalent to, 'he gives an animal to _Rudra_.'",
    "14033": "The verbs having similar meaning (_artha_) as the word _ruchi_ or 'liking' are रुच्यर्थ. A desire or longing caused by something else, is called _ruchi_. As देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः the sweet meat pleases _Devadatta_. यज्ञदत्ताय स्वदते ऽपूपः _Yajnadatta_ likes _Apupa_. Here _modaka_ is the agent that draws out the longing which is latent in _Devadatta_.\n\nWhy do we say 'the person pleased'? Observe देवदत्ताय रोचते मोदकः पथि. _Devadatta_ likes _modak_ in the way. The word _pathi_ being in the 7th case.",
    "14034": "The word ज्ञीप्स्यमान means whom it is desired to make known or inform. As देवदत्ताय श्लाघते he praises _Devadatta_, i.e., while praising _Devadatta_, he wishes that he should know this praise. So also with other verbs. As देवदत्ताय ह्नुते he hides from (wishing that _Devadatta_ should know of it) _Devadatta_, देवदत्ताय तिष्ठते she offers herself to _Devadatta_ (for sexual embrace, wishing that he should know of it). देवदत्ताय शपते he reviles _Devadatta_.\n\nWhy do we say 'the person whom it is intended to inform'? Observe देवदत्ताय श्लाघति पथि. Here _pathi_ is in the Locative case.",
    "14035": "The word उत्तमर्ण is compounded of two words उत्तम best and ऋण debt meaning (whose debt is best) creditor, as opposed to अधमर्ण debtor. As देवदत्ताय शतं धारयति he owes hundred to _Devadatta_.\n\nWhy do we say 'the creditor is called Recipient'? Observe देवदत्ताय शतं धारयति ग्रामे he owes hundred to _Devadatta_ in the village. Here village is in the Locative case.",
    "14036": "The verb स्पृह to desire, belongs to the _churadi_ class. The word governed by this verb takes the Dative case. As पुष्पेभ्यः स्पृहयति he desires flowers, फलेभ्यः स्पृहयति he desires fruits.\n\nWhy do we say 'the thing desired.' Observe पुष्पेभ्यो वने स्पृहयति he desires flowers in the forest. Here वने is in the Locative case.",
    "14037": "_Krudh_ means non-tolerance, _droha_ means doing wrong or hurt, _irshya_ jealousy; and _asuya_ means to find out the faults of another. The word _kopa_ includes all the above four sorts of actions. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति-द्रुह्यति-ईर्ष्यति or असूयति he is angry upon, (i. e. with) or bears malice to, or is jealous of, or finds out the faults of _Devadatta_. Here _Devadatta_ is in the Dative case.\n\nWhy do we say 'against whom the feeling of anger is directed.' Be if there be no feeling of anger, then these verbs will not govern the dative case, but the accusative. Thus भार्यामीर्ष्यति he is jealous of his wife, i.e., does not wish her to be seen by others. Here the word _bharya_ is in the accusative case.",
    "14038": "This aphorism is a proviso to the last, and enjoins accusative case, where by the last, there would have been dative. The word _upasrishta_ means having _upasarga_ or preposition. As देवदत्तमभिक्रुध्यति अभिद्रुह्यति. When used simply, those verbs of course govern the Dative case by the last aphorism. As देवदत्ताय क्रुध्यति.",
    "14039": "The word _viprasna_ means literally asking various questions; and denotes questioning about the good or bad luck of another. Thus देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते गर्गः _Garga_ is favorable to or looks to _Devadatta_, the sense is that being casually asked by _Devadatta_, he reflects upon the good or bad fortune of _Devadatta_.\n\nAnother explanation of this _sutra_ is, the agent that puts various questions is put in the dative case, As शिष्याय राध्नोति or ईक्षते वा गुरुः meaning, the pupil asks the teacher various questions to resolve his doubts, and the teacher answers those questions to the pupil.",
    "14040": "The compound verb प्रतिश्रू and आश्रू means to promise. A promise is made on the motion or at the instance of another. The person so proposing who was the agent of the former action becomes the recipient of the promise in the latter case. As देवदत्ताय गां प्रतिशृणोति--आशृणोति he promises a cow to _Devadatta_.",
    "14041": "The phrase _purvasya_ _karta_ of the last is to be read into this aphorism. As होत्रे ऽनुगृणाति. They encourage the _Hotri_, i.e. the _Hotri_ priest invokes first, the others then follow him in invocation and by so doing encourage him. The word अनुगरः and प्रतिगरः mean encouraging the invoker.",
    "14042": "A दात्रेण लुनाति he cuts with the sickle. परशुना छिनत्ति he divides by the axe. The instrument कारक takes the third-case affix.\n\nWhy do we say 'especially'? Because in the case of the other _karakas_, the non-mention of the word 'especially' makes it possible for us to use those cases, in not their strict sense. Thus though the locative case should be used where strictly a thing is located in another, yet we may say गङ्गायां घोषः the herdsman in the Ganges, not strictly in, but on the banks of, the Ganges. कूपे गर्गकुलम् the family of frogs in the well, i.e. on the sides of the well.",
    "14043": "The present _sutra_ ordains accusative case, where by the operation of the last aphorism there ought to have been Instrumental case. The force of च in the _sutra_ is to indicate that _karana_ is also to be read into this. As अक्षात् दीव्यति or अक्षै र्दीव्यति he plays the dice or with the dice.",
    "14044": "This ordains dative case, where there would otherwise have been Instrumental case. The word परिक्रयणे means to engage for a limited period on payment of wages, and not absolute purchase for all time. As शताय परिक्रीतो ऽनुब्रूहि शतेन परिक्रीतो ऽनुब्रूहि.",
    "14045": "That in which the action is supported or located is called _adhara_. As कटे आस्ते he is seated on the mat. कटे शेते he is sleeping on the mat. स्थाल्यां पचति he cooks in the pot. The _Adhikarana_ takes the 7th case-affix.",
    "14046": "This ordains accusative case, where otherwise by the last _sutra_ there would have been the Locative case. As ग्राममधिशेते अधितिष्ठति or अध्यास्ते he lies down, occupies or lies in the village.",
    "14047": "As ग्राममभिनिविशते he resorts to the village. This is an optional rule, as the word \"option\" of _sutra_ (I. 4. 44) should be read into it. Thus we have the following forms also पापेऽभिनिवेशः resorting to sin. कल्याणेऽभिनिवेशः resorting to good. The rule here is that of _vyavasthita_ _vibhasa_.",
    "14048": "As ग्राममुपवसति सेना the army dwells in the village पर्वतमुपवसति-अनुवसति अधिवसति or आवसति.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when the verb वस् means \"fasting,\" or does not denote lying in a locality. As ग्रामे उपवसति he fasts in the village. Here the verb _upavasati_ governs the locative case and not the accusative.",
    "14049": "That which is especially desired by the agent to be accomplished by the action is called _karma_. As कटं करोति He makes the mat. ग्रामं गच्छति he goes to the village. Why do we say \"desired by the agent\"? Observe माषेष्व श्वं बध्नाति he ties the horse in the gram field. Here gram is no doubt most desired by the horse, but as the horse is not the agent of the verb, the word माष takes the locative case. Why do we use the word \"most\"? Observe पयसौदनं भुङ्क्ते he eats the food along with the milk. Here milk is me doubt desired by the agent, but not being the principal object desired, takes the Instrumental case.\n\nThough the word कर्म was understood in this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from the last _sutra_, the repetition of this word here is to indicate that the _anuvritti_ of the word _adhara_ does not extend to this _sutra_, because as we do not take the _anuvritti_ of the word _karma_ into this _sutra_, we do not take the _anuvritti_ of any word of the previous _sutra_ into this. Had we taken the _anuvritti_ of the word _karma_ from the last _sutra_, then we could use the accusative case in those limited instances, where the word is capable of taking the Locative case also, but not in other cases. Thus while we could very well say गेहं प्रविशति he enters the house, we could not say ओदनं पचति he cooks the food, सक्तुं पिबति he drinks _saktu_. By repeating the word _karma_ in this _sutra_, such examples become valid everywhere. The _karma_-_karaka_, takes the second case-affix.",
    "14050": "That which is not desired by the agent is _anipsita_ or object of aversion. Thus विषं भक्षयति he eats poison, चोरात् पश्यति. He sees the thieves. ग्रामम् गच्छन् वृक्षमूला न्युपसर्पति going to the village, he plucks the roots of the trees.",
    "14051": "There are some verbs in Sanskrit which take what is called an _akathita_ object, in addition to their usual direct one. As its name indicates, it is that object which is not otherwise _kathita_ or mentioned by way of any of the other case relations, such as अपादान अधिकरण &c. and is, therefore optional. If the noun capable of taking this _akathita_ object be not intended for any other case, it is put in the Accusative case with such verbs; as, धेनुं दोग्धि पयः he milks the cow (her milk) व्रजमवरुणद्धि गां 'he confines the cow to the fold.' Here धेनुं and व्रजं are _akathita_ or optional objects. If the speaker does not intend to have this object, the words will be put in their natural cases; as, धेन्वाः (ablative), पयोदोग्धि, व्रजे (locative) अवरुणद्धि गां.\n\nThe roots that are capable of governing two accusatives are mentioned in the following _karika_:-- दुह्याच् पच् दण्ड् रुधि प्रच्छि चि ब्रू शासु जि मन्थ् मुषाम् ॥ कर्मयुक् स्यादकथितं तथा स्या न्नी हृ कृष् वहाम् ॥\n\nIn the case of the roots दुह् 'to milk' याच् 'to beg,' पच् 'to cook,' दण्ड् 'to punish,' रुध् 'to obstruct or confine' प्रच्छ् 'to ask,' चि 'to collect' ब्रू 'to tell' शास् 'instruct' जि 'to win' (as a prize of wager) मन्थ् 'to churn' मुष् 'to steal,' and also in the case of नी, हृ, कृष्, and वह all meaning 'to take or carry' and others having the same signification, that noun which, besides the direct object, is affected by the verb, is put in the Accusative case; as, गां दोग्धि पयः (S. K.) 'he milks the cow'; बलिं याचते वसुधां. He begs the earth of _Bali_; similarly तंडुलानोदनं पचति, गर्गाञ् शतं दण्डयति, व्रजमवरुणद्धि गां, माणवकं पंथानं पृच्छति, वृक्षमवचिनोति फलानि, माणवकं धर्मं ब्रूते-शास्तिवा, शतं जयति देवदत्तं, सुधां क्षीरनिधिं मथ्नाति, देवदत्तं शतं मुष्णाति; ग्राममजां नयति-हरति-कर्षति-वहति वा are examples of the other roots in order. माणवकं धर्मं भाषते वक्ति वा, बलिं वसुधां भिक्षते, तां त्वां संवरणस्यार्थे वरयामि विभावसो are instances of this kind of object, because भाष् or वाच् and भिक्ष् or वृ have the same meaning as ब्रू and वाच्, the roots given in the _Kasika_.\n\nObs.-- The roots चि, मुष्, पच् मंथ्, रुध्, जि, कृष् हृ and ever वह् are of every rare occurrence as governing two accusatives, in the classical literature, though given in the above list.\n\nThe roots mentioned above and others having the same sense, take two objects. One of them is principal, and the other, secondary. In the case of the first twelve roots from दुह् to मुष्, the nouns पयः, वसुधां, फलानि, सुधां, &c. are principal objects, and गां, बलिं, वृक्षं, क्षीरनिधिं &c. are secondary objects, for they can, according to the speaker's volition, be put in other cases. And in the case of the last four roots अजा, is the principal object and ग्रामं the secondary. Thus that which is necessarily put in the accusative case in order to complete the idea of the verb, is the principal object, and that which may be put in the Accusative case, depending upon the speaker's will, is called the secondary object.",
    "14052": "In the case of the roots that imply 'motion,' 'knowledge' or 'information' or some kind of 'eating,' and other roots having a similar sense; also of roots that have some literary work for their object, and of intransitive roots, that which is the subject of the verb in its primitive sense is put in the Accusative case in the causal, the object remaining unchanged; e. g.\n\n- PRIMITIVE - शत्रवः स्वर्गमगच्छन्, CAUSAL - शत्रून् स्वर्गमगमयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - स्वे वेदार्थमविदुः, CAUSAL - स्वान् वेदार्थम् अवेदयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - देवा अमृतमाश्नन्, CAUSAL - देवानमृतमाशयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - विधिर्वेदध्यैत, CAUSAL - विधिं वेदमध्यापयत् ।\n- PRIMITIVE - पृथ्वी सलिले आस्त, CAUSAL - पृथ्वीं सलिले आसयत् ।\n\nBut in गमयति रामो गोविन्दं (_Rama_ makes _Govind_ go) if some body else (विष्णु मित्र) prompts _Rama_ to do this, we shall have to say, विष्णुमित्रो रामेण गोविन्दं गमयति '_Vishnu_ _mitra_ prompts _Rama_ to cause _Govind_ to go.' Here '_Rama_' is not put in the Accusative case, because it is the subject of the Verb, not in its primitive, but causal, sense. _Patanjali_, in his _Mahabhashya_, adds this explanation on the meaning of the word शब्दकर्म in the _sutra_ गतिबुद्धि &c. शब्दकर्म may be either शब्दो येषां क्रिया or शब्दो येषं कर्म.\n\nWhen we take the former interpretation, the roots ह्वयति (ह्वे) क्रंदति (क्रंद) and शब्दायते (denom. of शब्द) have to be excluded from the rule; as, ह्वयति देवदत्तः हाययति देवदत्तेन; क्रंदति-शब्दायते-देवदत्तः; क्रंदयति-शब्दाययति-देवदत्तेन. And the roots श्रु, ज्ञा with वि and लभ् with उप must be included in the rule; as, शृणोति विजानाति-उपलभते-देवदत्तः श्रावयति-विज्ञापयति-उपलंभयति-देवदत्तम्. When we adopt the second interpretation, the roots जल्प्, भाष् with आ and लप with वि, must be included in the rule; हल्पति-विलपति-आभाषते-देवदत्तः, जल्पयति-विलापयति-आभाषयति-देवदत्तं.\n\nThere are several exceptions and counter-exceptions to the preceding rule, which are important.\n\nVart:- The causals of नी 'to lead' and वह् 'to carry,' do not govern the Accusative, but the Instrumental; e. g. भृत्यो भारं नयति वहति वा A servant carries a load. भृत्येन भारं नाययति वाहयति वा (_Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_) (He) causes a servant to carry a load.\n\nVart:- But वह्, when it has for its subject in the causal a word signifying a 'driver,' obeys the general rule; as, वाहा रथं वहन्ति. Horses draw the chariot. वहंति यवान् वलीवर्दाः.\n\nVart:- (b). The causals of the roots अद् and खाद्, 'to eat,' govern the Instrumental case; e.g. वटुरन्नमत्ति खादति वा. The boy eats his food. वटुनान्नमादयति खादयति वा. (He) causes the boy to eat his food.\n\nVart:- (c). भक्ष्, when it has not the sense of हिंसा 'injury to a sentient thing,' governs the Instrumental; as, भक्षयति पिंडीं देवदत्तः, भक्षयति पिंडीं देवदत्तेन; but भक्षयति यवान् बलीवर्दाः, भक्षयति वली वर्दान् यवान्.\n\nBy 'intransitive' roots mentioned above is meant such roots as are not by their nature capable of governing an object other than that of 'time,' 'place' &c., and not those roots which, though transitive, may sometimes be used intransitively according to the speaker's volition, or when their meaning is, quite evident; as, किंकरः पचरः पचति. Here पचति, though transitive, is used without an object, because it can be easily understood; hence किंकरेण पाचयति and not किंकरं; but मासमासयति देवदत्तं.\n\nIn forming the passive construction of causal verbs, the principal object in the causal, which is the subject (agent) of the verb in its primitive sense, is put in the Nominative case, and the other object remains unchanged; e. g.\n\n- PRIMITIVE - रामो ग्रामं गच्छति., CAUSAL ACTIVE - रामं ग्रामं गमयति., CAUSAL PASSIVE - रामो ग्रामं गम्यते ।\n- PRIMITIVE - _Rama_ goes to a village., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He) causes _Rama_ to go to a village., CAUSAL PASSIVE - _Rama_ is caused to go &c.\n- PRIMITIVE - भृत्यः कटं करोति, CAUSAL ACTIVE - भृत्येन भृत्यं वा कटं कारयति., CAUSAL PASSIVE - भृत्यः कटं कार्यते ।\n- PRIMITIVE - The Servant prepares a mat., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He) causes the servant to prepare a mat., CAUSAL PASSIVE - The servant is made to prepare &c.\n- PRIMITIVE - गोविंदो मासमास्ते., CAUSAL ACTIVE - गोविंदं मासमासयति, CAUSAL PASSIVE - गोविंदो मासमास्यते ।\n- PRIMITIVE - _Govind_ sits for one month., CAUSAL ACTIVE - (He makes _Govind_ sit &c., CAUSAL PASSIVE - _Govind_ is made to sit &c.\n\n(a). But in the case of roots that imply 'knowledge' 'eating,' and those that have a literary work for their object, the principal object is put in the Nominative case, and the secondary in the Accusative, or vice versa e.g. माणवकं धर्मं बोधयति 'he makes _Manavaka_ know his duty'; माणवको धर्मं बोध्यते or माणवकं धर्मो बोध्यते '_Manavaka_ is made known his duty' or 'duty is made known to _Manavaka_'; वटुमोदनं भोजयति 'he makes the boy eat food:' वटुरोदनं भोजयते or वटुमोदनां भोज्यते (_Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_).\n\nWith regards to roots that govern two accusatives, the rules mentioned above bold good in their case also; i.e., those roots that imply motion &c., govern the Accusative of the subject of the primitive Case, and others, the Instrumental case, sometimes; as, वामनो बलिं वसुधां याचते : (ईश्वरो) वामनेन बलिं वसुधां याचयति (God) makes _Vamana_ ask _Bali_ for Earth.' गोपोऽजां नगरं हरति; (स्वामी) गोपं गोपेन वाजां नगरं हारयति. '(The master) makes the cowherd take the sheep to the town.'",
    "14053": "_ni_ (CAUSAL).\n\n- PRIMITIVE - As हरति भारं माणवकः, CAUSAL - हारयति भारं माणवकेन\n- PRIMITIVE - The boy takes the load., CAUSAL - He causes the servant to take the load.\n- PRIMITIVE - करोतिकटं देवदत्तः, CAUSAL - कारयति कटं देवदतं or देवदत्तेन.\n- PRIMITIVE - _Devadatta_ makes the mat., CAUSAL - He causes _Devadatta_ to make the mat.\n\nVart:- The subject of the primitive verbs अभिवद् and दृश् when used in the _Atmanepada_, is either put in the Accusative or instrumental case in the causal; as,\n\n- PRIMITIVE - अभिवदति गुरुं देवदत्तः, CAUSAL - अभिवादयते गुरुं or देवदत्तेन\n- PRIMITIVE - _Devadatta_ bows down to the _Guru_., CAUSAL - He makes _Devadatta_ bow down to the _Guru_.\n- PRIMITIVE - पश्यन्ति भृत्या राजानम्., CAUSAL - दर्शयते भृत्यान् राजानं or दर्शयते भृत्यैः.\n- PRIMITIVE - The servants see the king., CAUSAL - He makes the servants see the king",

When _hetu_ is employed as agent the verb is put in the causative form (III. 1. 26).\n\nThe force of the word च is to give both names to the mover of an agent, viz., _Hetu_ and _karta_: otherwise by _sutra_ 1 of this Chapter only one name would have been given.",
    "14056": "The word प्राक् of this _sutra_ serves the same purpose as the word _cha_ of the last; namely, it makes the words _Gati_, _upasarga_ and _karmapravachniya_ take two names, i.e., their one name as well as the name _Nipata_. The letter र in  प्राग्रीश्वरात् is to remove doubt, i.e., aphorism (I. 4.97) should be taken as limit and not _sutra_ (III. 4. 13) which has the word _iswari_ also.",

The vowels _a_, _a_, _i_, _i_, _u_, _e_, _ai_, _o_, _au_, when, as interjections, they indicate various emotions, differ from the ordinary vowels.\n\nउञ्, उकञ्, वेलायाम्, मात्रायाम्, यथा, यत्, तत्, किम्, पुरा, वधा, (वध्वा), धिक्, हाहा, हेहै, (हहे), पाट्, प्याट्, आहो, उताहो, हो, अहो, नो, (नौ), अथो, मनु, मन्ये, मिथ्या, असि, ब्रूहि, तु, नु, इति, इव, वत्, वात्, चन, यत, [सम्, वश्म्, शिकम्, दिकम्,] समुकम्, छन्वट्, (छंवठ), शंके, शुकम्, खम्, सनात्, सनुतर्, नहिकम्, सत्यम्, ऋतम्, अद्धा, इद्धा, नोचेत्, नचेत्, नहि, जातु, कथम्, कुतः, कुत्र, अव, अनु, हा, हे, (है), आहोस्वित्, शम्, कम्, खम्, दिष्ट्या, पशु, वट्, सह, अम्, ईम्, सीम्, सिम्, सिः, वै.\n\nTo the list of indeclinables belong also what have, without the reality, the appearance of an _upasarga_ (No.59), of a word with one of the terminations of case or persons and of the vowels. In the example अवदत्तम् _avadattam_ 'given away,' the अव is not really an _upasarga_, for if it were, the word (by VII. 4. 47) would be अवत्तम् _avattam_. In the example _ahanyuh_ अहंयुः 'egotistic,' the _ahan_ is not identical  the _aham_ 'I,' terminating in a case affix--because a pronoun, really regarded as being in the nominative case, could not be the first member, in such a compound. In the example अस्तिक्षीरा _astikshira_, a cow or the like 'in which there is milk,' the _asti_ अस्ति must be regarded as differing from the word _asti_, 'is,' which ends with the affix of the third person singular, otherwise it could not have appeared as the first member in a compound.",
    "14058": "The following is the list of प्रादयः or 'prepositions:' प्र, परा, अव, सम्, अनु, अव, निस्, दुस्, वि, आङ्, नि, अधि, अपि, अति, सु, उत्, अभि, प्रति, परि, उप ॥\n\nThe making of this a distinct aphorism, when it could well have been included in the last, is for the sake of giving the _Pra_ &c., words two names, namely, those of _Nipatas_, as well as _upasargas_ under certain circumstances, i.e., when they are in composition with verbs. Not so however the _cha_ &c., words. They never get the designation of _upasargas_.\n\nWhen these words signifying substances they are not _Nipatas_. As परा जयति सेना the excellent army conquers. Here the word परा is not a _Nipata_.",
    "14059": "As प्र + नयति = प्रणयति. Here the dental न is changed into cerebral ण, because of the प्र getting the designation of _upasarga_ (See _sutra_ (VIII. 4. 14)). Similarly परिणयति, प्रणायकः, परिणायकः.\n\nWhy do we say when in composition with a verb? When in composition with a noun they are not called _upasargas_. As प्रगतो नायकोऽस्माद् देशात् = प्रनायकोदेशः a country destitute of a leader. Here न is not changed into ण. Thus while प्रणायकः means 'a leader' the term प्रनायकः means destitute of a leader; though both have the same radical elements :-- _pra_ in one is an _upasarga_, in the other a _Nipata_ pure and simple.\n\nVart:- The word मरुत् should be included in the list of _upasargas_. As मरुद्भिर्दत्तः = मरुत्तः given by _Marut_. मरुत् + दा + क्त = मरुत् + त् + त (VII. 4. 47). Here _Marut_ being treated as an _upasarga_, though it does not end with a vowel, the दा is replaced by त by rule (VII. 4. 47) which declares 'त the substitute of दा which is called _ghu_ when it is preceded by an _upasarga_ that ends in a vowel, and is followed by an affix beginning with त which has an indicatory _k_.'\n\nIt might be objected, that as मरुत् does not end with a vowel, _sutra_ (VII. 4. 47) does not apply. To this we say that otherwise the giving the designation of _upasarga_ to मरुत् is superfluous; and in order that this should not be so, the fact of its not ending with a vowel is overlooked.\n\nVart:- The particle श्रत् should be included in the list of _upasargas_. Thus श्रत् + धा + अङ् = श्रद्धा (III. 3. 106). Here because श्रत् is treated as an _upasarga_, that _sutra_ (III. 3. 106) is made applicable.",
    "14060": "As प्रकृत्य, Now the gerund of the simple root कृ would have been कृत्वा, but as it is compounded with a _gati_ word (II. 2. 18) the त्वा is replaced by ल्यप् see (II. 2. 18) and (VII. 1 37). प्र + कृ + ल्यप् = प्रकृत्या (VI. 1. 71). Here _pra_ being called _gati_ we have compounding by rule (II. 2. 18); and then we apply (VII. 1. 37). Similarly प्रकृतम्. Here _pra_ being a _gati_ word retains its own accent by rule (VI. 2. 49). 'a _gati_ retains in a compound its own accent when it immediately precedes a second member that ends in _kta_, provided the latter denotes the object of the action which is expressed by the root to which _kta_ is added.'\n\nSimilarly प्रकरोति, here _pra_ being treated as _gati_ gets _anudatta_ accent by rule (VIII. 2. 71),\n\nThe _yoga_-_vibhaga_ or the separation of one aphorism into two, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms. The _anuvritti_ of _gati_ only runs through the latter _sutras_ and not of _upasarga_. So that while _pra_ &c., have two names _upasarga_ and _gati_; _uri_ &c., have only one name, namely, _gati_.\n\nThus in प्रणीतम् and अभिषि॑क्तम्, by treating the words अ and अभि as _upasargas_ we change the न and स into ण and ष by rule (VIII. 4. 14) and (VIII. 3. 87); and again treating them as _gati_ we regulate the accent.\n\nVart:- The words कारिका should be included in the list of _Gati_. As (1) कारिकाकृत्य (2) कारिकाकृतम् (3) यत्कारिका करोति. In the first by taking it as _gati_ we have _samasa_ (II. 2. 18) and ल्यप् (VII. 1. 37) The other two cases illustrate accent.\n\nVart:- The words पुनर् and चनस् are treated as _Gati_ in the _Vedas_. As पुनरुत्स्यूतंवासो देयम्. Here the word पुनर् being _gati_, causes स्यूतं to take _anudatta_ accent (VIII. 1. 70) चनोहितः. Here also the accent is regulated by (VIII. 2. 71).",
    "14061": "The affixes _chvi_ and _dach_ are ordained when the verb in composition is either कृ, भू or अस् (V. 4. 50) and (V. 4. 57) _uri_ &c., being read along with _chvi_ and _dach_, shows that the verb in composition with them must also be any one of the above three verbs, and none else; in order to entitle ऊरी to the name of _gati_.\n\nThe words ऊरी and उररी mean to assent and spread. As ऊरीकृत्य (II. 2. 18) and (VII. 1. 37) ऊरीकृतम् (VI. 2. 49), यदूरीकरोति (VIII. 2. 71). So with the word उररी.

    "14064": "The word अलम् is an indeclinable and has four meanings :- 'prohibition, competent, enough and ornament.' The term अलम् is _gati_ when it means ornament.\nAs अलंकृत्य (II. 2.18), (VII. 1. 37); अलंकृतं (VI. 2. 49) यदलंकरोति (VIII. 2. 71) when it does not mean ornament we have अलं भुक्त्वा व्रजति he goes having eaten enough.",

Observe अन्तर्हत्वा मूषिकां श्येनोगतः the hawk went away taking hold of the mouse.\n\nVart:- The word अन्तर् is treated as an _upasarga_ for the purpose of the application of the following rules; (III. 3. 106) by which अङ् is added; rule (III. 3. 92) by which कि is added; the rule (VIII. 4. 14) by which न is changed in to ण.

As पुरस्कृत्य, पुरस्कृतम् and यत् पुरस्करोति, when not an indeclinable we have पूः, पुरौ, पुरः कृत्वा काण्डंगतः.",

    "14083": "These particles govern a substantive and qualify a verb and differ from other particles termed _upasarga_ and _gati_. As सुस्तुतं भवता well praised by you. सु सिक्तं भवता you have sprinkled. Here सु is a _karma_ _pravachaniya_ and qualifies the sense of the verb, i. e. it is an adverb. It is not an _upasarga_, for had it been so, it would have changed the स into ष (VIII. 3. 65). The term _karma_ _pravachaniya_ is a big term compared with other technical terms such as, टि, घि, घु &c., which generally do not exceed more than two syllables. The word _karmapravachaniya_ is not however merely a technical term; it contains within itself a definition of itself. It means that which qualities or speaks about (प्रोक्तवन्त) an action (कर्म) is so called.",
    "14084": "The word _lakshana_ means a sign; an attendant circumstance an invariable concomitant or accident in its logical sense and not merely an occasional concurrence. The force of अनु in this case is that of 'after,' 'in consequence of,' 'because of, or being indicated by.' As जपमनु प्रावर्षम् it rained after or in consequence of the muttering of prayers. To put it in other words, _anu_ is a _karmapravachniya_ when it governs the word which indicates the cause or the attendant circumstance of an action.\n\nSo also शाकलस्य संहितामनु प्रावर्षत् = शाकल्येन सुकृतां संहितामनुनिशम्य देवः प्रावर्षत्. The God (clouds) rained having listened to the well performed reading, by _Sakalya_. The force of a _karmapravachaniya_, therefore, when fully analysed will be found to be that of an _upasarga_ whose verb is not expressed in the sentence but is understood; and because of its being so understood, the particle itself seems to govern the noun which in fact was governed by the unexpressed verb. Thus in the above example संहितां is in the accusative case, apparently governed by the preposition अनु, but really governed by the verb अनुनिशम्य understood.\n\nSo also अनडुद् यज्ञमन्वसिंचत्. The Taurus sprinkled water after the sacrifice, अगस्त्यमन्वसिंचत् प्रजाः the people began sprinkling water after the rising of the canopus.\n\nWhy make unnecessarily this _sutra_, when अनु would have been called _karma_ _pravachaniya_ even by force of sutra (I. 4. 90) following, where also the word _lakshana_ occurs? This is for the sake of indicating that the _karma_ _pravachaniyas_ should always govern the accusative case (II. 3. 8) even in expressing हेतु (II. 3. 23). Otherwise Rule 23rd of the third chapter of Book II would have set aside Rule 8 of the same by the maxim of परत्व (1. 3. 2): and would have caused a _karana_ _pravachaniya_ to govern an Instrumental case where the sense was that of _hetu_.",
    "14085": "The meaning of अनु in this case will be that of 'with' or along with. As नदीमनु अवसिता सेना the army lying along side the river. पर्वतमनु अवसिता सेना lying along the slopes of the mountain.",
    "14086": "The word हीन means 'inferior,' and being a comparative term requires the other term with which comparison is made and which is superior; to complete the sense. In other words अनु governs the person to which others are inferior, in the accusative case. As अनुशाकटायनवैयाकरणाः 'all grammarians are inferior to _Sakatayana_.'",
    "14087": "That is when the sense is that of 'over, above,' or 'inferior' as उपखार्यां द्रोणः a _Drona_ is above a _khari_. उप निष्के कार्षापणः a _karshapana_ is more than a _Nishka_. In this sense उप governs the Locative of the thing which is inferior (II. 3. 9). So also उप शाकटायनं वैयाकरणाः 'all grammarians are inferior to _Sakatayana_.' In this sense उप governs the accusative case.",
    "14088": "The force of अप and परि is in this case that of 'with the exception of.' As अपत्रिगर्त्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः it rained outside of or with the exception of _Trigarta_. So also परि त्रिगर्तेभ्यो वृष्टोदेवः. In this sense they govern the noun excluded in the ablative case (II. 3. 10). When not having these senses, they are not _karma_-_pravachaniya_. As ओदनं परिषिञ्चति. He waters the rice. Here it is an _upasarga_, and hence changes the स into ष.",
    "14089": "The word वचन in the text shows that both sorts of limits are here meant. As आपाटलिपुत्राद् वृष्टो देवः it rained as far as (but excluding) _Pataliputra_ आपाटलिपुत्रं वृष्टो देवः it rained as far as (including) _Pataliputra_ आकुमारं यशः पाणिनेः आसांकाश्यात्, आमथुरायाः when it means 'little' or is a verbal prefix it does not get this name.",
    "14090": "As (1) वृक्षं प्रति-परि or अनु विद्योतते विद्युत् 'the lightening is flashing in the direction of the tree.' (2) साधुर्देवदत्तो मातरं प्रति—परि = अनु '_Devadatta_ is a good man as regards his mother.' (3) हरं प्रति हलाहलं 'the poison fell to the share of _Hara_.' यदत्रमां प्रति स्यात् that it may fall to my share. So with परि and अनु. (4) वृक्षं वृक्षं प्रति सिञ्चति he sprinkles one tree after another. So with परि and अनु.",
    "14091": "The illustrations given under the last _sutra_ _mutus_ _mutandi_ apply here also, with the exception of those given under head (4). As वृक्षमभि विद्योतते; मातरमभि &c. But it is not _karma_-_pravachaniya_ when भाग is meant. भाग means the share which is allotted to one as his own. As यदत्रममाभिष्यात् तद् दीयताम् give that which falls here to my share. Here _abhi_ is an _upasarga_, and therefore स of स्य is changed into ष.",
    "14092": "That which is like to the principal is called प्रतिनिधि. Giving in return for what is obtained, is प्रतिदान. As अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति _ Abhi_-_manyu_ is the representative of _Arjuna_. माषानस्मै तिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति he exchanges _Mashas_ for these sesamum. In these senses _prati_ governs the Ablative (II. 3. 11.)",
    "14093": "As कुतोऽभ्यागच्छति whence has he come? Or कुतः पर्या गच्छति. These words though mere surplusages, have been called _karmapravachaniya_ so that they may not get the designation of _upasarga_ or _gati_ and thus produce results peculiar to those words.",
    "14094": "As सुसिक्तं भवता, सु स्तुतं भवता excellently sprinkled by your honor. Well praised by your honor. By not ष being an _upasarga_, it does not change the स into (VIII. 3. 65).\n\nWhy do we say 'when respect is meant'? Observe सुषिक्तं किं तवात्र has this your place been well sprinkled to-day.",
    "14095": "The word अतिक्रमण means to do more than what is necessary for the accomplishment of an object. The force of च in the aphorism is to draw in the word पूजायाम् from the last. As अतिसिक्तमेवा भवता. It has abundantly been sprinkled by your honor, अतिस्तुतमिव भवता so also अतिस्तुतं भवता excellently praised by your honor. अति सिक्तं भवता.",
    "14096": "The word पदार्थ means the sense of another word which is not expressed but has to be supplied. As सर्पिषोऽपि स्यात् there may be perhaps a drop of ghee मधुनोऽपि स्यात्. Here some word like _vindu_ 'a drop,' _stoka_ 'a little' _matra_, 'a measure' &c., has to be understood. The word संभावन means possibility, a supposition. As, अपि सिंचेत् मूलकसहस्रं क्षणेनैकेन possibly may sprinkle a thousand trees in one moment; अपि स्तुयाद् राजानं he may praise possibly, a king. In the above cases it is used with the potential mood. अन्वसर्ग means indifference on the part of the speaker where he permits another to do as he likes. It is used with the Imperative mood. As अपि सिंच you may sprinkle if you like. अपि स्तुहि you may praise if you like. The word गर्हा means censure, contempt or reproof. As धिक्जाल्मं देवदत्तमपि सिंचेत् पलाण्डुम्. The word समुच्चय means cumulative. As अपि स्तुहि—अपि सिंच praise as well as sprinkle.\nIn all the above instances, the word not being an _upasarga_, does not change the स into ष.",
    "14097": "The word ईश्वर means 'master,' and it therefore requires another correlative word denoting 'property' of which one is master. The word _adhi_ governs a Locative case. Sometimes locative of the person possessing, sometime locative of the property possessed: as अधि ब्रह्मदत्ते पंचालाः or अधि पंचालेषु ब्रह्मदत्तः. _Brahmadatta_ rules over _Panchalas_.",
    "14098": "As यदत्र मामधि करिष्यति. Here the word अधि may be treated either as a गति or a कर्मप्रवचनीय. When it is a गति the accent will be regulated by _Sutra_. (VIII. 1. 71); otherwise not.",
    "14099": "The word लः is in the genitive case, and means 'of ल.' The word आदेश 'substitutes' must be supplied to complete the sense. The term ल is a generic word for verb in general, viz., लट्, लिट्, लुट्, लृट्, लेट्, लोट्, लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ्, लृङ्. The substitutes of ल are the well known personal terminations by which the verbs are conjugated in those tenses. Namely the following.\n\n_PARASMAIPADA_.\n\n- 3rd person - तिप्, तस्, झि\n- 2nd person - सिप्, थस्, थ\n- 1st person - मिप्, वस्, मस्\n\nAnd the affixes शतृ and क्वसु (III. 2. 107), and (III. 2. 124), and (III. 4. 78).",
    "14100": "The following are the _Atmanepada_ affixes:--\n\n- 3rd person - त, आताम्, झ\n- 2nd person - थास्, आथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person - इट्, वहि, महिङ्\n\nAnd the affixes भाव and ज्ञान (III. 2.106),",
    "14101": "Of the 19 conjugational affixes, above given; 9 are _Parasmaipadi_ and 9 are _Atmanepadi_. Each of these two classes is subdivided into three classes, according to person, as shown in the above list.",
    "14102": "Of the six triads thus formed, each is divided according to number into three classes, viz., singular, dual, and plural.",
    "14103": "The _sup_ or the case-affixes by which nouns are declined are 21 in number corresponding to the seven cases, see _sutra_ (IV. 1. 2). They also have three numbers singular, dual and plural.",
    "14104": "The word विभक्ति means a complete triad. Thus सप्तमी विभक्ति means the three affixes of the seventh case, i.e., the locative singular, dual, and plural. So प्रथमा विभक्ति means the third person, singular, dual, and plural.",
    "14105": "This defines the 2nd person of conjugational affixes. As त्वं पचसि thou cookest or पचसि; युवां पचथः or पचथः you two are cooking; यूयं पचथ or पचथ you cook.",
    "14106": "The word प्रहास means joke, sport. As एवं मन्ये ओदनं भोक्ष्यसे इति; नहि भोक्ष्यसे, भुक्तः सोऽतिथिमिः. Thus thou thinkest 'I shall eat rice,' thou shalt not eat, that has been eaten by a guest. एहि मन्ये रथेन यास्यसि नहि यास्यसि, यातस्तेन ते पिता. I think thou wilt go by the chariot, no, thou wilt not, thy father has gone before thee on it. When joke is not intended, the proper persons should be used: as, एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये. Thus thou thinkest 'I shall eat rice.'",
    "14107": "This is clear. As अहं पचामि I cook, or merely पचामि-आवां पचावः or merely पचावः.",
    "14108": "As पचति he cooks, पचतः they two cook. पचन्ति they cook.",
    "14109": "When words are in _sanhita_, they are glued together by the rules of _sandhi_. As दद्ध्यत्र = दधि + अत्र.",
    "14110": "The word _avasana_ occurs in _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 15) &c.",
    "21001": "This is a _paribháshá_ or interpreting aphorism. Where ever in this Grammar a पदविधि is found, that must be understood to apply to समर्थ words. A rule relating to पद or complete words is called पदविधि. The word विधि is formed by adding वि to the root धाम्; that which is ordained (विधीयते) is called विधि. What are those rules which are ordained with regard to complete words? They are as follows.-(1) Rules relating to समास or compounding of words; (2) Rules relating to विभक्ति or the application of declensional and conjugational affixes; (3) and the rule by which one word is considered as if it had become a constituent member of another word (पराङ्गवद् भाव).\n\nThe word समर्थ means capable; that is to say, that which is capable of expressing the sense of a sentence on analysis, is called समर्थ ; or the word\/ समर्थ may mean that which depends upon words as connected in sense; that is to say, a rule relating to words whose senses are connected together.\n\nThus it will be taught in sútra 24 ‘a word ending with the second case-affix is optionally compounded with the words श्रित, अतीत &c. and forms _tatpurusha_ compound;' as, कष्टं श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः 'who has had recourse to pain'. But when these words are not समर्थ or connected in sense there can be no compounding; as, पश्य देवदत्त कष्टं, श्रितो विष्णुमित्रो गुरुकुलम् see O _Devadatta_, the pain, _Vishnumitra_ has taken recourse to his teacher's house. Here the words कष्टं and श्रितं though read in juxtaposition are not compounded, as they are not समर्थ.\n\nSimilarly, it will be taught in _sútra_ 30 'a word coding with the 3rd case-affix is optionally compounded with what denotes that the quality of which is instrumentally caused by the thing signified by what ends with the 3rd case-affix and with the word अर्थ wealth; as, शङ्कुलया + खण्डः = शङ्कुलाखण्डः 'a piece cut by nippers.' Here also when the words are not connected in sense there is no composition; as, करिष्यसि शङ्कुलया, खण्डो देवदत्त उपलेन 'thou shall do it with the nippers, _Devadatta_ is cut by the stones.'\n\nSimilarly, _sútra_ 36 declares, ' a word ending with the 4th case-affix, is compounded optionally with what denotes that which is for the purpose of what ends with the 4th case-affix, and so too with the words, अर्थ, बलि &c.\n\nThus यूपाय + दारु = यूपदारु' wood for a stake.' But when these words are not connected in sense, there is no composition; as, गच्छ त्वं यूपाय,दारु देवदत्तस्य गेहे  ‘ go thou for the stake, the wood is in _Devadatta's_ house.'\n\nSimilarly, _sútra_ 37 declares 'a word ending with the 5th case-affix may be compounded with the word भय; as, वृकेभ्यो भयं = वृकभयं ‘ fear by reason of a wolf. But when these words are not connected in sense, there is no composition; as, गच्छ त्वं मां वृकेभ्यो, भयं देवदत्तस्य यज्ञदत्तात् 'come thou to me from the wolves, there is fear to _Devadatta_ from _Yajñadatta_'.\n\nSimilarly, _sútra_ (II. 2. 8) declares \"a word ending with the 6th case affix is optionally compounded with what ends with a case-affix;\" as, राज्ञः पुरुषो = राजपुरुषः 'the king's man'. But when the words are not समर्थ , there is no composition: as भार्य्या राज्ञः, पुरुषो देवदत्तस्य \"the wife of the king, the man of _Devadatta_\".\n\nSimilarly, _sútra_ 40 declares. \"A word ending with the 7th case-affix is optionally compounded with the word शौण्ड  ‘skilled;' as, अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्षशौण्डः 'skilled in dice.' But when the words are not connected in sense, there is no composition; as, शक्तस्त्वमक्षेषु शौण्डः पिबति पानागारे ' thou art skilled in dice, the gambler drinks in the tavern.'\n\nWhy have we used the word पद  'a complete word' in the _sútra_? So that this समर्थ परिभाषा may not apply to वर्णविधि i.e. rules relating to letters.\n\nThus rules of सन्धि 'conjunction of letters' are वर्णविधि and not पदविधि; and therefore the condition of being connected in sense, does not apply here. Two words however disconnected in sense, must be glued together by the rules of _sandhi_, if those rules are applicable. Thus _sútra_  (VI. 1. 77) declares: 'instead of a letter denoted by the _pratyahara_ इक् there is one denoted by the _pratyahara_  यण् , in each instance, where one denoted by the _pratyahara_ अच् immediately follows;' . as,  दधि + अशान = दध्यशान. This substitution of य for इ will take place, whether the words are in construction or not, as  तिष्ठतु दध्यशान त्वं शाकेन  'let the curd remain, eat thou with the vegetable curry'. So also तिष्ठतु  कुमारीच्छत्रं हर देवदत्तात् 'let the girl be, take the umbrella from _Devadatta_'. Here the augment तुक् (त subsequently changed into च) comes between कुमारी and छत्र, though the two words are not connected in sense (VI. 1. 76).",
    "21002": "In other words, the word ending in a case-affix enters, as if, into the body of the vocative _(ámantrita)_ word; as it will be taught in _sútra_ (VI.1.198) which declares 'a word ending in a vocative case-affix, gets the _udátta_ accent on the beginning i.e. first syllable'. Now, this rule will apply even when a word ending with a case-affix precedes such word in the vocative case. Thus the word पती 'O two lords !' has _udatta_ on the first syllable. Now, when this word is preceded by another inflected noun as शुभस् of prosperity, the accent will fall on शु, the two words being considered as a single word; as:-\nअश्विना यज्वरीरिषो द्रवत्पाणी शुभस्पती | पुरुभुजाचनस्यतम || Rig. I. 3. 1.\n\"O _Asvins_, riding on quick horses, lords of prosperity, and bestowers of plenty of food, eat the sacrificial offerings to your satisfaction\". So also in the following: कुण्डे नाटन् 'O thou wandering with a bowl'. परशुना वृश्चन् 'O thou cutting with an axe.' मद्राणां राजन् 'O thou king of Madras.' कश्मीराणां राजन् 'O thou king of _Kashmir_.'\n\nWhy do we say 'a word ending with a case-affix?' If the preceding word ends with any other affix than a case-affix, this rule will not apply. As a पीड्ये पीड्यमान 'O thou who art pained, I am pained because of this thy pain.'\n\nHere पीड्ये 'being a तिङन्त (a verb)' is not considered as an anga of the vocative word.\n\nWhy do we say \"when followed by a word in the vocative case ?\" This rule will not apply when the subsequent word is not a vocative. As गेहे गार्ग्यः ' _Gárga_ is at home.'\n\nWhy do we say 'of the subsequent?' It will not be a part of the vocative word which precedes. As देवदत्त कुण्डे नाटन्  'O _Devadatta_ wandering with a bowl' Here कुण्डेन has not become part of _Devadatta_, but of the subsequent word अटन् .\n\nWhy do we say 'an _anga_ or component part?' Both must be considered as one word for the application of the rule of accent, so that the first syllable of each word separately may not get the _udátta_.\n\nWhy do we say 'as if or  वत्.' It is not altogether the body of the subsequent word; rules depending upon its own separate independent existence also take effect.\n\nThus rule (VIII. 1. 55) declares 'a word ending in the vocative case is not _anudátta_ when it follows the word आम् there intervening a word between itself and आम्;' as, आम् कुण्डेन नाटन् ! Here _kundena_ is considered a separate word for the purposes of Rule (VIII. 1. 55) and is said to intervene between आम् and the vocative word अटन् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'for the purposes of the application of rule of accent?' For the purposes of the application of any other rule, it will not be the _anga_ of the subsequent word; as, कूपे सिञ्चन् 'O thou sprinkling in the well.' चर्म नमन्. Here had कूपे and चर्म been the _angas_ of the subsequent words for all purposes, their स and न would have been changed into च and ण respectively by Rules (VII. 4.2) &c.\n\nVart:-When a word ending in a case-affix becomes, as if, the component part of the subsequent word, it becomes so even when there are several words in apposition with it which intervene between it and the vocative word ; because that, of itself, does not constitute want of immediate ness. Thus तीक्ष्णया सूच्या सीव्यन् 'O thou sewing with a sharp needle' तीक्ष्णेन परशुना वृश्चन् .\n\nVart:-Prohibition must be stated of indeclinable words. As उच्चैरधीयान  'O thou reading loudly. नीचैरधीयान.",
    "21003": "Thus it will be stated. 'The indeclinable word यया when not meaning like unto.' Here the word समास must be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense. • In fact this chapter and the second chapter treat of compounds and therefore the word compound must be read in all those aphorisms. \n\nThe word _prák_ is employed for the same purpose as it was used in (I. 4. 56) that is to give the designation of समास to various technical terms like अव्ययीभाव &c. which otherwise would not have got the name of समास.",
    "21004": "In this aphorism the word ay is understood from _sutra_, so that it consists of three words vis, सुप्, सह, सुपा. All these three words jointly and severally, one at a time or two at a time, should be understood as governing the succeeding aphorisms, as the contingency of each _sutra_ may require. This aphorism will constantly be applied in translating the _sutras_ that follow.\n\nWhy have we used the word सह? Well, without it the _sútra_ would have stood thus: सह सुपा'a noun may be compounded with another noun.' But this overlooks the case of a compounding with a verb. The word is therefore used so that we may be able to break this composite _sútra_ into two separate and simple _sútras_, namely:-\n\n(1). सह, सुप्, समस्यते समर्थेन' a case-ipflected word may be com. pounded with a word with which it is connected in sense'. Here the word or with the help of the three words सुप् taken from _sútra_ 2, समस्यते from _sútra_ 3, and समर्थेन from _sútra_ i, forms one complete aphorism, and applies to compounds like अनुव्यचलत् अनुप्रावर्षत . The accent will depend upon these being considered as _samasa_.\n\n(2). सुपा सह समस्यते a case-inflected word is compounded with another sup-inflected word. The compound which does not fall within any of the various sorts of compounds to be treated of hereafter, will fall under this general head of compounds; as, पुनरुत्स्यूतं वासो  देवं पूनर्निष्ठतो स्थः.. This also is for the sake of accents.",
    "21005": "This is also an  _adhikara_ aphorism like the last. As far as _sūtra_ 21, the compounds treated of, will get the designation of _Avyayibhava_. The word अव्ययीभाव like the word कर्मप्रवचनीय is a self-descriptive term, and not an arbitrary term like डि,धि  &c. When that which was not an indeclinable becomes an indeclinable, it is called stain or 'becoming an indeclinable'. In the _Avyayibhava_ compound the sense of the first of its elements is the main one or the independent one on which the other depends.",
    "21006": "The words and so are understood in this _sútra_. The word 47 should be read as connected with every one of the above phrases.\n\n1.विभक्तिवचन;- As अधिस्त्रि कथा वर्तते' a story relatiog to\nwomen.' अधिकारि relating to a girl.'\n\n2. समीपवचन; - As उपकुम्भम् ‘near to the jar.'उपमणिकं’  near to the gem.'\n\n3. समृद्धिवचन;- As सुमद्रं 'well or prosperous with the Madras'; सुमगधं 'well with the _Magadh_.'\n\n4. व्यृद्धिवचन;- As दुर्गवादिकं \"ill with the _Gavadikas_ ;\" दुर्यवन ' ill with the _Yavanas_.'\n\n5. अभाववचन;- As निर्मक्षिकम्  'free from flies;' निर्मशकं 'free from mosquitoes'.\n\n6. अत्ययवचन ;- As निर्हिमम् ‘on the departure of the cold weather';  निःशीतमं .\n\n7. असम्प्रतिवचन;- As अतितैसृकम् 'past (not now) the time of wearing quilts'.\n\n8. शब्दप्रादुर्भाववचन;-  As इति हरि 'the exclamation _Hari_' (thus वैष्णवगृहे इति हरि वर्तते 'in the house of the _Vaishnava_ there is the cry of _Hari_ _Hari_').\n\n9. पश्चाद्वचन;- As अनुरथं पादातम् 'the infantry after the chariots.'\n\n10. यथार्थवचन;- The meaning of the word यथा is four-fold, viz. correspondence, severalty  or succession, the not passing beyond something, and likeness; thus (1) अनुरूपम् 'in a corresponding manner.' (2) प्रत्यर्थम् 'according to each or several object or signification'. (3) यथाशक्ति ' according to one's ability'.\n\n11. आनुपूर्व्यवचन;- As अनुज्येष्ठं प्रविशन्तु भवन्तः 'let your honors enter in the order of seniority.'\n\n12. यौगपद्यवचन;- As सचक्रं धेहि  ‘simultaneously with the wheel.'\n\n13. सादृश्यवचन;  As ससखि  'like a friend.'\n\n14. सम्पत्तिवचन;- As सक्षत्रम्  'as warriors ought.' \t\n\n15. साकल्यवचन; As सतृणम्  'even to the grass' it, the whole, not leaving even a scrap. \n\n16. अन्तवचन;- As  साग्नि as far as the chapter of fire (i.e. the whole _Veda_).",
    "21007": "Thus यथावृद्धम् ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व  invite every old _Brahmana_. So also यथाध्यापकम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not signifying likeness?'. For there is no composition when likeness is indicated. As यथादेवदत्तस्तथा यज्ञदत्तः  As is _Devadatta_  so is _Yajñadatta_.\n\nThis _samása_ could have been included in the last _sútra_ clause to, but making a separate _sútra_  shows that the word यथार्थवचन there must be limited by the present _sútra_, to first three meanings of the word यथा given there and not to its fourth meaning. vis. there is no compounding when it means likeness.",
    "21008": "The word अवधारण means accurate ascertainment, restriction or limitation. As, यावदमत्रं ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयस्व invite so many _Bráhmanas_ only and not more as there are pots': i.e., if there are five pots then invite five _Bráhmans_; if six pots, then invite six _Bráhmans_. \n\nWhy do we say ‘when meaning limitation'? Observe यावद्दत्तं तावत् भुक्तम् ‘I ate so long as it was given to me,' i.e. I do not know for certainty how much I have eaten.",
    "21009": "The word नाना means a drop,' 'a little,'  'wee bit;' as, शाकप्रति \"a little of vegetable,' सूपप्रति 'a little of soup.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a little'? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतते विद्युत् 'it lightens in the direction of the tree.' Here it is not compounded.\n\nThough the word _sup_ was, by _anuvritti_  from _sútra_ 2, understood in this _sútra_, its repetition in the text is for the purpose of indicating that the _anuvritti_ of the word अव्यय which began with _sútra_  6 does not extend further into the subsequent _sútra_.\n\nThe word प्रतिना being exhibited in the 3rd case-affix is not an _upasarjana_ (l.2.43) and therefore, it comes as the last member of the compound (II.2.30).",
    "21010": "This समास is restricted to terms applicable to gambling. Thus there is a game called _panchiká_ which is played with fire dice or five ivory pieces When all these five pieces fall with faces turned upward, or all with faces turned down, then the thrower wins the game. But when the fall is otherwise, he loses. Thus अक्षपरि 'an unlucky throw of dice. शलाकापरि, an unlucky throw of ivory pieces '; so also एकपरि 'an unlucky throw by one over' द्विपरि, त्रिपरि  and lastly चतुष्परि.' This is the maximum.' But when Eve are of one form, then of course, he wins.",
    "21011": "This is an _adhikára_ _sútra_. All the rules of compounding given hereafter, are optional. The same sense can he expressed by the uncompounded words as by them when compounded. But not so are the compounds which have been treated of, before. Compounds like , सुमद्रं, यथाबद्धं, अक्षपरि &c. mentioned above arc invariable compounds (नित्य समास), the sense conveyed by the compound term, not being capable of analysis, by taking the senses of the separate members of the compounds, or at least not capable of expressing any sense without inserting extraneous words on analysis.",
    "21012": "As अपत्रिगर्तम् दृष्टो देवः  or अपत्रिगर्तेभ्यो दृष्टो देवः 'it rained away from _Trigarta_'. So also, परित्रिगर्तम् or परित्रिगर्तेभ्यः 'round about _Trigarta_,'बहिर्ग्रामम् or बहिर्ग्रामात् 'outside the village' प्राग् ग्रामम् or प्राग् ग्रामात् 'east of the village.'\n\nWords formed from the verb अञ्चु  'to go,' are उदञ्च 'north' प्राञ्च  east, &c.\n\nFrom this _sútra_ we learn by inference (_jñàpak_) that the word बहिः  also governs the ablative case (see II.3.29).",
    "21013": "As, आपाटलिपुत्रं or आपाटलिपुत्रात् दृष्टो देवः 'it rained up to _Pátaliputra_.' आकुकरं or आकुपरिभ्यो यशः पाणिनेः 'the fame of _Panini_  extends even to the boys.'",
    "21014": "The word _lakshana_ means a sign goal. See also (1. 4. 84) and go for a further explanation of this word. As अभ्यग्नि or अग्निमभिलभाः पतन्ति ‘the moths fall in the direction of fire.' So also प्रत्यभि or अग्निं प्रति, the sense being, that making the fire their aims (लक्ष्य) they fall towards it.  \n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning _lakshana_'? Observe स्रुग्घ्नं प्रति गतः 'he turned back and went towards _Srughna_ i.e., having torned back he went only towards the direction of _Srughna_ but not to that place itself.\n\nWhy do we say the words _abhi_ and _prati_? Observe येनाग्निस्तेन गतः 'he went in the direction of the fire' .\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning direction towards'? Observe अभ्यङ्का गावः or प्रत्यङ्कागावः 'the recently marked cows.'",
    "21015": "As, अनुवनमशनिर्गतः 'the thunder bolt fell near the forest.'\n\nWhy do we say अनु ? Observe वनं समया 'near the forest.'\n\nWhy do we say ‘when compounded with the word, nearness to which is indicated’? Observe वृक्षमनु विद्योतते विद्युत् ‘it lightens towards the tree.'\n\nThough this compounding was valid even by _sūtra_ 6, because nearness is mentioned there also; it is repeated here in order to show that an _Avyayibháva_ compound mentioned here is an optional compound after all, and not an invariable compound like others.",
    "21016": "As, अनुगङ्गं वाराणसी 'the city of _Benares_ extends alongside the river Ganges' अनुयमुनं मथुरा  _Mathura_, alongside of the _Yamuna_, the length of _Mathura_ being measured by that of the _Yamuna_.'\n\nWhy do we say 'length'? Observe वक्षमनु विद्योतते विद्युत्.",
    "21017": "The words तिष्ठद्गु, &c. are all irregularly formed _Avyayibhava_ compounds. Most of these words are epithets of various times. The force of च in the _sutra_ is restrictive, that is to say these words always form the _Avyayibhava_ compound and nothing else. They are as follows :-तिष्ठद्गु, वहद्गु, आयतीगवम् , खलेयवम्, खलेबुसम् , लूनयवम् , लूयमानयवम् , पूतयवम् , पूयमानयवम् , संहूतयवम् , संह्रियमाणयवम् , संहूतबुसम्, संह्रियमाणबुसम् , समभूमि , समपदाति , सुषमम् , विषमम् , दुष्षमम् , निष्षमम् , अपरसमम् , आयतीसमम् , प्राह्णम् , प्ररथम् , प्रमृगम् , प्रदक्षिणम् , अपरदक्षिणम् , सम्प्रति , असम्प्रति, पापसमम् , पुण्यसमम् , इच् कर्मव्यतिहारे- (V.4.127.) e.g., कचाकचि ।।",
    "21018": "Ordinarily these words would have formed Possessive _Tatpurusha_ compounds. The present _sûtra_ ordains _Avyayibhåva_ instead. The force of वा in the text is that the Genitive _Tatpurusha_ compounding also takes place in the alternative. As पारेगङ्गम् or गङ्गापारम् 'across the Ganges.' मध्येगङ्गम् or गङ्गमध्यम् 'middle of the Ganges.'\n\nOf course according to the option allowed by _sutra_ (II. 1. 11), this compounding need not take place at all, the same sense being expressed by a phrase; as पारं गङ्गायाः or मध्यं गङ्गायाः .",
    "21019": "The word वंश means uninterrupted descent of persons from a common source whether through birth or knowledge. A succession of teachers and pupils, of ancestors and descendants, &c., would constitute a वंश 'family.' One born in or belonging to such a वंश is called a वंश्य or descendant.\n\nAs, दिमुनि व्याकरणस्य 'of the _Vyakarana_,' which has two sages as its principal expounders viz., _Panini_ and _Patanjali_. So, त्रिमुनिव्याकरणस्य 'having three representatives viz., _Pånini_, _Patanjali_ and _Sakatayana_ or _Katyayana_.'\n\nWhen we desire to express their equality as regards knowledge, then both the words are put in the same case: as द्विमुनि or त्रिमुनि व्याकरणम् .\n\nSo also when the relationship is by birth: as, एकविंशति भारद्वाजम् Twenty-one _Bharadwajas_. These a subsequent compounds are like _Dvigu_.",
    "21020": "According to _Patanjali_ this refers to their Aggregate (समाहार); as सप्तगङ्गम् ' at the meeting of the seven _Ganges_,' द्वियमुनं 'at the meeting of the two _Yamunas_,' पञ्चनदं' where the five rivers meet'. सप्तगोदावरम् 'where seven _Godavaris_' meet.",
    "21021": "The _anuvritti_ of the word _samkhyå_ does not extend to this _sutra_. Though this rule is given in the sub-division relating to optional compounds it is, however, a _Nitya-samasa_ rule : for no Name (सञ्ज्ञा) can ever be expressed by a sentence, and that being so, these compounds can never be analysed. As उन्मत्तगङ्गम् ' the country called _Unmatta Ganges_ .' So also लोहितगङ्गम्, कृष्णगङ्गम् ; शनैर्गङ्गम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it denotes a thing other than that expressed by the component parts of the compound' ? Observe कृष्णवेण the 'river _Krishnavena_.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when it expresses an Appellative' ? Observe शीर्घो गङ्गो देशः ' the country where the _Ganges_ moves rapidly.'",
    "21022": "From this _sutra_ as far as the _sutra_ (II. 2. 23) relating to _Bahuvrihi_ compounds, the word _Tat-purusha_ should be read into each _sutra_. This  big term is of older coinage than that of _Panini_, being, in fact, made by older grammarians. In the _Tat-purusha_ compound, the sense of the last of its elements is the main one, and governs the preceding one. The _Karmadhåraya_ (Appositional Determinative Compound) and _Dwigu_ (Numeral Determinative Compound) are also sub-divisions of this class of compounds. The rest of this chapter and 22 _sůtras_ of the second, deal with this.",
    "21023": "The object of making _Dwigu_ a sub-division of _Tat-purusha_ Compound is that the समासान्त affixes and rules given in (V. 4. 68-160) should apply to _Dwigu_ also. Otherwise we could well have dispensed with this _sutra_; as _sútra_ 52 of this chapter already defines _Dwigu_. Thus पञ्चराज्ञ (V. 4. 91) fem. पञ्चराज्ञी (IV. I. 15., 21), 'an aggregate of 5 princes' द्ववहः, '(V. 4. 89), पञ्चगवम् 'an aggregate of 5 cows.' दशगवम् 'an aggregate of ten cows.' (V. 4. 92.)",
    "21024": "As कष्टं+ श्रितः = कष्टश्रितः 'who has had recourse to trouble.' , नरकश्रितः, So also :- कान्तारातीतः 'who has passed over the dreary forest.', नरकपतितः, 'fallen into hell.' आमगतः 'gone to village.' तरङ्गात्यस्तः 'passed the waves.' सुखप्राप्तः  'who has reached pleasure.' सुखापन्नः 'who has obtained happiness.'\nThe words गमी, गामी &c., should also be included. As ग्रामगमी, ग्रामगामी; ओदन बुभुक्षुः .",
    "21025": "The _anuvritti_ of the word द्वितीया from the last aphorism into this, cannot take place; though, however, it is understood in the next _sūtra_. The word स्वयम् being an Indeclinable, cannot take any case-affix. As स्वयै धौतौ पदौ 'feet washed by himself' स्वयं विलीनमज्यम्.\n\nIn this compounding, the two words do not appear to have undergone any change after their composition. They are the same as they were before the composition. But by calling their juxtaposition, 'a compound,' two indirect advantages are gained. Namely these two words are regarded as one word, and their accent is also similarly regulated. See Rule (VI. I. 223).\n\nThe words ending in _kta_ which is a _Nistha_. affix, are past participles.",
    "21026": "The word क्षेप means 'censure,' 'blame' and this sense can be connoted only by the compound word as a whole and not by any of its constituent elements. This compound is also, therefore, a _Nitya_ Compound, though it occurs in the sub-division relating to Optional Compounds :-because it is impossible to analyse such a compound and express, by means of sentence, the sense conveyed by the function of the compound word.\n\nAs खट्वारूढः or खट्वाप्लुतः (literally lying on a bed); silly, stupid, going wrong or astray.\n\nThere is no compounding when 'censure is not meant.' As खठ्वामारूढः 'lying on a bed.'\n\nWhy this word should have this opprobrious meaning, will be understood from the consideration of the following facts :-a person under the _Aryan_ social polity, could only then enter the married state or the life of a house-holder, as it was called, when he had completed his _Brahmacharya_ i.e., the prescribed period of bachelor studentship. All _Brahmacharis_ were bound to sleep on ground and not on खट्वा or cots, so long as they were _Brahmacharis_. A person who without completing his studies, and without obtaining the permission of his teacher, entered into matrimony, was originally called, in reproach, खट्वारूढः 'who had ascended the couch in an improper way.' Then the term was extended to all persons guilty of vile action.",
    "21027": "The word सामि being an _avyaya_, and not denoting any substance, cannot take the affixes of the second or any case. Therefore the _anuvritti_ of the word द्वितीया would be inapposite in this aphorism.\n\nAs सामिकृतम् 'half-done.' सामिपीतम् 'half-drunk' सामिभुक्तम् 'half-eaten.'\n\nThe object attained by this _samása_ is the same as in (II. 1. 25), namely, making them one word and taking one accent.",
    "21028": "This rule applies when duration of time is not connoted by the compound, which is provided for, in the next aphorism. The word for कालाः does not mean here, as it would otherwise mean by _Sutra_ I. 1. 68, the word- from काल but special words denoting काल.\n\nAs मासप्रभितश्चचन्द्रमाः 'the new moon,' (literally, the moon that has begun to measure the month). Similarly, अहस्सङ्क्रान्ताः, रात्रिसङ्क्रान्ताः applied to six _Muhurtas_ (of 48 minutes each) which are called चर and अचर which sometimes occur in day time (in the summer month) and sometimes in the night (in the winter).",
    "21029": "The word काल is understood in this aphorism; but not so the phrase 'ending with the affix क्त.'\n\nThe word अत्यन्तसंयोग means 'uninterrupted connection.' For accent of these words see (VI. 2. 2.)\n\nAs मुहूर्तसुखम् 'a momentary pleasure.' सर्वरात्रकल्याणी, सर्वरात्रशोभना.",
    "21030": "The words सुप्, सुपा are understood here: and the whole of this _sutra_ is an epithet of those words. A noun in the instrumental case is compounded with a word expressing quality, and with the word अर्थः provided that the word expressing quality is itself the result produced by the sense of the word in the instrumental case शङ्कुलयाखण्डः शङ्कुलाखण्डः 'cut by nipper' किरिकाणः 'made blind of one eye by a hog' धान्यार्थः 'wealth acquired by grain.' For accent of these words see (VI. 2. 2.)\n\nWhy do we say 'when caused by the word in the instrumental case'? Observe अक्ष्णा काणः 'blind of one eye.' Here अक्ष्णा in the 3rd case is not the instrumental cause that produced blindness and hence no compounding.\n\nWhy do we say 'a word expressing quality ?' Observe :- गोभिर्वपावान् 'sowing with the cows.' Here though 'sowing' is instrumentally caused by the Cows, yet it does not qualify cows but the sower, and hence no compounding. \n\n_Guna-vachanas_ are those words which, not being words formed by primary or secondary affixes, or other words entitled to the name of _samkhya_, or _sarvanama_, or _jati_, or compound words, are words denoting qualities and capable of being used as adjectives qualifying substantives.",
    "21031": "From this _sutra_, we learn incidentally that the words पूर्व, &c., govern the instrumental case.\n\nAs, मासेन पूर्वः = मासपूर्वः 'prior by a month,' संवत्सरपूर्वः 'prior by a year,' मातृसदृशः 'like the mother,' पितृसदृशः 'like the father,' मातृसमः 'similar to the mother,' पितृसमः 'similar to the father,' माषोनम्, माषविकलं 'less by a _masha_, असिकलहः'a fight with the swords,' वाक्कलहः 'bandying words.'वाग् निपुणः 'proficient in speech,' आचारनिपुणः 'proficient in the observances of sacred duties,' तिलमिश्रः — गुडमिश्रः 'mixed with sesamum or jaggery' आचारश्लक्षणः 'polished in behaviour.' \n\nVart :-The word अवर should be enumerated in the list, as मासावरः 'later than a month.'",
    "21032": "The word बहुलं shows that there is a general relaxation of all the rules and conditions. As अहिना हतः = अहिहतः 'killed by the snake' नखनिर्भिन्नः 'divided by the nails.' परशुच्छिन्नः' cut by the axe.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the agent or the instrument'? Observe भिक्षाभिरुषितः 'dwelt with alms.' Here the force of the 3rd case is that mentioned in _sutra_ (II. 3. 21) and not that of (II. 3. 18.)'\n\nWhy do we say 'diversely'? Observe दात्रेण लूनवान् 'cutting with the sickle.' परशुना छिन्नवान् 'cutting with the axe. Here there is no compounding. But there is compounding where otherwise there ought not to be, because of the word बहुलः-- as पादहारकः and गले चोपकः .",
    "21033": "As काकपेयानदी 'a shallow river' (so shallow that a crow may dip his beak into it and touch the bottom and drink). श्वलेह्य कूपः 'a shallow well' (so that a dog can lick water from the brink of it). वाष्पच्छेद्यानि तृणानि 'thin grass' (so fragile that it can be cut by vapour) कण्टकसञ्चेय ओदनः .\n\nThis _sūtra_ is in a way a prolongation of the last .\n\nVart:-The phrase 'words ending in a _kritya_ affix' must not be taken universally, only the _kritya_ affixes यत् and ण्यत् are meant in the above _sutras_. The following are the _kritya_ affixes :- तव्य, अनीय, यत्, क्यप्, ण्यत्, (see _sutra_ III. 1.95-132). Therefore there is no compounding when the word ends in तव्य as in काकैः पातव्या.",
    "21034": "That which is to be prepared is called अन्न, and that which prepares is व्यञ्जन; a, दध्योदनः = दध्ना उपसिक्त ओदनः 'rice prepared or made relishable with curd.' So also क्षीरौदनः. The words 'food' and 'condiment' as represented in the above compounds, are connected in sense by a verb understood.",
    "21035": "Anything eatable, whether hard or soft, is called भक्ष्य; its refinement is called मिश्रीकरणं. As गुडधानाः  'barley prepared with jaggery;' गुडपृथकाः  'flattened parched rice prepared with jaggery.' \n The connection here also between the two words is established by a verb understood.",
    "21036": "The words सुप, सुपा are understood in this _sutra_ and the whole _sutra_ qualifies these words. \n\nBy the expression तदर्थ 'for the purpose thereof,' the special relation of a material and its modification alone is by Patanjali here held to be intended. As यूपाय दारुः = यूपदारुः 'wood for stake' (that is wood which by modification will be changed into a stake). कुण्डलहिरण्यं 'gold for ear-ring.' But not so here. रन्धनाय स्याली 'pot for cooking.' अवहननायोलूखलम् 'the wood mortar for threshing. From this _sûtra_ we may also infer that the Dative case conveys also the sense of 'for the purpose thereof.' The word तदर्थार्थ is taken as one word by some, meaning 'a thing serviceable thereto.' See VI. 2. 44. For accent, see VI. 2. 45.\n\nVart:- With the word अर्थ the compound so formed is a _Nitya_ compound (an invariable compound) and agrees in gender with the word which it qualifies; as, ब्राह्मणार्थम् पयः 'milk for the sake of _Brahmans;' and ब्राह्मणार्था यवागूः 'gruel for the Brahmanas.' So also कुवेरबलिः 'a sacrifice for _Kuvera_' महाराजबलिः 'a sacrifice for the great Raja.' गोहितं ' what is good for cows.' अश्वहितं 'what is good for horses' गोसुखं 'what is pleasant for cows' गोरक्षितं 'what is kept for cows,' (as grass).",
    "21037": "The phrase सुप् सुपा is understood here, and the _sutra_ qualifies it.\n\n As वृकेभ्यो भयं=वृकभयं 'fear from wolves,'  चौरभयं 'fear from thieves,' दस्युभयं 'fear from robbers.'\n\nVart:- So also with the words भीत, भीति, and भीः as वृकभीतः, वृकभीतिः, वृकभीः.\nThis _sutra_ is an expansion of _sûtra_ 32 and an exposition of the word बहुल there. So that we may have the following compounds also: ग्रामनिर्गतः 'gone out of the village.' अधर्म जुगुप्सुः .",
    "21038": "As, सुखापेतः 'gone away from pleasure.' कलपनापोढः 'carried away by imagination' चक्रमुक्तः 'freed from the wheel.' स्वर्गपतितः 'fallen from heaven.' तरङ्गापत्रस्तः 'afraid of the waves.' This is an expansion of (II. 1. 32.)\n\nBy using the word अल्पशः 'in a gradual degree,' is shown the limited range of this kind of compounds. Not every ablative word can be so compounded. Hence there is no compounding at all in the following cases :- प्रासादात् पतितः, 'fallen from the mansion.' भोजनादपत्रस्तः 'afraid of eating.' For here the fall &c., is violent and sudden, and not gradual and slight.",
    "21039": "As स्तोकान्मुक्तः 'loosed from a little distance.'\n\nSo also अन्तिकादागतः 'come from near' अभ्याशादागतः 'come from near' दूरादागतः 'come from far, विप्रकृष्टादागतः 'come from a distance.' कृच्छ्रान्मुक्तः ‘saved with difficulty.' कृच्छ्रन् लब्धः 'obtained with difficulty.'\n\nBy rule (VI. 3. 2) the case-affix is not elided in compounds of this kind.\n\nVart:- The words शत 'a hundred' and सहस्र 'a thousand' are similarly compounded with the word पर. As, शतात्परे = परश्शताः 'beyond a hundred:' So also परसहस्राः 'beyond a thousand.' In these examples the word शत and सहस्र being exhibited in the 1st case and thus being _upasarjana_ ought to have stood as the first member of the compound (II. 2. 30); But these compounds are supposed to fall under the class of राजदन्त &c, (II. 2. 31) and hence the _upasarjana_ stands as the second member of the compound. Irregularly is also the augment स (सुद्) interposed between these two words.",
    "21040": "The word शौण्डैः in the _sútra_ being in the plural number indicates a class of words beginning with _šaunda_.\n\nAs, अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्षशौण्डः ‘skilled in dice' अक्षधूर्तः 'cunning in dice' अक्षकितवः 'a gamester in dice.'\n\nThe following is the list of शौण्डादि words:-1 शौण्ड, 2 धूर्त, 3 कितव, 4 व्याड, 5 प्रवीण, 6 संवीत, 7 अन्तर् when meaning place, 8 अधि, 9 पटु, (or अधिपटु), 10 पण्डित, 11 कुशल, 12 चपल, 13 निपुण, 14 संव्याड, 15 मन्य, and 16 समीर.",
    "21041": "As, साङ्काश्यसिद्धः 'perfect in Sánkásya.' काम्पिल्यसिद्धः 'perfect in Kampilya.' आतपशुष्कः 'dried in the sun.' छायाशुष्कः dried in the shade.' स्थालीपकः 'cooked in pot.' कुम्भी पक्वः 'cooked in an earthen jar.' चक्रबन्धः 'bound on the wheel.’ For their accent see (VI. 2. 32.)\n \nThese are also further illustrations of the word as in _sútra_ 32.",
    "21042": "As, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षः 'a crow at the sacred bathing place' i.e., a very greedy person; as a crow in a bathing place does not remain long, any where, so a person who goes to his teacher's house and does not tarry there long, is called a तीर्थकाकः or a तीर्थवायसः.\n\nWhen it has not this meaning, there is no compounding: as, तीर्थध्वाङ्क्षस्तिष्ठति ‘There is a crow in the sacred bathing place.'",
    "21043": "This compound is confined to the words formed by the _kritya_ affix यत् and not to every _kritya_-formed word.\n\nAs, मासदेयम् 'a debt repayable within a month.' So संवत्सरदेयं 'payable within a year.' त्र्यहदेयं ‘repayable within three days.’\n\nBy using the word ऋण we indicate by implication any appointed time in general, and not merely a time for the payment of a debt. Therefore we get compounds in the following cases also:- पूर्वाह्नो गेयं साम 'the _Sáma_ that should be sung in the morning.' प्रातरध्येयोऽनुवाकः 'the chapter that should be studied in the morning.'\n\nWhy do we say ‘debt’? Observe मासे देया भिक्षा 'the alms that should be gives each month.'",
    "21044": "A _sanjña_ is expressed by the complete word, hence it is an invariable (_nitya_) compound; for we cannot express an appellative by a sentence.\n\nAs, अरण्ये तिलकाः 'wild sesamum' yielding no oil; anything which does not answer to one's expectation. So also अरण्ये माषाः, वने किंशुकाः' anything found unexpectedly.' So also वने बिल्वकाः, कूपे पिशाचकाः.\n\nThe case-affix is not elided, in this case, in accordance to _sútra_ (VI. 3. 9.) (The 7th case-affix is not elided after words ending in consonants or in short अ when the compound denotes appellative.)",
    "21045": "As, पूर्वाह्णकृतम् ‘done in the morning.' अपराह्णकृतम् ‘done in the afternoon.' पूर्वरात्रकृतम् ‘done in the first part of the night.' अपररात्रकृतम् ‘done in the last part of the night.'\n\nWhy do we say 'members or divisions of day and night?' Observe अहनि भुक्तम्  'eaten in the day' रात्रौ वृत्तम् 'occurring in the night.'\n\nThis being a continuation of _sútra_ (II. 1. 32), we have diversely रात्रिवृत्तम् and सन्ध्यागर्जितं.",
    "21046": "Thus तत्रभुक्तम् ‘eaten there.' तत्रकृतं 'done there,’ तत्रपीतं 'drunk there.' By making this a compound, the same purpose is served as in _sútra_ (II. 1. 25) namely, these two words form one word and get one accent.",
    "21047": "As, अवतप्तेन कुलस्थितं त एतत् 'they are as if an ichneumon standing on hot ground (metaphorically said of the inconstancy of man) चापलम्।।\n\nSo also उदके विशीर्णम् ‘dried in water,' (figuratively used for any thing unheard of or impossible.)\n\nSo also प्रवाहे मुत्रितम् (lit.) 'making water in a stream,' (fig.) 'doing a useless action.' भस्मनि हुतम् 'offered oblation in ashes,' (fig.) 'a fruitless action.'\n\nThe 7th case-affix is not elided in the case of this _sútra_ also. See _sútra_ (VI. 3. 14.)",
    "21048": "The words like _pátre_-_sammita_ 'a dish-companion' (a parasite), &c., are _Tat-purusha_ compounds, when contempt is implied.\n\nAll these are irregular compounds. Some of the words contained in this list are compounds formed with the past-participle (क्त); they could have been formed by previous aphorism also. Their inclusion in this list is for the purpose that their first member should have _udatta_ on the beginning; because all the words belonging to this class, are a subdivision of a larger class called 'युक्तारोह्यादि Class' treated of in _sútra_ (VI. 2.81.)\n\nThe following is the list of the words:- 1 पात्रेसम्मिताः, 2 पात्रेबहुलाः, 'a parasite' (constant at meals or dinner time). 3 उदुम्बरमशकः, 4 उदुम्बरकृमिः, 5 उदरकृमिः, 6 कूपकच्छपः, 7 अवटकच्छपः, 8 कूपमण्डूकः, 9 कुम्भमण्डूकः, 10 उदपानमण्डूकः, 11 नगरकाकः, 12 नगरवायसः, 13 मातरिपुरुषः, 14 पिण्डीशूरः, 15 पितरिशूरः, 16 गेहेशूरः, 17 गेहेनर्दी, 18 गेहेक्ष्वेडी, 19 गेहेविजिती, 20 गेहव्याडः, 21 गेहेमेही, 22 गेहेदाही, 23 गेहेदृप्तः, 24 गेहेधृष्टः, 25 गर्भेतृप्तः, 26 आखनिकबकः, गोष्ठेशूरः, 28 गोष्ठेविजिती, 29 गोष्ठेक्ष्वेडी, 30 गोष्ठेपटुः, 31 गोष्ठेपण्डितः, 32 गोष्ठेप्रगल्भः, 33 कर्णेटिरिटिरा, 34 कर्णेचुरुचुरा।।",
    "21049": "The phrase सुप् सुपा is understood here, the whole _sútra_ qualifying it.\n\nWords which separately can be applied to many distinct and different objects, when they apply to one common object, are said to be in apposition (समानाधिकरणं) or abiding in a common substratum.\n\nln the present _sútra_ the word-form _púrva-kála_, is not to be taken (I. 1.68) but its significates; while of the rest एक &c., the very word-form is to be taken. A word denoting action which naturally precedes in time, is compounded with a word denoting action which naturally succeeds it. As, स्नातानुलिप्तः 'bathed and perfumed' कृष्टसमीकृतम् ' ploughed and levelled.' दग्धप्ररूढम् 'burnt and healed.’ एकशाटी 'having one petticoat.' एकभिक्षा 'begging once in a day.' सर्वदेवाः 'All gods.' सर्वमनुष्याः 'all men.' जरद्धस्ती 'old elephant.' जरद्गृष्टिः 'an old cow.' जरद्वृत्तिः 'old occupation.' पुराणान्नम् 'old rice.' पुराणावसथम् 'an old habitation.' So नवान्नम्; नवावसथम्; केवलान्नम् 'only rice.'\n\nWhy do we say when they are in the same case? Observe एकस्याः शाटी 'one's petticoat.'\nThese and the subsequent compounds are _Karmadháraya _ Compounds (I. 2. 42).",
    "21050": "The phrase 'being in apposition,' is understood in every one of these _sútras_ up to the end of the chapter.\n\n- As पूर्वेषुकामशमी 'the town of _Ishukamasami_ -in-the-east.' अपरेषुकामशमी the town of _Ishukamasami_ -in-the-west.' पञ्चाम्राः 'the five mangoes' सप्तर्षयः 'the seven-sages' (the constellation of the Great Bear),\n\nWhy do we say ‘when the sense is that of an appellative ?' Observe उत्तरा वृक्षाः 'northern trees.' पञ्च ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' See (IV. 2. 107.)",
    "21051": "First let us take the case where the sense is that of a _Taddhita_-affix. Thus when a compound is formed out of the words पूर्वस्यां शालायां भवः 'that which is in the eastern hall' (in which analytical exposition of the compound in question, the word भव (IV. 2. 107) serves to represent the force of a _Taddhita_ -affix) the compound having reached the form of पूर्वा+शाला, the feminine termination of the पूर्वा is rejected, because _Patanjali_ declares that the masculine state belongs to a pronominal when exercising any of the five functions belonging to a word; we have :-पूर्व + शाला + अ (IV. 2. 107) = पौर्वशालः (VII. 2. 117 and VI. 4.148) 'who is in the eastern hall.'\n\nSo also when an additional member comes after the compound (_uttarpade_) As, पूर्वशालप्रियः or अपरशालप्रियः 'loving the eastern or western hall.' Those _Uttarpada_ Compounds are invariable (_Nitya_) compounds, so that they can not be resolved into their component elements.\n\nWhen a समाहार  'aggregate' is to be expressed, it is of course impossible to use a word expressing points of the compass ( दिक् words ). The following compounds are formed with numbers (सङ्ख्या), when employed with the force of a _Taddhita_ affix; as, पाञ्चनापितिः 'relating to five barbers.' पाञ्चकपाल 'relating to an oblation offered in five cups' (कपाल) (IV. 1. 88). So also पञ्चगवधन (V. 4.92) 'Whose wealth consists of five cows,' दशगवधनः\n\nThe following are examples of aggregates:- पञ्चफली 'the collection of five fruits' (IV. 1. 21) दशपूली 'an aggregate of ten bundles,'त्रिलोकी 'the aggregate of the three worlds.' पञ्चकुमारि 'an aggregate of five virgins;' this word is neuter by (II. 417.)and the long ई is shortened by (I. 2. 47.)",
    "21052": "First to take an example of _Taddhitartha_:-as, पञ्चेषु कपालेषु संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः 'an offering prepared or offered in five cups.' So also दशकपालः 'prepared in tea cups.' These are names of _Purodása_ offerings; and are formed by adding the affix अण् in the sense of 'refining an object of food' by sūtra (IV. 2. 16); then this affix is elided (लुक्) by (IV. 1, 88).\n\nTo take an example when an additional member comes after the compound. As पञ्चनावप्रियः loving five ships. द्विनावरुप्यम् money which has come by two ships' (द्वि+नौ+टच् (V. 4. 99) = द्विनाव)\n\nOf an aggregate we have पञ्चपूली. The feminine is formed by (IV. 1. 21).",
    "21053": "As वैयाकरणसूचि 'a bad or dull grammarian.' Here it might be asked is the word व्याकरणं 'grammar' a word of contempt, or the word वैयाकरण 'grammarian'? Neither 'Grammar' (it being a part of _Vedanga_,) nor the person who studies it i.e., the grammarian, can be an object of contempt ordinarily.\n\nThe word 'grammarian' is, however, the expression of contempt in an indirect way, thus :- The person studying grammar but not studying it well, becomes an object of contempt and such a despicable person becomes also contaminated. The word खसूचि is a term of contempt per se. It literally means, a person who on being asked a question, and not possessing ready wit and intelligence to answer it, scratches his head and contemplates vacancy (खंसूचयति) and tries to divert the questioner's attention by exclaiming 'how beautifully clear is the sky,' such a person is called खसूचिः.\n\nSuch compounds are confined to cases where the reason for the use of any particular term is to express contempt with regard to the signification of that term. So we can not form a compound of the sentence वैयाकरणश्चौरः 'the thief grammarian;' for, contempt is not expressed with regard to the signification of the word 'grammarian.' But when the term 'grammarian' itself is used in a contemptuous signification, then a compound will be formed.\n\nThis aphorism is commenced in order to introduce an exception to _sútra_ 57, by which an adjective stands as the first member in a compound. By the present _sútra_, however, the attributive word will stand as the second member.\n\nOther examples of such compounds are: याज्ञिककितवः ‘one who hankers after performing sacrifices for persons for whom one ought not to perform sacrifices' मीमंसक-दुर्दुरूढः 'an unbelieving logician,' ‘an athiest.’\n\nNo compound can be formed under this aphorism, if both the words are not used in an opprobatory signification as such. Therefore it is not in the following case. कुत्सितोब्राह्मणः 'the bad Brahmana' &c.",
    "21054": "Both the words पाप and अणक are words of contempt (कुत्सन) ; by the last _sútra_, they would have stood as second members in the compound; the present _sútra_, however, is so framed with regard to _sútra_ (I. 2. 43) and (II. 2. 30), that they will stand as first. As पापनापितः or अणकनापितःः 'a contemptible barber' पाप or अणक-कुलालः 'a contemptible potter.’",
    "21055": "That by or to which a thing is compared is '_upamana_' and the ‘_upameya_' (the thing compared) is called सामान्य or 'common'. Thus घनश्याम कृष्णः 'cloud-black Krishna' (Krishna black as a cloud). Here श्याम is a quality common to Krishna and cloud: therefore 'cloud' which is the उपमान is compounded with it. So also कुमुदश्येनी 'lily-white.' हंसगदग्दा 'Swan-sounding' न्यग्रोध-पारिमण्डला 'globular as _Nyagrodha_ tree.' For accent see (VI. 2. 2).\n\nBut not so in देवदत्ता श्यामा 'black _Devadatta_' or फला इव तन्दुलाः 'the rice are like fruits' पर्वता इव बलाहकाः 'clouds like mountains'.",
    "21056": "This is a modification of _sůtra_ 57, by which the objective would have stood first; by the present, the attribute stands second. As पुरुषोऽयं  व्याघ्र इव = पुरुषव्याघ्रः 'a person-tiger' (in strength) पुरुषसिंहः\n\nIn the last _sutra_, the compounding was between the उपमान  and the common quality. In the present, the compounding is between the उपमित  and certain उपमान but never with सामान्य वचन. Therefore we can not form this kind of compound from the following sentence:- पुरुषो व्याघ्र इव शूरः 'a man strong as a tiger.' Similarly मुखपद्मम्, मुखकमलं, करकिसलयम्, पार्थिवचन्द्रम्॥\n\nThe words व्याघ्र  &c. are आकृतिगणः  i. e., this is a class of compound words, the fact of a word belonging to which, is known by its form, a posteriori and is not discoverable by any consideration of its constituent parts a priori.\n\nThe following is the list of such words:-  1. व्याघ्र  = A tiger. 2. सिंह  = A lion. 3. ऋक्ष = A bear. 4. ऋषभ = A bull. 5. चन्दन = Sandal. 6. वृक = A wolf. 7. वृष = A bull!. 8. वराह = A boar, hog. 9. हस्तिन = An elephant. 10. तरु  = A tree. 11. कुञ्जर = An elephant. 12. रुरु = A kind of deer. 13. पृषत = The spotted antelope. 14. पुण्डरीक = A lotus flower. 15. पलाश  = A tree Butea Frondosa. 16. कितव = A rogue, cheat.\n\nआकृतिगणोऽयम्\n\n1. मुखपद्मम्     A lotus-like face.\n2. मुखकमलम्     A lotus-like face.\n3. करकिसलयम् = Sprout-like hand, a tender hand. 4. पार्थिवचन्द्रः .",
    "21057": "The 'discriminator' is called विशेषण and the 'discriminated' is called विशेष्य as नीलोत्पलं 'a blue lotus,' रक्तोत्पलं 'a red lotus.'\n\nBy using in the rule the expression बहुल ' diversely' it is meant that in some cases it is imperative to make a compound (नित्यसमास) as कृष्णसर्पः 'a black snake.' लोहितशालिः 'red rice':-and sometimes it is forbidden; as, रामो जामदग्न्यः '_Rama_ called also _Jamadagnya_' (as being the son of _Jamadagni_): अर्जुनः कार्त्तवीर्यः -and in some cases it is optional, नीलमुत्पलं or नीलोत्पलं. \n\nWhy do we say 'qualifier ?'

The very use of this phrase in the aphorism shows that the word कतम has other meanings besides that of an interrogative pronoun, of determining _játi_; as कतरो भवतोर्देवदत्तः ‘which of you two, Sirs, is _Devadatta_,' and कतमो भवतां देवदत्तः ‘which of you, Sirs, is _Devadatta_.’ Here there is no questioning about _játi_; all belonging to the same genus, hence there is no compounding.

    "22007": "It should be stated that the word ईषत् is only compounded with words expressing qualities (adjectives), as ईषत्कडारः 'a somewhat proud.' ईषत्पिङ्गलः 'a little brownish.' ईषत्विकटः 'a little hideous.' ईषदुन्नतः 'a little raised.' ईषत् पीतम्  'a little yellow.' ईषद्रक्तम् 'a little red.'\n\nWhy do we say 'with words expressing qualities'? Observe ईषद्गार्ग्यः ; there is no compounding here.",
    "22008": "As राजः पुरुषो=राजपुरुषः 'the king's man' ब्राह्मणकम्बलः 'the _Brahmana_'s blanket.'\n\nVart:-When a word takes the genitive case because of its connection with a word ending in a _krit_ affix; that word may be compounded with such a _krit_ word. Rule (II. 3. 65)., states the conditions when a _krit_-formed word governs the genitive case. Thus इक्ष्मप्रवश्चनः 'a hatchet' (a fuel cutter), पलाशशातनः 'Palasadestroyer.'\n\nWhy do we say so? The very fact that a special rule has been made for the compounding of genitive cases governed by _krit_-nouns, shows that other words which take genitive case by some special rule, are not so compounded. Such as the genitive cases ordained by (II. 3. 38, 51, 52). In fact the genitive case ordained by any rule of Panini, other than (II. 3. 51), is a '_pratipadavidhana_' genitive; and a word taking genitive case according to those rules, is incapable of composition; see _vårtika_ under (II. 2. 10).",
    "22009": "The compound which was ordained by the last aphorism, would have been prohibited by Rule 16 in the case of याजक &c.; hence the necessity of the present aphorism to guard against such a prohibition. As ब्राह्मणबाजकः 'a Brahmana's sacrificer.' क्षत्रिययाजकः 'one who sacrifices for Kshatriyas'.\n\n(याजकादि)\n1.याजक. 2. पूजक . 3. परिचारक. 4. परिवेषक. 5. परिषेचक. 6.स्नापक or स्नातक. 7.अध्यापक. 8. उत्साहक or उत्सादक. 9. उद्वर्तक. 10. होतृ.  11. नर्तृ . 12. रथगणक. 13. पत्तिगणक. 14. पोतृ.  15. हतृ. 16. वर्तक.\n\nVart:-A word in the genitive case is compounded with a word expressing a quality which abides in the former word. As ब्राह्मणवर्णः '_Brahmana_-caste.' चंदनगन्धः 'sandal-scent.' कपित्थरसः 'the wood-apple juice.'\n\nVart:-So also with an adjective in the comparative degree ; and the sign of comparison तर is elided. Thus सर्वेषां श्वेततरः = सर्वश्वेतः 'the whitest of all.' सर्वेषां महत्तरः = सर्वमहान्  'the greatest among all.' This '_vartika_' is an exception in anticipation to the next _sutra_ which prohibits composition, when the genitive has the force of specification. Thus सर्वशुक्ला गौः 'a cow whitest among all.'",
    "22010": "With this sutra, begins a series of exceptions to the composition of words in the genitive case. The separation of one from the many, on account of its genus, attribute and action, is called '_nirdharana_.' As क्षत्रियो मनुष्याणां शूरतमः 'the _Kshatriya_ is the most powerful amongst men.' कृष्णा गवां संपन्नक्षीरतमः 'the black cow is the most milk-giving amongst cows.' धावन्नधगानां शीघ्रतमः 'the runner is the swiftest amongst walkers.' This form of genitive meaning 'amongst,' is ordained by _sutra_ (II. 3. 41).\n\nVart:- A word taking a genitive-case by force of any rule other than _sutra_ (II. 3. 50), is never compounded. See _sutra_ 8. Thus the following words are never compounded सर्पिषोज्ञानम् , मधुनोज्ञानम्.",
    "22011": "The word '_artha_' joins with all the first three words, as (1) छात्राणां पंचम. 'fifth amongst the pupils;' छात्राणां दशम. (2) काकस्य कार्ष्ण्यम् 'the blackness of the crow,' वलाकायाः शौक्ल्यम्. (3) फलानां सुहितः 'satisfied of fruits; फलानां तृप्तः. (4) ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वन्  'the doing of a _Brahmana_ ; ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वाणः 'the doing of a _Brahmana_'. (5) ब्राह्मणस्य कृत्वा 'being done of _Brahmana_,' ब्राह्मणस्य हुत्वा. (6) ब्राह्मणस्य कर्तव्यम्. When however the affix is तव्यम् having the indicatory त् (III. 1. 96.) there is compounding as ब्राह्मणकर्तव्यं  'the _Brahmana's duty' (7) राज्ञः पाटलिपुत्रकस्य 'of the king _Pataliputraka_' पाणिनेः सूत्रकारस्य 'of the _sutra_ composer _Panini_. We can however form a compound like the following a सूत्रकारपाणिनिः । By the general rule relating to words in apposition contained in _sūtra_ (II. 1. 57), the difference between that _sutra_ and the present, is as to position of the words. In the genitive compound the genitive word would have stood first if compounded; not so in the other, there the quality stands first.",
    "22012": "The affix क्त is added in the sense of inclination, understanding or respect by _sutra_ (III. 2. 188). The present _sutra_ alludes to that aphorism when it uses the word पूजाः and puja itself is used only as an illustration and includes the other two significations of '_kta_' also, namely _mati_ 'inclination,' and buddhi 'understanding.'\n\nAs राज्ञां मतः -बुद्धः - पूजितः 'the king wishes, understands or respects.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning respect'? When '_kta_' has not this signification there is compounding. As छात्रहसितं 'pupil's laughing.'",
    "22013": "When the affix क्त is attached to roots denoting 'fixedness, motion or eating', it gives the sense of agent and of location in connection with the action denoted by the roots i.e., that the action is located by the agent in this or that site (III. 4. 76); as इदमेषां यातम् ' here they have gone.'  इदमेषां भुक्तम् 'here they have eaten.'",
    "22014": "The anuvritti of क्त does not extend to this aphorism. The word karma qualifies _shashthi_. _Sutra_ (II. 3. 66) declares the conditions when, instead of the accusative, the genitive may be employed i. e., when the agent and the object of the action denoted by the nouns formed by _krit_ affixes, are both used in a sentence, the object is put in the genitive case and not the agent; as आश्चर्यो गवां दोहोऽगोपालकेन 'the milking of cows without a cowherd is a wonder.' रोचते ओदनस्य भोजनं देवदत्तेन  'eating of rice agrees with Devadatta.' साधु खलु पयसः पानं देवदत्तेन 'the drinking of milk by Devadatta is indeed excellent.' विचित्रा सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनिना 'wonderful is the structure of sutras by Panini.",
    "22015": "The word '_kartari_' qualifies the genitive-case. The affix तृच् is taught in _sutra_ (III. 1. 133), and the affix अक is not a single affix; all affixes that have an element वृ are अक such as ण्वुवुल् or वुञ्  ओर् वुन् ( _sutra_ (VII. 1. 1.) ) Thus भवतः शायिका 'your honor's repose' भवत आशिका 'your eating' भवतोऽग्रगामिका 'your going in front.'\n\nThe affix तृच् is employed always in forming nouns of agency; hence there can be no example of a word in a genitive case having the force of an agent, governing another word also having the force of an agent. They therefore serves no purpose in this aphorism, but applies to the _sutra_s that follow.\n\nThe genitive has the force of an agent under conditions mentioned in (II. 3. 65).\n\nWhy do we say 'when it denotes agent'? Observe इक्षुभक्षिकां मे धारयसि .",
    "22016": "The word '_kartari_' qualifies the word '_aka_' only and not '_trich_,' for the latter always denotes the agent and nothing else.\n\nAs अपां क्षष्टा 'the creator of waters' पुरां भेत्ता 'the destroyer of cities' वज्रस्य भर्ता 'the holder of thunderbolt.'\n\nIt might be suggested that the word भर्तृ being read in the class of याजक (sutra 9) ought to be compounded. The word भर्तृ there means 'husband,' while in the example we have given, it means 'holder.'\n\nThe above are examples of words formed by तृच्. Now we shall give examples of words formed by अक, thus ओदनस्य भोजकः 'the eater of rice,' सक्तूनां पायकः 'the drinker of _saktu_.'",
    "22017": "This is a Nitya-samasa incapable of analysis. This anuvritti of the word 'na' which began with _sútra_ 10, does not extend further. The affix तृच्  never has the sense of sporting or livelihood; the only examples possible are of '_aka_.' Thus उद्दालकपुष्पभजिका 'a sort of game played by the people in the eastern districts in which _uddalaka_ flowers are broken or crushed.' So also वारणपुष्पप्रचायिका 'a play of gathering flowers.'\n\nSo also दन्तलेखकः 'one who earns his bread by painting or marking the teeth.' नखलेखक 'a nail-painter by profession.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning sporting or livelihood.' Observe ओदनस्य भोजकः.",
    "22018": "The word _ku_ means 'badness or sin' ; as, कुपुरुषः 'a sinful man' ; (2) _Gati_ (I. 4. 60) as, उररीकृतं 'having asserted'; (I. 4. 61.) यदूरीकरोति ॥\n\nSo also with the words प्र &c., when they are mere particles and not used as 'upasargas,' or 'gati'; as दूर् meaning 'bad,' in दुष्पुरुषः 'a bad man'; so also सु and अति meaning 'respect' in सुपुरुषः 'honorable man'; अतिपुरुषः 'excellent man' ; आ means 'a little' as आपिङ्कत्नः 'brownish.'\n\nGenerally these are attributive words but they are found elsewhere also, as कोष्यं or कदुष्णम् or कवोष्णन् 'tepid.' So also दुष्कृतम्, अतिस्तुतम् and आबद्धम् ॥",
    "22019": "Thus कुम्भकारः 'one who wakes pots,' नगरकारः 'one who makes cities.'\n\nWhy do we say 'which does not end with a tense-affix'? Observe एधानाहारको व्रजति 'he goes to bring fuel.'\n\nIt might be objected, that the question of compounding with a word ending in a tense-affix is irrelevant; since the _anuvritti_ of the words सुप् सुपा is understood here, so that तिङ्  will find no scope. To this we reply that we should infer that the words सुप् सुपा should not be read into this and the last aphorism. The following _Paribhasha_ also arises from this _sūtra_.\n\nगतिकारको पपदानां कृद्धिः सह समासाचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः ॥\n\n\"It should be stated that _Gatis_, _Karakas_, and _Upapadas_, are compounded with bases that end with _krit_-affixes, before a case-termination or feminine affix has been added to the latter.\"\n\nThe result is that _Upapadas_ and _Gatis_ are rot compounded by _sūtras_ 18 and 19 with case-infected nouns, but they are compounded with primary nouns before a case-termination or feminine affix is added to the latter. The same considerations apply to _karakas_ also. Thus अश्वक्रीती 'a female brought in exchange for a horse,' is formed correctly. अश्वेन क्रीयते सा = अश्वक्रीत ; add ङीष (IV. 1. 50) and we have अश्वक्रीती. If on the other hand, the feminine affix ate had beca added to क्रीत previous to its composition with अश्व the form would have been अश्वक्रीता, and we should have had no base ending with short अ and in that case ङीष् could not have been added by (IV. 1. 50).",
    "22020": "This makes a restriction, to the general compounding of _upapadas_ with _avyayas_ as ordained by the last rule. As स्वादुकारं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats having made his food sweet.' So also लवणकारं 'having seasoned. The _avyayas_ ending in अम् are formed by the affix ण्मुल् (III. 4. 26) &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'with _avyayas_       ending in अम्'?  Observe कालो भोक्तुम्  'the time of eating.' Here the _avyaya_ ends in उम् of the affix तुमुन् added by rule (III. 3. 167) (the affix _tumun_ may be applied, when the word in construction is not a verb, but काल, समय or वेला 'time.')\n\nThe force of the word only is to indicate that this composition takes place in those cases where a rule ordains अम् only, after any root with regard to any upapada; so that no composition will take place where the affix अम् as well as another affix is ordained after a root with certain _upapadas_. Thus _sutra_ (III. 4. 24), declares: \"the affixes क्त्वा and णमुल् come after a verb when the words अमे, प्रथम and पूर्व are _upapadas_.\" Here the अम् (affix णमुल्) is not the sole affix ordained; but there is a co-ordinate affix with it namely क्त्वा. Therefore in अग्रेभोजम् 'having first eaten' there is no composition because अग्रेभोजम् is not the only form we can have; for, अग्रेभुक्त्वा is also used in the same sense.",
    "22021": "The term अम् is understood here. The _upapadas_ ending with a third case-affix &c., are given in _sutra_ (III. 4. 47) and the sutras that follow. As मूलकोपदंशं मुङ्क्ते or मूलकेनोपदंशं भुङ्क्ते  'he eats after having relished the food with radish.' So also पार्श्वोपपीड or पार्श्वयोरुपपीडम् शेते (Ill. 4. 49) 'he lies pressing on his ribs.' For _upapadas_ ending with other cases, see _sutra_  (III. 4. 52) &c. This being an optional rule, it is not necessary that the _upapada_ should be _tulya-vidhana_ with the अम् ; so that this optional compounding may take place even under rule (III. 4. 59) where अम् is not the only affix enjoined, but there is क्त्वा as well. This _vibhasha_ may therefore be called both प्राप्त and अप्राप्त _vibhasha_. It is प्राप्त with regard to those rules where अम् is the only affix employed; and it is अप्राप्त with regard to those where श्रम् is not the only affix.",
    "22022": "This rule provides for _avyayas_ ending in क्त्वा which the last two rules did not provide. Thus we have उच्चैः कृत्य or उच्चैः कृत्वा. Here the affix क्त्वा is added by _sutra_ (III. 4. 59.) In the case when there is composition, the क्त्वा is replaced by the substitute ल्यप्  ; otherwise not. See (VII. I. 37).\n\nThe condition of the _upapadas_ being in the 3rd case &c., applies here also. Therefore there is no composition in अलं कृत्वा or खलु कृत्वा.",
    "22023": "A compound which does not fall within any one of the rules given above, will be _Bahuvrihi_. This is a governing aphorism and extends up to _sūtra_ 28. Thus चित्रगुः 'possessed of a brindled cow.'",
    "22024": "The _Bahuvrihi_ compound comes with the force of all the affixes but the first; as प्राप्तमुदकं ग्रामं = प्राप्तोदको ग्रामः 'a water-reached village. ' ऊढरथोऽनड्वान्  'a bull by whom a cart is drawn.'  'उपहृतपशूरुद्रः 'Rudra to whom cattle is offered,' उदृतौदना स्थाली 'a vessel which rice is placed.' चित्रगुर्देवदत्तः 'Devadatta possessed of a brindled cow.' वीरपुरुषको ग्रामः 'a village possessed of heroic men.'\n\n_Bahuvrihi_ compound is not formed with the sense of the first case. As वृष्टे देवे गतः 'gone when it had rained.'\n\nWhy do we say 'more than one'? So that there may be compounding of many words, as in the following verse:-\n\nसुसूक्ष्मजटकेशेन सुञभाजिनवाससा। पुत्री पर्वतराजस्य कुतो हेतोर्विवाहिता ॥.\n\n'Why was the daughter of the king of the mountains married by _Siva_ possessed of beautifully-delicate-locked-hair, and cheap deer-skin-dress.'",
    "22025": "Thus उपदशाः (V. 4. 73) ’those who are near ten i.e. nine or eleven.' Similarly उपविंशः 'nineteen or twenty-one' (VI. 4. 142). So also आसन्नदशाः 'nine or eleven.' अदूरदशाः 'nine or eleven.' अधिकदशाः 'eleven.'\n\nSo also two 'numerals' may be compounded; as, द्वित्राः 'two or three.' द्विदशाः 'twenty.'\n\nWhy do we say with a numeral'? Observe पंच ब्राह्मणाः 'five Brahmanas.' \n\nWhy do we say 'with an Indeclinable &c'? Witness ब्राह्मणाः पंच. Why do we say 'when denoting a numeral'? Observc अधिका विंशतिर्गवाम्' of cows more than twenty.'",
    "22026": "Thus दक्षिणपूर्वादिक् _dakshina-purva_, 'south-east,' (the direction midway between south and east.) पूर्वोत्तरा 'north-east.'\n\nThe word नाम is introduced in the sūtra to indicate that no compounding takes place when the words denoting direction are derivative words whose primary signification is not indicative of direction; as ऐन्द्र्यश्चकौबेर्याश्च दिशोर्यदन्तरालम् ' the point between cast and north'. Here the words ऐन्द्री 'east' and कौबेरी 'north' though denoting directions, are derivatively so, and hence no compounding.",
    "22027": "The word तत्र means 'a word in the locative case,' and तेन 'a word in the instrumental case.' The word सरूप or 'similar form' applies to both. The word इति indicates that the meaning of the compound so formed should be learned from popular usage, therefore it means, 'seizing, striking, fighting.' All these senses are implied by इति. The word is exhibited in the locative case, if the sense is that of seizing; and the word is exhibited in the instrumental case, when the sense is that of striking; the word indicated by the word इदमिति is युद्ध; as केरोषुकेशोषु च गृहीत्वा इदं युद्ध वृत्तं = केशाकेशि (VI. 3. 137) and (V.4. 127.) ' hair to hair, fighting by pulling each other's hair'; कचाकचि 'hair  against hair'; दण्डैश्च दण्डैश्च प्रहृत्य इदं युद्धं वृत्तं = दण्दादण्डि 'stick against stick, fight with stick and stave;' so also मूशलामूशली. In the above examples the samasanta affix is added at the end by rule (V. 4. 127); and all such words are Aryaya or indeclinable. The final vowel of the first term is lengthened by Rule (VI. 3. 137).\n\nWhy do we say 'having the same form'? We cannot form such a compound from the following : हलैश्च मुषलैश्च प्रहृत्य इदं युद्धं वृत्तम् .",
    "22028": "Thus सह पुत्रोणागतः=सपुत्रः ( (VI. 3. 82), सह changed to स ) 'he has come accompanied by his son'. सच्छात्रः 'accompanied by the pupil.' सकर्मकरः 'accompanied by the servant.'\n\nWhy do we say '_tulya_-_yoga_'? Witness 'the she-ass carries the whole burden, though there exist her ten sons.'\n\nHow do we get the forms like  सकर्मकः, सलोमकः, सपक्षकः &c., in which there is no '_tulya_-_yoga_'? It shows that this condition is of limited operation (तुल्य गोगबचनं प्रायिकं).",
    "22029": "The meanings that may be indicated by च 'and' are four, (1) समुच्चयः 'community of reference,' (2) अन्वाचय 'collateralness of reference, (3) इतरेतरयोगः 'mutual conjunction' and (4) समाहारः  'aggregate.' In the first two cases viz., community of reference, and collateralness of reference, composition does not take place, because the words are not directly related to one another (II. I. I). Composition is enjoined therefore, when the sense of च is that of mutual conjunction and lumping. Thus we cannot compound ईश्वरं गुरुं च भजस्व 'reverence God and thy _Guru_' or भिक्षामट गां चानय 'go for alms and bring the cow.' But we can compound the following प्लक्षश्च न्यग्रोधश्च = प्लक्षन्यग्रोधौ 'the _Plaksha_ and the _Nyagrodha_ trees.' So धव-खदिर-पलाशाः , वाक्त्वचम्, वाग्दृषदम् ॥",
    "22030": "The word समासे is understood here. The _upasarjana_ being the word exhibited in the nominative case in the rules relating to _samasa_, must stand first. The constant application of this rule has been illustrated in the previous aphorisms. Without this rule, there would have been no fixity as to the position of words.",
    "22031": "Thus राजदन्तः (दन्तानां राजा) 'a chief of teeth' (i.e., an eyetooth). It is not merely the _upasarjana_ that is placed last in these examples; but words which by some other rules would have stood first, stand in this list as second.\n\n1. राजदन्तः. 2. अग्रेवणम् . 3. निमवासिनम् . 4. नग्नमुषितम् . 5. सिक्तसंमृष्टम् . 6.मृष्टलुञ्चितम् . 7. अवक्लिन्नपक्वमे. 8. अर्पितोतम् . 9.

    "23001": "Whatever will be taught from this point forward, should be understood to apply to those cases which have not been specified otherwise. The case-affixes like those denoting 'object' 'instrument' &c., are applied to a noun, only then, when the force of the case-affix is not otherwise denoted or mentioned or exhibited. The force of a case-affix may be so denoted either by first, the conjugational affixes तिङ्; secondly, by the Primary affixes or कृत्, thirdly, by the secondary affixes तद्धित; or lastly by compounds. Thus _sutra_ 2 declares that the second case-affix is applied in denoting the object, as कटं करोति 'he makes the mat'; ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village.' But the object can otherwise be denoted. Thus by the passive conjugational affix, as कृयते कटः 'the mat is made.' Here the termination of the verb denotes the object. See _sutra_ (I. 3. 18). and (III. 4. 69). So also by the _krit_ affix, as कृतः कटः 'the mat is made,' see _Sutra_ (III. 4. 70). So also by a _Taddhita_ affix as शत्य or शतिकः meaning 'purchased with a hundred' = शतेन क्रीतः. Similarly by _samasa_, as प्राप्तमुदकं ग्रामम् = प्राप्तोदको ग्रामः ॥",
    "23002": "The terms _dvitiya_ &c., are technical phraseology of older grammarians, and hence not defined by _Panini_; they apply to the triads of सुप् affixes. कटं करोति 'he makes the mat,' ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village.'\n\nThe words उभयतः, सर्वतः, धिक् and the double forms उपर्युपरि, अधोधः, अध्यधि, when they have the sense of nearness, govern the accusative. Sometimes other cases also, as उभयतो ग्रामं 'on both sides of the village'; सर्वतो ग्रामं 'on all sides of the village'; धिग्देवदत्तं 'fie to _Devadatta_'; उपर्युपरि ग्रामम् 'just over the village'; अध्यधि or अधोधो ग्रामम् 'just below the village.'\n\nVart:- The words अभितः, परितः both meaning 'round', समया, निकषा both meaning 'near', and हा 'woe be to,' and प्रति 'to,' govern the accusative case; as, अभितो ग्रामम् 'round the village,' ग्रामं समया 'near the village'; हा देवदत्तं 'woe be to _Devadatta_'; बुभुक्षितम् न प्रतिभाति किंचित् 'to a hungry person nothing occurs to his mind.' See (I. 4. 49) &c.",
    "23003": "This ordains the third case-affix, and by force of the word च 'and' the second case-affix is also employed as यवाग्वाग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he satisfies or pleases _Agni_ with barley-powder,' or यवागुमग्निहोत्रं जुहोति 'he throws barley-powder into the fire as oblation.'\n\nWhy do we say 'in the vedas?' In the classical Sanskrit, the accusative only must be used and not the instrumental.",
    "23004": "The _anuvritti_ of _dvitiya_ is understand here and not that of _tritiya_. Both these words _antara_ and _antarena_ are _Nipatas_. They govern the accusative. This debars the genitive case. The word _antara_ means 'between' while _antarena_ means 'besides that,' 'without,' 'exception,' 'with reference to' 'regarding.' As, अन्तरेण पुरुषकारं न किंचिल्लभ्यते nothing can be gained without exertion. अन्तरा or अन्तरेण त्वां च मां च कमंडलुः 'the bowl is between thee and me.' कोऽन्यस्त्वां मां तरेण शक्तः प्रतिकर्तुम् 'who else but thee is able to retaliate.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when joined with ?' Observe अन्तरा तक्षशिलां च पाटलिपुत्रं स्रुघ्नस्य प्राकारः.",
    "23005": "मासमधीते 'he reads for a month,' 'he studies full one month,' मासं कल्याणी 'prosperous during the month' (uninterruptedly), संवत्सरं पुष्पाः 'flowers during the year continually,' क्रोशं कुटिला नदी 'the river winding for one _kos_ without any break,' क्रोशं पर्वतः 'the hill through one full _kos_.' सभा वैश्रवणी राजन् शतयोजनमायता 'O king the hall of _Visravana_ is 100 _yojanas_ in length.'\n\nThe word अत्यन्तसंयोग or 'full continuity' means the complete relation of time or space with its action, attribute or substance.\n\nWhy do we say '_atyanta_-_sanyoga_ or complete continuity'? Observe मासस्य द्विरधीते or क्रोशस्यैकदेशे पर्वतः ॥",
    "23006": "मासेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the _Anuvaka_ in a month,' क्रोशेनानुवाकोऽधीतः 'he learnt the _Anuvaka_ by going over a _kos_.\n\nThe word अपवर्ग means 'the finishing of an action, on the attainment of the object intended by the action, but not before.' Thus संवत्सरेणानुवाकोऽधीतः means '_Anuvaka_ was persaveringly and effectually read by him in the whole year.'\n\nWhen the idea of _apavarga_ is not intended, the accusative case is employed, as मासमधीतोऽनुवाकः 'learnt for a month, but not yet completed, the _Anuvaka_.'",
    "23007": "Ex. अद्य भुक्त्वा देवदत्तो द्व्यहे द्व्यहाद्वाभोक्ता 'having dined today, _Devadatta_ will dine in or after two days.' Here the 'time' is the interval between the agent and his power of eating. So also इहस्थोऽयमिष्वासः क्रोशात् क्रोशे वा लक्ष्यं विध्येत् 'standing here, he will hit a mark at the distance of one _kos_. Here _kos_ is the interval between the agent and the object or the object and the ablation, or the object and the location. The rule (1. 3. 10) does not apply here.",
    "23008": "Ex. शाकल्यस्य संहितामनुप्रावर्षत् 'It rained on (hearing) the reading of the _Veda_ by _Sakalya_.' So also आगस्त्यमन्वसिंचत् प्रजाः ॥",
    "23009": "Ex. उपखार्याम् द्रोणः 'A _Drona_ is more than a _Khari_,' अधिब्रह्मदत्ते पंचालाः '_Brahmadatta_ is the lord of _Panchalas_.' The phrase यस्यचेश्वरवचनं indicate that both the thing owned and the owner may be in the locative. See (1.4.97).\n\nThis aphorism debars the accusative.",
    "23010": "Ex. अप or आ or परि पाटलिपुत्रादावृष्टो देवः 'It rained off or upto or with the exclusion of, _Pataliputra_.'\n\nThe परि here has the meaning of 'exclusion' (I. 4. 88) being read along with अप, therefore, not here वृक्षं परि विद्योतते विद्युत् (I. 4. 90).",
    "23011": "Ex. अभिमन्युरर्जुनतः प्रति '_Abhimanyu_ is the representative of _Arjuna_.' माषानस्मैतिलेभ्यः प्रतियच्छति 'he exchanges _mashas_ for this sesamum.' See (I. 4.92) for an explanation of प्रतिनिधि and प्रतिदान.",
    "23012": "Ex. ग्रामं or ग्रामाय गच्छति 'he goes to the village.' But not so in मनसा हरिं व्रजति (the verb not denoting physical motion) 'he goes mentally to _Hari_' अध्वानं गच्छति 'he goes over the way' (the object being the 'way'). But not so in ओदनं पचति 'he cooks rice;' (the verb not denoting 'motion') nor in अश्वेन व्रजति (the verb not denoting 'the object.')\n\nNote.- The word _adhvan_ includes the synonyms of road (1. 1. 68) as पन्थानं गच्छति, मार्गं गच्छति.\n\nNote.- The prohibition applies with regard to the going over or occupying the road; so that where a person from a wrong road goes to the right road, there the fourth case-affix will be employed as पथे गच्छति.",
    "23013": "Ex. उपाध्यायाय गां ददाति 'He gives a cow to the teacher' देवदत्ताय रोचते 'it pleases _Devadatta_' (I. 4. 33) पुष्पेभ्यः स्पृहयति (I. 4.36) 'he desires flowers.'\n\nVart:- The fourth case-affix should be employed when the sense is that of 'for the purpose thereof' as यूपाय दारु 'wood is for making posts.' कुण्डलाय हिरण्यं 'gold used for the purpose of making ear-ring.' रन्धनाय स्थाली 'pot for the sake of cooking.' अवहननायोलूखलं 'mortar for the sake of threshing.'\n\nVart:- The verb क्लृप and other verbs meaning 'to be fit or adequate for, result in, bring about, accomplish, produce, tend to,' govern the dative case: as, मूत्राय कल्पते यवागूः 'the barley gruel tends to produce urine.' So elso मूत्राय संपद्यते जायते वा यवागुः.  \n\nVart:- The fourth case-affix is employed with the force of 'indicating a portent or calamity.' as.\n\nवाताय कपिला विद्युदातपायाति लोहिनी ॥\nपीता वर्षाय विज्ञेया दुर्भिक्षाय सिता भवेत् ॥\n\n'The reddish lightening portends wind, extremely red indicates heat, yellow portends rain and white lightening prognosticates famine.'\n\nVart:- The fourth case-affix should be employed in connection with the word हितः as गोभ्योहितं 'good for cows.'",
    "23014": "In other words, when the sense of an infinitive of purpose formed by '_tumun_' and '_nvul_' (III. 3. 10,) is suppressed in a sentence, the object of this infinitive is put in the Dative case.\n\nफलेभ्यो व्रजति = फलान्याहर्तुं व्रजति 'he goes for fruits i. e., to bring fruits.' This debars the accusative case. So also we have in एधेभ्यः व्रजति 'he goes for fuel.' The words क्रियार्थोपदस्य and स्थानिनः are in apposition. The first is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound of क्रियार्थ + उपपद and means 'a verb whose _upapada_ denotes the purpose of the action (_kriyartha_).' Thus in एधानाहर्तुम् 'to bring fuel'; the infinitive verb आहर्तुम् is क्रियार्थोपपद, the object of this verb is एधः when this verb is suppressed, it becomes स्थानिनः; the object of this verb takes the fourth case-affix.\n\nWhy do we say 'of the verb whose _upadada_ denotes the purpose of the action'? Observe प्रविश पिंडीम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'in denoting the object.' Witness एधेभ्यो व्रजति शकटेन 'for fuel he goes with a cart.'\n\nWhy do we 'when suppressed'? Observe एधानाहर्तुं व्रजति.",
    "23015": "Ex. यागाय व्रजति 'he goes to offer a sacrifice' = यष्टुं व्रजति. So also त्यागाय व्रजति, भूतये व्रजति.\n\nThe word तुमर्थ means 'having the same significance as the affix तुम्.'",
    "23016": "Ex. नमो देवेभ्यः, स्वस्ति प्रजाभ्यः, स्वादाऽग्नये, स्वधा पितृभ्यः, अलं मल्लो मल्लाय 'Salutation to Gods'; 'peace to the people'; '_svaha_ to fire'; '_svadha_ to the _Pitris_'; 'an athlete is a match for an athlete' &c. The word अलं includes its synonyms also, as प्रभुः, शक्तः &c.; so वषडिन्द्राय, वषडग्नये.\n\nThe च indicates that the Dative will debar Genitive, in spite of (II. 3. 73), in the case of these words, though used benedictivley; as स्वस्ति गोभ्यो भूयात् ॥",
    "23017": "Ex. न त्वा तृणं तृणाय वा मन्ये 'I do not consider thee worth a straw.' न त्वा बुसं बुसाय वा मन्ये 'I do not consider thee worth a chaff.' Why do we use the word मन्ये? Observe न त्वा तृणं चिन्तयामि. The optional dative will not be employed with the synonyms of the verb मन्यति. So also the _sutra_ uses the form मन्य with the _vikarana_ श्यण्, indicating that it is _Divadi_ that governs a dative, and not the _Tanadi_ मन्; for the latter governs the accusative only, as न त्वां तृणं मन्ये.\n\nWhen contempt is not meant, the verb does not govern the Dative, as:-\n\nअश्मानं दृषदं मन्ये, मन्ये काष्ठमुलूखलम् । अन्धायास्तं सुतं मन्ये यस्य माता न पश्यति ॥\n\n'I consider a rock to be a stone, I consider mortar but as wood, I consider him to be the son of a blind woman whose mother cannot see.'\n\nSo also when the object of comparison is an animate being, it will not take the dative:- as न त्वां शृगालं मन्ये 'I do not consider thee even as a jackal.' The case of न त्वां शुने मन्ये is an exception.\n\nVart:- Instead of using अप्राणिषु in the _sutra_, the words अनावादिषु should be used. The following words belong to _Navadi_ class, they are always in the accusative after the word मन्ये, never in the Dative :-- नो 'ship,' काक 'crow,' अन्न 'food,' शुक 'parrot,' and शृगाल 'jackal.'",
    "23018": "Ex. देवदत्तेन कृतं 'done by _Devadatta_,' दात्रेण लुनाति 'he cuts with the sickle.' So also यज्ञदत्तेन भुक्तम्, परशुना छिनत्ति ॥\n\nVart:- The following words take the 3rd case. प्रकृति 'original,' प्राय 'almost,' गोत्र '_gotra_,' सम 'equal,' विषम 'unequal,' द्विद्रोण, पंचक and साहस्र as प्रायेण याज्ञिकः, गार्ग्योऽस्मि गोत्रेण, समेन or विषमेण धावति, द्विद्रोणेन क्रीणाति &c.",
    "23019": "Ex. पुत्रेण सहागतः पिता 'the father has come with the son.'\n\nThe same will be the result with the synonyms of सह as, पुत्रेण सार्द्धं 'with the son'. So also when the word सह is understood, as _Panini_ himself uses in (I. 2. 65) वृद्धो युना &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not the principal.' Observe, शिष्येण सहोपाध्यायस्य गौः.",
    "23020": "As, अक्ष्णा काणः 'blind of one eye' पादेन खंजः 'lame of foot.' पाणिना कुण्ठः &c. The word _anga_ in this _sutra_ applies to the whole body, whatsoever by reason of being a member of the body is defective is indicated here.",
    "23021": "जटाभिस्तापसः 'he is an ascetic by (the fact of his having) matted hair.' अपि भवान् कमण्डलुना छात्रमद्राक्षीत् 'your honor might see the student by the fact of his having a _kamandalu_.' So also छात्रेणोपाध्यायम् 'a teacher by the fact of having students.' शिखया परिव्राजकम् 'a _Parivrajaka_ by a tuft of hair.' But not so here, कमण्डलुपाणिछात्रः ' a student has _kamandalu_ in his hand.' Because here in the compound, कमण्डलुपाणि is hidden the mark.\n\nWhy do we say _ittha_-_bhuta_? Observe वृक्षं प्रति विद्योतनं.",
    "23022": "पित्रा or पितरं संजानीते 'he knows his father.' मात्रा or मातरं संजानीते ॥",
    "23023": "विद्यया यशः 'by learning there is produced fame.' धनेन कुलम् 'by wealth, family;' कन्यया शोकः 'by daughter there is grief.'\n\nThe word हेतु here is used in its popular sense and not the grammatical _hetu_ (I. 4. 55). Any  thing capable of accomplishing a desired object is called _hetu_.",
    "23024": "Ex. शताद्बद्धः 'he has been bound on account of a debt of a hundred pieces.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when not denoting the agent ?' Observe शतेन बन्धितः; 'a debt of hundred has thrown him in prison'; here शत being considered as a _prayojaka_ _hetu_, is an agent and takes the third case-affix.",
    "23025": "Ex. जाड्येन जाड्यताम् वा बद्धः 'he has been bound by reason of his dullness.' पांडित्येन or पांडित्याद् मुक्तः 'saved through learning.'\n\n_Guna_-_vachana_ nouns are generally abstract nouns. Therefore not here धनेन कुलम्. If an abstract noun is of feminine gender, this rule will not apply, as वुद्ध्या or प्रज्ञया मुक्तः 'he was set at liberty on account of his skill or wisdom.'",
    "23026": "Ex. अन्नस्य हेतोर्वसति 'he dwells for the sake of food.'",
    "23027": "Ex. कस्य or केन हेतुना वसति 'for the sake of what does he live?' यस्य or येन हेतुना वसति ।\n\nVart:- When the words निमित्त or कारण are so used, almost all the case affixes may be employed; as किं निमित्तं or केन निमित्तेन or कस्मै निमित्ताय or कस्मान्निमित्तात् or कस्मिन् निमित्ते वसति. Similarly with the words _karana_ and _hetu_. Here also the word हेतु does not mean the word-form _hetu_ (I. 1. 68) bub its synonyms also; as किं प्रयोजनं or केन प्रयोजनेन or कस्मै प्रयोजनाय &c., वसति.",
    "23028": "Ex. ग्रामादागच्छति 'he comes from the village' (I. 4. 24); वृकेभ्यो बिभेति (I. 4. 25), अध्ययनात् पराजयते (I. 4. 26) &c.\n\nVart:- The fifth case-affix is employed in denoting the object, when the verbal participle ending in ल्यप् is elided; as प्रासादमारुह्य प्रेक्षते = प्रासादात् प्रेक्षते 'he sees from a palace.'\n\nVart:- And under similar circumstances in denoting the location the place where an action is performed is put in the ablative case, as, आसने उपविश्य प्रेक्षते = आसनात् प्रेक्षते 'he sees from a seat.'\n\nVart:- In questions and answers, the fifth case-affix is employed:- कुतो भवान् ? पाटलिपुत्राद् 'whence is your Honor coming? From _Pataliputra_'\n\nVart:- That point of time or space from which distance in time or space is measured is put in the ablative case:-as, गवीधूमतः सांकाश्यं चत्वारि योजनानि '_Sankasya_ is from _Gavidhuma_ four _yojanas_.' कार्त्तिक्या आग्रहायणी मासे '_Agrahayana_ is one month from _Kartika_. The word denoting the distance in time is put in the locative case, as मासे\n\nVart:- In the above the word denoting the distance in space may be put either in the nominative or locative; as गवीधूमतः सांकाश्यं चत्वारि योजनानि or चतुर्षु योजनेषु ।",
    "23029": "Ex. अन्यो, भिन्नो, इतरो, अर्थान्तरं, विलक्षणो  वा देवदत्तात् 'different from _Devadatta_' आराद् देवदत्तात् 'remote from or near to _Devadatta_.' The word _arat_ meaning 'near or remote' would have taken the sixth case-affix by _sutra_ 34, but this enjoins 5th case-affix. ऋते देवदत्तात्  'excepting _Devadatta_.' पूर्वो ग्रामात् 'east of the village,' उत्तरो ग्रामात् 'north of the village,' पूर्वो ग्रीष्मात् वसन्तः 'the spring is prior to summer' प्राक् प्रत्यग्वा ग्रामात् 'to the east or west of the village' दक्षिणा दक्षिणाहि वा ग्रामात् 'to the south or in the eastern direction of the village.'\n\nThe words like प्राक् &c., formed from the verb _anchu_ are also दिक्शब्दः; their separate enumeration shows that the sixth case-affix ordained by the next _sutra_ does not come after them.",
    "23030": "The affix अतसुच् is ordained by (V. 3. 28).\n\nEx. ग्रामस्य दक्षिणतः उत्तरतः पुरस्तात् उपरि वा 'to the south or north, foremost, in or above the village.'",
    "23031": "Ex. दक्षिणेन ग्रामम् ग्रामस्य वा 'south of the village.'",
    "23032": "Ex. रामाद्रामेण रामं वा विना पृथग् नाना वा 'without or different from _Rama_.'\n\nThis _sutra_ may be divided into two parts:- (1) पृथग् विना नानाभिः (2) तृतीयाऽन्यतरस्याम्. By this arrangement we can read _dvitiya_ into the aphorism.\n\nविना वातं विना वर्षं विद्युत्प्रपतनं विना ।\nविना हस्ति कृतान्दोषान् केनेमौ पातितौ द्रुमौ ॥",
    "23033": "Ex. स्तोकात् स्तोकेन वा मुक्तः and अल्पान्मुक्तः or अल्पेनमुक्तः &c, 'he got off easily &c. But स्तोकेन विषेन हतः, अल्पेन मधुना मत्तः &c. 'killed by a little poison.' No option allowed, as it qualifies a substance. So also स्तोकं मुञ्चति 'he loosens a little.' Here स्तोक is used as an adverb and not as an instrument (करण).",
    "23034": "Ex. ग्रामाद् ग्रामस्य वा वनं दूरं विप्रकृष्टं, अन्तिकं, अभ्याशं, निकटं समीपं वा 'the forest is distant or near or to the village.'\n\nThe force of the word अन्यतरस्यां is to indicate that the 5th case-affix employed in the alternative, would have run into this _sutra_, had we not used '_anyatarasyam_.'",
    "23035": "Ex. दूरं दूराद् दूरेण वा ग्रामस्य and अन्तिकात्, or अन्तिकेन अन्तिकं ग्रामस्य.\n\nThis rule applies only when these words have their original signification and do not denote a substance. Otherwise the proper case-affix should be employed, as दूरः पन्थाः, दूराय पथे देहि.",
    "23036": "Ex. कटे आस्ते 'he sits on the mat' अन्तिके दूरे वा ग्रामस्य 'near or distant from the village.' स्थाल्यां पचति 'he cooks in the pot.' Thus the words दूर and अन्तिक take four case-affixes, namely the second, third, fifth and seventh.\nVart:- Words like अधीतिन् 'who has learnt,' गृहीतिन् 'who has comprehended;' i. e., words formed by adding इन् to the past participle in क्त, govern the locative of that which forms their object:- as अधीती व्याकरणे 'versed in grammar.' परिगणिती यज्ञिके 'well versed in sacrificial rites.' आम्नान्ती छन्दसि 'well read in the _Veda_.' See (V. 2. 88).\n\nVart:- The words साधु and असाधु govern the locative of that towards whom goodness or otherwise is shown; as मातरि साधुरसाधु वा 'well behaved or ill-behaved towards his mother.'\n\nVart:- The Locative absolute is used in cases other than those specified in the next _sutra_, namely, in cases where the action done or suffered does not indicate the time of another action; as ऋद्धेषु भुञ्जानेषु दरिद्रा आसते 'the poor are sitting, while the rich are eating,' दरिद्रेषु आसीनेषु ऋद्धाभुञ्जते 'the rich are eating, while the poor being seated.' So also vice versa.\n\nVart:- The Locative is sometimes used to denote the object or purpose for which anything is done; as.\n\nचर्मणि द्वीपिनं हंति, दंतयोर्हन्तिकुंजरम् ।\nकेशेषु चमरीं हंति सोम्नि पुष्कलको हतः ॥\n\n'Man kills the tiger for his skin, the elephant for his tusks, for _chamari_ cow for her hair, and the musk-deer for its musk.'",
    "23037": "This is Locative Absolute. गोषु दुह्यमानासु गतः 'the cows being milked, he went away' दुग्धास्वागतः 'and returned when they were milked'. अग्निषु हूयमानेषु गतः, हुतेष्वागतः.\n\nWhy do we say 'by the action of whatsoever'? Observe यो जटाभिः स भुक्ते. Why have we used the word 'action' twice? Witness यो भुक्ते स देवदत्तः.",
    "23038": "This is Genitive Absolute. रुदतः रुदति वा प्राव्राजीत् 'in spite of her weeping, he went away.' The force of this genitive is that of the English word 'not withstanding' 'in spite of' 'for all,' &c., नन्दाः पशव इव हताः पश्यतो राक्षसस्य 'the _Nandas_ were killed like so many beasts _Rakshasa_ looking on,' (not-with-standing that _Rakshasa_ was looking on).",
    "23039": "गवां गोषु वा स्वामी or ईश्वर 'master of cows.' So also गवामधिपतिः or गोष्वधिपतिः, गवां दायादः or गोषु दायादः, गवां or गोषु साक्षी प्रतिभूः &c.\n\nThese words naturally would have governed the Genitive; the present _sutra_ ordains Locative as well.",
    "23040": "Ex. आयुक्तः कुशलो वा कटकरणे कटकरणस्य वा 'deeply absorbed in mat-making.'\n\nWhen not meaning 'deeply absorbed,' the construction is different; as आयुक्तो गौ शकटे 'the cow is slightly yoked to the cart.' Here the seventh case-affix only is employed.",
    "23041": "Ex. गवां गोषु वा कृष्णा बहुक्षीराः 'among cows the black one gives much milk,' मनुष्याणां or मनुष्येषु क्षत्रियः शूरतमः.\n\nA _nirdharana_ or specification is made by separating one from the many by reason of its genus, quality and action (II. 2. 10).",
    "23042": "This debars the sixth and the seventh case-affixes, as, माथुराः पाटलिपुत्रेभ्यः सुकुमारतराः '_Mathura_ is more beautiful than _Pataliputra_.'",
    "23043": "मातरि साधुः or निपुणः 'good behaved towards his mother'? But साधुर्देवदत्तो मातरं प्रति '_Devadatta_ is good behaved towards his mother.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when respect is denoted'? Observe, साधुर्भृत्योराज्ञः 'the servant is good towards the king.' Here it is a bare statement of a fact.\n\nThe exception applies not only to प्रति but to other prepositions, like परि, अनु &c., as, मातरं परि साधुर्देवदत्तः ॥",
    "23044": "Ex. निद्रायां निद्रया वा उत्सुकः 'longing for sleep,' केशैः or केशेषु प्रसितः",
    "23045": "Ex. पुष्येण पुष्ये वा पायसमश्नीयात् 'when the moon is in the Asterism of _Pushya_, let him drink milk.' See Rules (IV. 2. 4) and (IV. 2. 5). So also मघाभिः पललौदनं मघासु पललौदनम्. But not so here पंचालेषु वसति 'he lives in _Panchala_'. Here the country is meant, and not a star, though here also there is elision of the _Taddhita_ affix.\n\nWhy do we say '_lup_ elision'? Observe मघासु ग्रहः 'the planet in the _Magha_.' Here there is no elision. But why not in अद्यपुष्यः, अद्यकृत्तिका. Because they do not denote location, which is understood. It is when location is expressed by such words that we may use the third case-affix in the alternative.",
    "23046": "Ex. उच्चैः 'aloft,' नीचैः 'below,' कुमारी 'virgin,' वृक्षः 'tree,' कूंडं 'owl,' द्रोणः 'a measure'. By 'number' grammatical number is meant; as एकः 'one,' द्वौ 'two,' बहवः 'many'.\n\nThe sense of a _Pratipadika_ is to denote mere existence. Genders are three, masculine, feminine and neuter. Measures are such as _drona_, _khari_, _adhaka_ &c. Numbers are singular, dual and plural. The _Nipatas_ which do not denote anything are also _Pratipadika_.",
    "23047": "Ex. हे राम '_O_ _Ram_' हे रामौ, हे रामाः ॥",
    "23048": "",
    "23049": "The vocative singular is called _sambuddhi_, when it is employed in the vocation. Thus (VI. 1. 69) declares 'after an inflectien base ending in एङ् or in a short vowel, a consonant is elided if it be that of '_Sambuddhi_' as हे राम ॥",
    "23050": "Ex. राज्ञः पुरुषः 'the king's man' पशोः पादः 'beast's foot' पितुः पुत्रः 'father's son.'",
    "23051": "Ex. मधुनो जानीते 'he engages in sacrifice with honey'. So also सर्पिषो जानीते. The verb ज्ञा when not meaning 'to know', has the significance of 'to act, or to engage in;' or it may denote 'false knowledge'; as सर्पिषि रक्तः प्रतिहतोवा. Compare (I. 3. 45).\n\nBut not so here स्वरेण पुत्रं जानाति 'he recognises the son by the voice.'",
    "23052": "Ex. मातुः अध्येति 'he remembers the mother,' सर्पिषो दयते 'he gives clarified butter,' नायं गात्राणामीष्टे 'he can not rule his limbs.' But not so here मातुर्गुणैः स्मरति because गुण here is not the object. The word शेष is also understood here. So that the cases not otherwise provided for, take this case. So that मातरं स्मरति is also allowed.",
    "23053": "Ex. एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते 'the wood gives a new quality to the water' (or he prepares the wood and water for sacrifice). (By (VI. 1. 139), स is inserted).\n\nWhen प्रतियत्न is not meant, the second case-affix is employed: as कटं करोति.\n\nThe word शेष is also understood here. So that we have also एधोदकमुपस्कुरुते ॥",
    "23054": "Ex. चौरस्य रुजति रोगः 'the disease afflicts the thief' चौरस्यामयति आमयः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the subject is an Abstract noun'? Observe नदी कूलानि रुजति 'the river breaks the banks.' So also not here चौरं ज्वरयति ज्वरः 'the fever burns the thief.' So also when the verb संताप is used, चौरं संतापयति तापः ।\n३\nThe word शेष is also understood here. Thus चौरं रुजति रोगः ॥",
    "23055": "Ex. मधुनो नाथते 'he blesses the honey.' But माणवकमुपनाथति, अंग पुत्रीकाधीष्व 'he solicits _manavaka_ saying (child) son, study.' Here नाथ does not mean to bless, and so it takes the accusative case.",
    "23056": "चौरस्य उज्जासयति, निप्रहन्ति, निहन्ति, प्रहन्ति, प्रणिहन्ति, उन्नाटयति, क्राथयति, पिनष्टि वा, 'he injures the thief.'\n\nThe root जसु belonging to the _Churadi_ class should be taken, and not _Divadi_. हन with the prepositions _pra_ and _ni_ may be taken in any order. The root क्रथ् takes in the causative _vriddhi_ irregularly. The verb is _Bhvadi_ and falls into the subdivision _ghatadi_, and is called there a मित् verb; all मित् verbs shorten their penultimate before the causative affix णिच् (VI. 4. 92). Thus क्राथ is an irregularity.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to injure'? Observe धानाः पिनष्टि 'he pounds the barley.'\n\nThe word शेष is also understood here as चौरमुज्जासयति. Only these govern the genitive, not so here चौरं हिनस्ति. चौरं विहन्ति ॥",
    "23057": "Ex. शतस्य व्यवहरति or पणते 'he deals in, or stakes hundred.'\n\nWhy does not the verb पण take the affix आय् ? It takes आय् when meaning 'to praise or honor,' and not in the sense of 'gambling, or bartering' &c. Not so here शलाकां व्यवहरति 'he throws the dice,' ब्राह्मणान् पणायते 'he praises the _Brahmanas_.' The word शेष is also here understood, so that we have शतं पणते 'he stakes a hundred.'",
    "23058": "Ex. शतस्य दीव्यति 'he stakes or deals in a hundred.' But not in ब्राह्मणं दीव्यति 'he jokes with the _Brahmana_.'\n\nThe _yoga_ _vibhaga_ when this root might well have been included in the last aphorism, is for the sake of the succeeding _sutras_, in which the _anuvritti_ of दिव runs, and not of others.",
    "23059": "Ex. शतस्य शतं वा प्रति दीव्यति 'he deals in or stakes a hundred.' But no option is allowed when the verb is simple as in the last aphorism; nor does this rule apply when the sense is not that of dealing or gambling. As, शलाकां प्रति दीव्यति 'he throws the missile.'",
    "23060": "Ex. गामस्य तदहः सभायां दीव्येयुः (_Maitr_.S.1.6.11) In the Vedic literature the simple verb _div_ takes the accusative instead of the genitive. And with _upasargas_ it is optional. The _anuvritti_ of the word शेष does not extend to this _sutra_, or the following.",
    "23061": "Ex. अग्नये छागस्य हविषोवपाया मेदसोऽनुब्रूहि प्रेष्य वा 'send to fire as oblation, the goat, the fat, and the marrow.' But not here –अग्नये छागं हविर्वपां मेदो जुहुधि. Because the verb is not _preshya_ or _bruhi_ So also not here अग्नये गोमयान् प्रेष्य. Because it is not an oblation. Not here too माणवकाय पुरोडाशं प्रेष्य. Because the recepient is not a diety. Compare (VIII. 2. 91).\n\nVart:- This rule does not apply when the word 'set out' qualifies the word हविः as; इन्द्राग्निभ्यां छागं हविर्वपां मेदः प्रस्थितं प्रेष्य 'send to _Indra_ and _Agni_ the oblation set out for them' &c.",
    "23062": "Ex. पुरुषमृगश्चन्द्रमसः or चन्द्रमसे 'to the moon, a male deer.' गोधा कालका दार्वा घाटस्ते वनस्पतीनाम् or वनस्पतिभ्यः, to you lords of the forest, are lizard, _kalaka_ bird, &c. So also वायुरस्मा उपा मन्थत् (_R_. _Ved_ X. 136. 7).\n\nWhy do we say 'diversely?' Observe कृष्णोरात्र्यै, हिमवती हस्ती.\n\nVart:- In the _Veda_, the 4th case-affix is employed in the sense of the sixth : as या खर्वेण पिबति तस्यै खर्वोजायते 'who soever woman drinks with a woman in her courses, gets herself in menstrua. So also या दतो धावति तस्यै श्यावदन् 'who cleans her teeth, her teeth become black.' या नखानि कृन्तति तस्यै कुनखः 'who pairs her nails, her nails become ugly.' So on, in याऽङ्क्तेतस्यै काणः याऽभ्यङ्क्तेतस्यै दुश्चर्मा, या केशान् प्रलिखति तस्यै खलति ॥ अहल्यायै जारः (T.S. 2.5.1.7.)",
    "23063": "Ex. घृतस्य or घृतेन यजते 'he sacrifices with butter.' सोमस्य or सोमेन यजते ॥",
    "23064": "Ex. पंचकृत्वोऽऽह्नोभुंक्ते 'he eats five times a day.' In short, 'words meaning so many times, or the numeral adverbs of frequency, govern the genitive of time in the sense of locative.' As द्विरह्नोऽधीते 'he studies twice in a day.'\n\nWhy do we say 'having the force of कृत्वसुच् ? Observe अह्नि शेते 'he sleeps in the day.'\n\nThis rule will not apply when the adverb of frequency is understood, not expressed (_prayoga_) as in अहनि भुक्तम्. Nor when the time is not meant, as द्विः कांस्यापात्र्यां भुंक्ते 'he eats in two brass vessels.' So also when location is not meant : as द्विरह्नो भुंक्ते. The शेष being understood we have द्विरहन्यधीते.",
    "23065": "Ex. क्रियां कालिदासस्य 'the composition of _Kalidasa_.' आहता क्रतूनां 'the performer of sacrifice.' So also भवतः शायिका 'your turn of lying down.' अपां स्रष्टा, पुरां भेत्ता वज्रस्य भर्त्ता. But not in शस्त्रेण भेत्ता 'cutting with weapon.'\n\nWhy do we say '_krit_?' Not so when a _Taddhita_-affix is employed as कृतपूर्वीकटं. In other words, the genitive in Sanskrit is both subjective and objective.",
    "23066": "आश्चर्य्यो गवां दोहोऽगोपालकेन 'the milking of a cow without a cowherd is a wonder.' रोचते मे ओदनस्य भोजनं देवदत्तेन. 'The eating of rice by _Devadatta_ pleases me;' पयसः पानं यज्ञदत्तेन 'the drinking of milk by _Yajnadatta_.'\n\nVart:- When the agent and object are both used, the agent is put in the instrumental, or genitive case, when, as some say, the _krit_ terminations are of the feminine gender, or as others say, when the terminations are of any gender; as, विचित्रा जगतः कृतिर्हरेर्हरिणा वा 'the creation of the world by _Hari_ is wonderful' शब्दानामनुशासनमाचार्य्येण आचार्यस्यवा 'the dissertation on words by the _acharya_' पवित्राहि सूत्रस्य कृतिः पाणिनेः  or पाणिनिना वा 'beautiful is the structure of _sutra_ by _Panini_.' _Apte_.",
    "23067": "Ex. राज्ञां पूजितः 'honored by kings,' अहमेवमतो महीपतेः 'I alone am regarded by the king.'\n\nWhy do we say 'क्त'? Observe ओदनं पचमानः 'rice is cooked.' Why do we say 'when denoting the present tense'?  Observe ग्रामं गतः 'gone to the village.'\n\nVart:- When used as abstract neuter nouns, past participles are used with the genitive, as मयूरस्य नृत्तं 'the dancing of a peacock' छात्रस्य हसितं 'the laughing of the student'. कोकिलस्य व्याहूतम् 'the screaming of the cuckoo.' When, however, agent is desired to be particularised, the instrumental case is employed : as छात्रेण हसितम्.\n\nThis _sutra_ debars _sutra_ (II. 3. 69) by which genitive is prohibited after _Nishtha_ affixes. This is an exception to that _sutra_.",
    "23068": "This also is an exception to the prohibition about _Nishtha_ contained in (II. 3. 69). As इदमेषामासितम् 'this is their seat.' इदमेषां शयितं 'this is their sleeping.'\n\nIn connection with verbs taking two objects, both take the genitive case, when a word ending in _krit_-affix denotes the agent, as they would have taken the accusative : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामस्य चैत्रः '_Chaitra_ is the leader of the horse of the village.' When, however, one is the principal, then the object takes the genitive : as, नेताऽश्वस्य ग्रामं चैत्रः, '_Chaitra_ leads the horse to the village.'",
    "23069": "After these words, the Instrumental case must be employed to denote the Agent, and the Accusative case to denote the object. This _sutra_ debars Genitive which would have come by (II. 3. 65). The word लोक is formed by ल + उ + उक = ल + ऊक = लोक.\n\n1. The word ल means the substitutes of ल i.e., the Present Participles in शतृ, शानच् (III. 2. 124), कानच् (III. 2. 106) क्वसु (III. 2. 107) कि and किन् (III. 2. 172). Thus ओदनं पचन्, पचमानः, पेचानः or पेचिवान्, पपिः सोमम्, ददिर्गाः ॥\n\n2. The affix उ is enjoined by (III. 2. 168), as, कटं चिकीर्षुः, ओदनं बुभुक्षुः ॥ The prohibition applies when a word ending in इष्णुच् (III. 2. 136) is the governing term, as, कन्यामलंकरिष्णुः ॥\n\n3. The affix उक is ordained by (III. 2. 154): as आगामुकं वाराणसीं रक्ष आहुः ॥\n\nVart:- But the word कामुक in the classical Sanskrit, governs the Genitive, as दास्याः कामुकः 'lusting for the slave.'\n\n4. Indeclinables formed by कृत् affixes, as, कटं कृत्वा, ओदनं भुक्त्वा ॥  \n\nVart:- This prohibition, however, does not apply to the indeclinables formed by तोसुन् (III 4.16) and कसुन् (III. 4. 17), as, पुरा सूर्यस्योदेतोराधेयः पुरा क्रूरस्य विसृपो विरप्शिन् (1. 1. 40).\n\n5. _Nishtha_ i.e., क्त and क्तवतु; as ओदनं भुक्तवान् देवदत्तेन कृतम्.\n\n6. The words formed by खलर्थ affixes (III. 3. 126), as, ईषत्करो भवता कटः, ईषत्पानः सोमो भवता.\n\n7. The तृन् in the aphorism is a _pratyahara_, formed by taking the तृ of  शतृ (III. 2. 129) and the final न् of तृन् (III. 2. 135), meaning the affixes जानन् (III. 2. 128), चानश (III. 2. 129), शतृ (III. 2. 130) and तृन् (III. 2. 135). As सोमं पवमानः, नटमाघ्नानः, अधीयन्, पारायणम्, कर्ता कटान्, वदिता जनापवादान् ।\n\nVart:- Optionally so, when the root द्विष् takes the affix शतृ, as, चौरं or चौरस्य द्विषन् ॥",
    "23070": "The affix अक, such as ण्वुल, वुञ् &c., denote futurity, and never denote indebtedness. The affix इन् such as णिनि (III. 3. 3) and (III. 3. 170) denotes both. Thus कटं कारको व्रजति 'he goes to make a mat.' ओदनं भोजको व्रजति 'he goes to eat rice.' So also with इन्, as ग्रामंगमी or ग्रामी 'he has to go to the village.' शतं दायी 'he owes hundred.'\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting futurity or indebtedness' ? Observe यवानां लावकः 'the cutter of barley.' सक्तूनां पावकः, अवश्यं करी कटस्य ॥\n\nWhy is the Genitive employed in the following वर्षशतस्य पूरकः, पुत्रपौत्राणां दर्शकः ? The words पूरक and दर्शक, though formed by अक (III. 1. 133), are not formed by that अक which denotes futurity, viz., (II . 3. 10). The present _sutra_ relates to this latter अक, and not every अक in general.",
    "23071": "By (II. 3. 65), verbal nouns, (_krit_-formed), always govern the Genitive in denoting agent or object. The present _sutra_ declares an option as to agent only, in the case of those verbal nouns which are Future Passive Participles. Thus भवतः or भवता कटः कर्तव्यः (III.1.95).\n\nWhy do we say 'in denoting the agent'? In denoting the object, no option is allowed; the Genitive is compulsory. As गेयो माणवकः साम्नाम् ॥\n\nVart:- The prohibition of the Genitive should be stated in the case of the Future Passive Participles of those verbs which govern two objects. Thus क्रष्टव्या ग्रामं शाखा देवदत्तेन, नेतव्या ग्राममजा देवदत्तेन ॥",
    "23072": "Thus तुल्यो देवदत्तेन or देवदत्तस्य, सदृशो देवदत्तेन, or देवदत्तस्य  ॥ But with तुला and उपमा the Genitive must necessarily be employed. As तुला देवदत्तस्य नास्ति, उपमा कृष्णस्य न विद्यते ॥\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of वा was understood in this _sutra_ from the previous _sutra_, yet the repetition of अन्यतरस्याम् is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_. The word च in (II. 3. 73) attracts the word अन्यतरस्याम् into that _sutra_; but had the word अन्यतरस्याम् not been used in this _sutra_, then the word च would have attracted the word तृतीया instead, which is not desired.\n\nOn this _sutra_, Professor _Apte_ says:-- '_Panini_ says that the words तुला and उपमा can not be used with the Instrumental. But this is against good usage : as तुलां, यदारोहति दंतवाससा (_Kum_. _Sam_. V. 24), नभसा तुलां समाररोह (_Raghuvamsa_ VIII. 15). स्फुठोपमं भूतिसितेन शंभुना (_Magh_ I. 4).'",
    "23073": "The च in the _sutra_ makes the employment of Dative optional : in the alternative we have Genitive.\n\nVart:- In this _sutra_ आयुष्य &c., include their synonyms also.\n\nThus आयुष्यं देवदत्ताय भूयात् or आयुष्यं देवदत्तस्य भूयात् ॥ Similarly चिरं जीवितं, मद्रं, भद्रं, कुशलं, निरामयं, सुखं, शं, अर्थो, प्रयोजनं, हितं पथ्यं देवदत्ताय or देवदत्तस्य भूयात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say when 'benediction is intended'? Observe आयुष्यं देवदत्तस्य तपः 'the austerity is the cause of the long life of _Devadatta_.' Here there is no option allowed : and the Genitive case is only employed.",
    "24001": "The word एकवचन is a genitive _Tat_-_purusha_ compound meaning 'the expression for one,' that is to say, it expresses the sense of unity. The rule therefore, enjoins that the sense inherent in a _Dvigu_ compound is that of unity.\n\nThis is confined to _Samahara_ _Dvigu_ i.e., an aggregate compound taken in a collective sense. As, पञ्चगवं 'an aggregate of five cows', पञ्चपली (IV.1. 21.). The sense of _Dvigu_ being that of one, it follows that it retains the singular number even when further modified by other affixes, and used as an attributive and though no longer a _Dvigu_, as, पञ्चपूलीयं शोभना ॥",
    "24002": "As, पाणिपादम्, 'the hand and foot' शिरोग्रीवं 'the head and neck' मार्दङ्गिकपाणविकम् 'players on the _mridanga_ and _panava_ (kinds of drums)' रथिकाश्वरोहम् 'the soldiers on chariot and horse.' वीणावादकपरिवादकस्, रथिकपादातम् ॥\n\nThis rule applies to cases of _Samahara_ _Dvandva_ or aggregate _Dvandva_ Compounds only; and not to _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_ (II. 2. 29.)\n\nIn the _Dvandva_ Compounds of animals such as elephants, horses, &c., the singular is optional; (II. 4. 12.) The present rule also gives us an index as to where we must make _Samahara_ _Dvandva_ and where an _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_. The _Dvandva_ compounds of words signifying members of animal body, players or army, are always and solely _Samahara_ _Dvandva_. The compounds of words like दधिपयसी 'curd and milk' (II. 4. 14.) are purely _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_ and can never be _Samahara_ _Dvandva_; while compounds of words denoting tree, animals &c., (II. 4. 12.) are optionally either _Samahara_ or _Itaretara_ _Dvandva_.",
    "24003": "The word चरण means a school or branch of any of the Vedas designated by the name of the person who founded such a branch and hence means such a person. The word अनुवाद means repetition by way of explanation, illustration or corroboration; that is to say, when a speaker demonstrates for some special purposes, a proposition which had already been demonstrated before, that is called _anuvada_.\n\nThis aggregate is used with the aorist of the roots स्था and इङ् only; as उदगात् कठकालापम् '_katha_ and _kalapa_ arose (again, further demonstrating their doctrines)'; प्रत्यष्ठात् कठकौथुमम् '_katha_ and _kauthuma_ established again.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning repetition'? Observe उदगुः कठकालापाः or प्रत्यष्ठुः कठकौथुमाः, when demonstration for the first time is meant. is the aorist of स्था and इन् which takes such a _Dvandva_ and not any other verb or any other tense of these verbs; as:- अनन्दिषुः कठकालापाः and उदयन्ति कठकालापाः\n\nNote :- This _sutra_ is translated thus by Mr. _Iyangar_, 'Aggregation alone is admissible between words denoting persons belonging to the different _charanas_ of the Vedas, when they are used along with the aorist derived from the roots _stha_ and _in_ in the sense of recitation of the _charanas_ as already learnt, as distinguished from learning them the first time.' Prof. Bohthlingk's translation is, 'The _Dvandva_ Compound of the names of Vedic-Schools is singular, when such a school is repeatedly mentioned equally along with another.'",
    "24004": "As, अर्काश्वमेधम् the _Arks_ and _Asvamedha_ sacrifices,' सायाह्नातिरात्रम् 'the _Sayahna_ and _Atiratra_ sacrifices.\n\nWhy do we say '_Yajur_-_veda_ sacrifices' ? Observe इषुवज्रौ 'the _lshu_ and _Vajra_ ceremonies,' उद्भिद्वलभिदौ ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when not in the neuter gender' ? Observe राजसूयवाजपेयौ 'the _Rajasuya_ and _Vajapeya_ sacrifices.'\n\nWhy have we दर्शपौर्णमासौ ? Because the word क्रतुः is a technical term applying only to _Soma_-sacrifices and not any sacrifices in general. Therefore, though _Darsa_ and _Paurnamasa_ are _Yajur_-_veda_ ceremonies, they not being _Soma_ ceremonies, the present rule, does not apply.",
    "24005": "As, पदकक्रमकम् 'a person who has studied the _pada_ arrangement and a person who has studied the _krama_ arrangement; so also क्रमकवार्त्तिकम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'order of study'? Observe पितापुत्रौ 'father and son.' Why do we say 'not remote'? See याज्ञिकवैयाकरणौ 'sacrifice-knower and the grammarian.'",
    "24006": "Thus आराशस्त्रि 'the probe and the knife'; धानाशष्कुलि 'fried rice and barley cake.'\n\nWhy do we say 'words denoting genus'? Observe नन्दकपाञ्चजन्यौ '_Nandaka_ and _Panchajanya_.'\n\nWhy do we say 'not of living'? See ब्रह्मणक्षत्रियौ '_Brahmanas_ and the _Kshatriyas_.'\n\nThis rule applies to the _jati_ or genus names of substances (द्रव्यजाति) and not the _jati_ names of qualities and actions. (गुणक्रियाजाति), Thus रूपरसगन्धस्पर्शाः 'colour, savour, odour, and tangibility'; गमनाकुञ्चनप्रसारणानि 'going, contraction and expansion.'\n\nEven with _jati_ names of substances, the _Dvandva_ compound takes singular, only when the objects are spoken of collectively as a class; when, however, the individuals belonging to a class are indicated, the proper number should be employed; as, इह कुण्डे बदरामलकानि तिष्ठन्ति 'in this bowl are the _badari_ and _amalaki_ fruits.'\n\nThe words जाति 'genus,' द्रव्य 'substance,' गुण 'quality' and क्रिया 'action' are technical terms of Indian Logicians. _jati_ has already been explained. Substances are nine : earth, water, light, air, ether, time, space, soul, and mind. Qualities are twenty-four: colour, savour, odour tangibility, number, dimension, severalty, conjunction, disjunction, priority, posteriority, weight, fluidity, viscidity, sound, understanding, pleasure, pain, desire, aversion, effort, merit, demerit and faculty. There are five actions: throwing upwards, throwing downwards, contraction, expansion, and going.",
    "24007": "Thus गंगाशोणम् 'the Ganges and the _Sona_. कुरवः + कुरुक्षेत्रं = कुरुकुरुक्षेत्रं 'the country of the _Kurus_ and the _Kurukshetra_.' उद्ध्यैरावती कुरुकुरु जाङ्गलम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of different genders'? Observe गंगायमुने 'the _Gangas_ or and the _Yamuna_.' Both being feminine gender, so also मद्रकेकयाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'rivers and countries'? Observe कुक्कुटमयुर्यौ 'the hen and the pea-hen.'\n\nWhy do we say 'not of a town'? See जाम्बबशालूकिन्यौ '_Jambaba_ and _Salukini_, which are the names of two villages or _grama_.\n\nWe have taken the word 'river,' as the word 'country' does not include 'river.' So also 'mountains' are not included; as कैलासगन्धमादने 'the _Kailasa_ and the _Gandbamadana_.'\n\nVart:- The prohibition extends to villages and towns (_grama_) but not to cities, (_Nagara_), as मथुरापाटलिपुत्रं 'the cities of _Mathura_ and _Pataliputra_.'\n\nVart:- When a compound consists of two words, one a town and the other a city, the prohibition applies; as सौर्यकेतवते 'the city of _Saurya_ and the village of _Ketavata_.'",
    "24008": "Thus यूकालिक्षम् 'the louse and the nil'; दंशमशकम् 'the bug and the mosquito.' The word क्षुद्रजन्तु means an animal of a very small size. Some say that animals not having bones are called क्षुद्रजन्तु, (invertebrates); others say, those which are small in size; others say, all below the mongoose are _kshudrajantu_.",
    "24009": "The word विरोध means enmity: and शाश्वतिकः means permanent.\n\nThus, मार्जारमूषकम् 'the cat and the rat'; श्वशृगालम् 'the dog and the jackal'; अहिनकुलं 'the snake and the mongoose.'\n\nWhy do we say 'natural and eternal'? Observe गौपालिशालंकायनाः कलहायन्ते '_Gaupali_ and _Salankayana_ are quarrelling.'\n\nThe force of the word च in the aphorism is that of एव 'only.' _Dvandva_ compounds of such animals only are invariably singular; no other rule, even if otherwise applicable, would apply to such compounds. Thus rule (I. 4. 12) says that _Dvandva_ compounds of beasts and birds, is optionally singular. That rule (by (I. 4. 2.)) would have set aside the present rule. But च prevents that, and no optional plural number is allowed in case of beasts or birds that are naturally at war; as अश्वमहिषम् 'the horse and the buffalo'; काकोलूकम् 'the crow and the owl.'",
    "24010": "Thus, तक्षायस्करम् 'the carpenter and the blacksmith'; रजकतन्तुवायम् 'the washerman and the weaver.'\n\nThe word अनिर्वासित means one not expelled (from the dish).\n\nA _Sudra_ who can take food from the dish of a higher class, without permanently defiling that vessel, is called an _Anirvasita_ _Sudra_.\n\nWhy do we say 'not expelled'? Observe चण्डालमृतपाः 'the _Chandala_ and the _Mritapa_.'",

    "24019": "This is a governing _sutra_ and regulates the sense of the succeeding aphorisms which show when a _Tat_-_purusha_ may be neuter.

So also if the town is not in the country of the _Usinaras_, as दाक्षिकन्था.\n\nThis debars the rule (II. 4. 25.) by which a compound gets the gender of its subsequent term. (For accent see (IV. 2. 124.))",

So also the sense may be that of invention &c., but when these words are not employed, the neuter gender is not used; as वाल्मीकिश्लोकाः 'the _slokas_ invented by _Valmiki_.' N. P.

    "24023": "As इनसभम् 'the King's Court.' ईश्वरसभम् 'Lord's Court.'\n\nBut in राजसभा 'the King's Court,' the word is not neuter; for synonyms of राजा are only to be taken and not the word-form राजा; an apparent exception to Rule (I. 1. 68).\n\nSo also रक्षःसभम् 'the Court of the _Rakshasas_' पिशाचसभम् 'the Court of the _Pisachas_.'\n\nBut in काष्ठसभा, दैवदत्तसभा &c, the word is not neuter; for the word non-human has a technical significance meaning _Rakshasa_ or a monster.",

The _Samahara_ _Dvandva_ is always neuter. So also in _Tat_-_purusha_ compound not especially mentioned in the previous aphorism : As अर्द्धपिप्पल्याः, अर्द्धपिप्पली 'half a _pippali.' अर्द्धकोशतकी.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be made in regard to (1) _Dvigu_ compound, (2) compounds with प्राप्त, आपन्न and, अलं, and (3) compounds with _Gati_ words; as, पंचकपालः '_Purodasa_ prepared in five cups'; प्राप्तजीविकः (प्राप्त + जीविका) 'has obtained living,' आपन्नजीविकः, अलंजीविकः, निष्कौशाम्बिः 'gone beyond _Kausambi_.'",
    "24027": "This applies where the compound is not an aggregate by rule (II. 4. 12); in that case it will be neuter, अश्ववडवाविमौ; अश्ववडवान्, अश्ववडवैः &c., (in every number and case) 'those two (mas.) the horse and the mare.'

In the Vedas the ordinary rules of gender are often set aside; this an individual example of the universally exceptional nature of the Vedic language.",
    "24029": "These words refer to _krit_ and _Samasanta_ affixes. Thus the word रात्र is formed by रात्रि + अच् (V. 4. 87) अह्न is formed by (V. 4. 88) and अह by (V. 4. 91).

    "24032": "The word अन्वादेश means literally saying (_adesa_) 'after' (_anu_) or after-say or re-employment.\n\nअश् (actually अ) replaces इदम् in all cases except the nominative and the accusative, when _anvadesa_ or repetition is implied. अश् replaces the whole of इदम् by 55 and not only the final म्. _Anvadesa_ means repeating in a second sentence with reference to the preceding in which it has already been used. Both pronouns, the antecedent and the subsequent, must refer to the same object. As, आभ्याम् छात्राभ्याम् रात्रिरधीता, अथो आभ्यामहरप्यधीम् 'Those students studied in the night and they have read in the day also.' The substitute अश् will replace इदम्, even when the latter takes the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71.)\n\nअस्मै छात्राय कम्बलं देहि, अथो अस्मै शाकटमपि देहि 'Give this student a blanket and give him also a cloth'. अस्य छात्रस्य शोभनं शीलम्, अथो अस्य प्रभूतं स्वम्, 'this student's conduct is excellent, and his wealth is great.'\n\nSo also when the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71) comes after the Pronominal as इमकाभ्यां छात्राभ्यां रात्रिरधीता, अथो आभ्यामहरप्यधीतम्.\n\nThe mere mentioning in a subsequent sentences is now _anvadesa_ : it is the employment again of what has been employed to direct one operation, to direct another operation. Therefore the rule does not apply here :- देवदत्तं भोजय, इमंच यज्ञदत्तम्  'feed _Devadatta_ and this _Yajnadatta_.'",
    "24033": "Thus अत्र 'here,' and अतस् 'hence' in the following :- एतस्मिन् ग्रामे सुखं वसामः ; अथो अत्र युक्ता अधीमहे । 'We live in this (_etasmin_) village, happily, therefore let us read with full devotion in this (_atra_).' एतस्माच्छात्राच्छन्दोऽधीष्व, अथो अतो व्याकरणमप्यधीष्व । 'Learn from this student Prosody and also learn from him Grammar.' By rule (V. 3. 5.) अश् is declared to be the substitute of एतद्; its repetition here is to indicate that this अश् of _anvadesa_ is _anudatta_.",
    "24034": "The word इदम् is also understood in this _sutra_ though it was not so in the last. This skipping is technically called 'frog-leap.' Thus:- इमं or एतं छात्रं छन्दोऽध्यापय, अथो एमं व्याकरणमप्यध्यापय 'teach this pupil Prosody, and teach him Grammar also,' अनेन or एतेन छात्रेण रात्रिरधीता 'अथो एनेनाहरप्यधीतम् 'this pupil studied in the night and he studied in the day also'. अनयोः or एतयोः छात्रयोः शोभनं शीलम्, अथो एनयोः प्रभूतं स्वं 'the family of these two students is respectable and their wealth is great.'\n\nVart:- The word एनत् neuter and singular, is also used in _anvadesa_: as, इदम् कुण्डमानय प्रक्षालयैनत् 'bring this bowl and wash it.' The above three _Sutra_ regulate the accent only of certain pronouns.",
    "24035": "Thus it will be taught in _sutra_ (2. 4. 42),' that वध् is the substitute of हन् when लिङ् follows.' The words 'when the affix is _ardhadhatuka_' must be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense. The result will be that in the _ardhadhatuka_ लिङ् namely the आशीर्लिङ् or the Benedictive mood, हन् is replaced by वध्, but not so in the _Sarvadhatuka_ लिङ् i. e., the Potential mood (विधिलिङ्). Thus, Benedictive वध्यात् 'may he kill'; but Potential हन्यात् 'let him kill.'\n\nThe word आर्द्धधातुके is in the 7th case; the force of this case-affix here is not that given in (l. 1. 66). i. e., the _sutra_ does not mean 'when an _ardhadhatuka_ affix follows.' But the 7th case has the force of indicating the subject, the meaning of the _sutra_ being 'when the subject is an _ardhadhatuka_ affix.' The result of this explanation is, that the various substitutions enjoined hereafter should be made first, and then the respective affixes should be applied. Thus whenever we want to affix any _ardhadhatuka_-affix to अस् 'to be,' we must first substitute भू for it, and then take the proper _ardhadhatuka_-affix which would come with regard to भू. Thus we can apply यत to भू by rule (III. 1. 97) which says: 'after verbs ending in vowels यत is applied.' But this affix could never have been applied to अस् which ends in a consonant. Thus we have भव्यम्. So the substitution does not depend upon any particular affix, but _ardhadhatuka_-affixes as a class.",
    "24036": "प्रजग्ध्य 'Having eaten.' (प्र + अद् + ल्यप् = प्र + जग्ध् + य). So also जग्ध 'eaten' (अद्  + क्त =जग्ध् + त).\n\nThe इ in जग्धि is merely for the sake of articulation and is not an _anubandha_, otherwise there would have been the insertion of the nasal न (नुम्). So also the इ in वचि &c, is merely for the sake of articulation. But अद् + क्त = अन्नः 'food' is an irregularity.\n\nThe employment of ल्यप् in this _sutra_ indicates the existence of this _Paribhasha_. 'A _bahiranga_ substitution of ल्यप् supersedes even _antaranga_ rules.' Because in case this maxim did not exist, the substitution of जग्ध् for अद् before ल्यप् which is taught in this _sutra_, would follow already from the word किति (before that which is distinguished by an indicatory क) in this rule, i. e., जग्ध् would (by maxim 'that which is _bahiranga_ is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is _antaranga_ has taken effect') first be substituted for अद् before क्त and ल्यप् afterwards for क्त.\n\nWhy do we say 'before affixes beginning with त'? Observe अद्यते 'is eaten.'\n\nWhy do we say 'before affixes having indicatory क'? Observe अत्तव्यम्.",
    "24037": "अघसत्, अघसताम्, अघसन् 'he ate.' The लृ in घस्लृ is servile and indicates the substitution of अङ् for च्वि of the Aorist (III. 1. 55.) So also in desiderative, as, जिघत्सति, जिघत्सतः जिघत्सन्ति 'wishes to eat.'\n\nVart:- The verb अद् is replaced by घस् when the affix अच् follows Thus प्र + अद् + अच् = घस् + अच् = प्रघसः 'voracious.'",
    "24038": "घासः 'food, grass,' अद् + घञ् = घास + अ (III. 3. 19). प्रघसः 'voracity.' प्र + अद् + अप् = प्र + घस.",

Sometimes it does not take place; as आतामद्य मध्यतो भेद उद्भृतम्\n\nThe word बहुलं is used in this _sutra_ and the word अन्यतरस्याम् in the next. There is evidently difference between the senses of these words; otherwise _Panini_ would not have employed them in such juxtaposition, had they been synonymous. For then the anuvritti of बहुलं in the next _sutra_ would have been sufficient. The following verse indicates that difference.\n\nक्वचित् प्रवृत्तिः क्वचिदप्रवृत्तिः, क्वचिदविभाषा क्वचिदन्यदेव ।\nविधेर्विधानं बहुधा समीक्ष्य, चातुर्विध बाहुलकं वदन्ति ॥\n\n'Sometimes they are, where there is no express rule for their application; sometimes they are not applied, in spite of an express rule for their application; sometimes they are optionally employed or not, and sometimes there is some other result, licence permitted by the rule.' Thus in घस्ताम् there is not elision of the penultimate.",
    "24040": "अघास or आद 'he ate,' जक्षतुः आदतुः 'they two ate,' जक्षुः or आदुः 'they all ate' The word जक्षतुः is thus formed :- घस् + अतुस् = घस् + अस् + अतुस् (VI. 1. 8) = घ + घस् +अतुस् (VII. 4. 60) = च + घस् + अतुः (VII. 4. 62) = ज + घस् + अतुस् (VIII. 4. 53) = ज + घ्स् + अतुस् (VI. 4. 98.) = जक्षतुः (VIII. 3. 60).",
    "24041": "In the Perfect tense thus we have two roots: Let us first take वेञ्. Then we have regulary वे + लिट् = वे + णल् = ववौ. The roots in ए, ऐ and ओ are treated like roots ending in आ thus :-\n\n- 3rd person - ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः\n- 2nd person - वविथ or ववाथ, ववथुः, वव\n- 1st person - ववौ, वविव, वविम  \n\nIn this case _samprasarana_ ordained by (VI. 1. 17) does not take place by (VI. 1.40)\n\nWhen however we take the base वय्, th इ being for the sake of articulation only, we have the following forms:- वय् + णल् = वय् + वय् + अ (VI. 1. 8) = उय् + वय् + अ (VI. 1. 17) = उवाय; the य is not changed into इ by (VI. 1. 38). In this dual we have वय् + अतुस् = उय् + अतुः (VI.1.15) = उ + उय् + अतुः (VII. 4. 60) = ऊयतुः The affix अतुस् being कित् affix by rule (I. 2. 5) there is _samprasarana_ before reduplication. Thus we have उयाय, ऊयतुः, ऊयुः. Further by rule (VI. 1. 39) before कित् affixes व may be optionally substituted for य, i. e., ऊयतुः or ऊवतुः and ऊयुः or ऊवुः",
    "24042": "वध्यात् 'may he kill,' वध्यास्ताम् 'may they two kill,' वध्यासुः 'may they all kill.'\n\nThe substitute वध्, ends with short अ this अ is elided. This elision being like the original (_sthanivat_ (I. 1. 56)), in forming the Aorist, लुङ्, we have अवध् + ० + ईत् = अवधीत्. Here zero being _sthanivat_ prevents the _vriddhi_ of अ of व which otherwise would have take place by (VII. 2. 7).",
    "24043": "अवधीत् 'he killed,' अवधीष्टाम् 'they two killed.' The division of this aphorism from the last _sutra_ (_yoga_-_vibhaga_) indicates that the next rule applies to Aorist only and not to Benedictive as well. There is no option in Benedictive _Atmanepada_.",
    "24044": "Thus आवधिष्ट or आहत; आवधिषाताम् or आहसाताम्; आवधिशत or आहसत.\n\nThe verb हन् becomes _Atmanepadi_ when preceded by आ (I. 3. 28) By _sutra_ (I. 1.14), the Aorist-affixes in the _Atmanepada_ are कित् and हन् and by (VI. 4. 37) the न is elided before कित् affixes then by (VIII. 2. 27) the स is elided. Thus आहन् + सिच् + त = आहत.",
    "24045": "अगात् 'he went' (II. 4. 77) अगाताम् 'they two went' जगुः 'they all went.' The repetition of the words लुङ् in this _sutra_ though is _anuvritti_ was coming from the last aphorisms, indicates that there is no option allowed even in the _Atmanepada_, गा being the invariable substitute in all the _Padas_. Thus अगायि भवता 'you, went.' The form अगात् is thus evolved आ + गा + सिच् + त् =, जगात् (II. 4. 77.)\n\nVart:- गा is the substitute of इक् 'to remember' in the Aorist as it is of इण्. Thus अध्यगात् 'he remembered.' अध्यागाताम्, अध्यगुः. The root इक् belongs to _Adadi_ class.",
    "24046": "गमयति 'makes him go' गमयतः, गमयन्ति &c. But प्रत्याययति 'causes to believe.' अधिगामयति. The इ of गमि is for articulation. So also इक् to 'remember'; as, अधिगमयति ॥",
    "24047": "जिगमिषति 'wishes to go' जिगमिषतः, जिगमिषन्ति. But अर्थान् प्रतीषिषति 'he wishes to inform the meaning.' So also with इक्, as अधिजिगमिषति. The _yogavibhaga_ indicates that the _anuvritti_ of सन् only runs in the next _sutra_ and not of णि. The form is thus evolved in the _Parasmaipada_; सन् + गम् = गम् + गम् + स (VI. 1. 9) = ग + गम् + स (VII. 4. 60) = ज + गम् + स (VII. 4. 62) = ज + गम् + इट् + स (VII. 2. 50) = जिगमिष, and then we add the personal terminations.",
    "24048": "अधिजिगांसते, ०सेते, ०सन्ते 'he wishes to study.' The root इङ् is always preceded by the preposition अधि. This will be _Atmanepadi_ by (1. 3. 12) and (I. I. 56). The form is similarly evolved by the application of rules (VII. 2. 58.) and (VI. 4. 16).",
    "24049": "The substitute being like its original (I. 1. 68.) गाङ् would have been _Atmanepadi_, even without the indicatory, ङ्. Why has then this ङ् been added to it? The object is that in the _sutra_ (1. 2. 1.) गाङ् there should mean this substitute गाङ् and not the verb 'to go.'\n\nThus we get अधिजगे 'he studied'. अधिजगाते, अधिजगिरे. See (VI. 4. 64) and (III. 4. 8).",
    "24050": "Let us take the case when गाङ् replaces इङ्. The affixes of लुङ् and लृङ् are treated as ङित् by (I. 2. 1). and then by the Rule (VI. 4. 66) (When an _ardhadhatuka_ affix, beginning with a consonant and distinguished by an indicatory क or ङ् follows; then let ई be the substitute of long आ of the verbs termed घु and of मा, स्था, गा पा, हा, सी), we get अध्यगीष्ट (अधि + अ + गी + स्त), अध्यगीषाताम्, अध्यगीषत. In the alternative we have अध्यैष्ट, अध्यैषाताम् and अध्यैषत.\n\nSo also in लृङ्; as अध्यगीष्यत, अध्यगीष्येताम्, अध्यगीष्यन्त, or in the alternative, अध्यैष्यत,आध्यैष्येताम् and अध्यैष्यन्त.",
    "24051": "अधिजिगापयिषति or अध्यापिपयिषति 'he desires to teach.' The form is thus evolved : गा + णिच् = गापि (VII. 3. 36); then by the rules already stated, we get the above form with the affix सम्. अध्यजीगपत् or अध्यापिपत् 'he taught.' The ई is changed into आ by (VI. 1. 48). Thus इ + णिच् = आ + णिच् = आ + प् + इ = आपि. This rule applies to the desideratives of causatives and aorist of causatives.",
    "24052": "भविता 'he will be,' भवितुम् 'in order to be' भवितव्यम् 'must be.' Now the Perfect tense affixes are also _ardhadhatuka_ affixes (III. 4. 115). The Perfect of अस् is therefore the same as that of भू, namely, बभूव &c. There is, however, an important exception to this rule, namely, when अस् is employed as an auxiliary verb in forming Periphrastic Perfect of other verbs. In that case अस् forms its Perfect tense regularly, आस आसतुः आसुः &c. This apparent breach of the present _sutra_ is explained by taking the term कृञ् in (III. 1. 40) as a _Pratyahara_ including कृ, भू and अस्, and if अस् could not form its Perfect in the regular way, its inclusion in this _Pratyahara_ would be useless; hence we conclude, that as an auxiliary verb, अस् forms its Perfect regularly.",
    "24053": "वक्ता 'he will speak,' वक्तुम् 'in order to speak.' The इ of वचि is for the sake of articulation only. The substitute being like the principal, वच् is _Atmanepadi_ when the fruit of the action accrues to the agent, as ऊचे 'he spoke,' वक्ष्यते 'he will speak.'",
    "24054": "आख्याता 'he will perceive or tell'; अख्यातुम् 'in order to tell;' अख्यातव्यम् 'must be told.' The substitute being like the principal, चक्षिङ् being always _Atmanepadi_ (I. 3. 12), ख्याञ् would have also been always _Atmanepadi_. But in that case the letter ञ् would have no scope; it therefore follows that ख्याञ् is not always _Atmanepadi_, but under conditions mentioned in (I. 3. 72).\n\nVart:- This substitute is also said to begin with क्श instead of ख्य. Thus अक्शाता, आक्शातुम्, आक्शातव्यं.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when meaning 'exclusion'; as दुर्जनाः संचक्ष्याः 'bad men should be excluded.'\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when the affixes अस and अन follow : as नृचक्षा राक्षसः 'the _Rakshasas_ are cruel.' This is Vedic Sanskrit; modern नृचक्षः. The meaning of the root चक्ष् here, is 'to injure.' So also निचक्षणः पण्डितः; here the affix is अन.\n\nVart:- Substitutes are made diversely in denoting appellatives and not qualities and in the Vedic Sanskrit; as अन्नम् 'food' (here the substitute जग्धि does not replace अद); वधकम् 'killer' (वध being substituted for हन् before ण्वुल्); गात्रं 'body' (गा is substituted for इण before the _unadi_ affix ष्टन्); विचक्षणः (here चक्ष is not replaced by ख्या before अन); अजिरम् 'a court yard' (here अज is not replaced by व्यै as the next _sutra_ 56 requires.)",
    "24055": "The लिट् also is an _ardhadhatuka_ affix and by the last _sutra_ ख्या would always have been the substitute of चक्ष्; the present _sutra_ makes this substitution optional, as आचख्यौ, आचख्यतुः and आचख्युः. In the alterative we have आचचक्षे, आचचक्षाते and आचचक्षिरे 'he told &c.'",
    "24056": "प्रवायकः 'driver,' प्रवायणीयः.\n\nWhy do we say 'with the exception of घञ् and अप्'? Observe सम् + अज + घञ् = समाजः 'society'; उदाजः 'driving out.' So also with अप्, as समजः 'a multitude or herd of animals &c., उदजः 'driving out of cattle.' See (III. 3. 69).\n\nWhy have we used वी with a long ई? For the sake of forms like प्रवीताः &c.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must also be stated (along with घञ् and अप्) of the affix क्यप्, as समज्या 'a meeting, fame.'\n\nVart:- The substitution is optional before _ardhadhatukas_ beginning with a letter of वल् _Pratyahara_ (all consonant except य) as प्रवेता or प्राजिता प्रवेतुम् or प्राजितुम्. See (VI. 2. 144) for accent.",
    "24057": "This declares an option in case of the affix ल्युट्, the word यु in the _Sutra_ referring to this affix; as, प्रवयणः or प्राजनो दण्डः 'driving stick or whip.'",
    "24058": "1. Thus by _sutra_ (IV. 1. 151) (the affix ण्य comes after कुरु &c., in denoting descendent) we get कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः (VII. 2. 117) 'a grandson of _Kuru_.' This is a _Gotra_ word (IV. 1. 162). Now in forming a word denoting a lower descendent than grandson, we add a _Yuvan_ affix. Thus कौरव्य + इञ् (IV. 1. 95). Now this इञ् is elided by the present _sutra_, and we get the form कौरव्यः which thus means both a _Gotra_ and a _Yuvan_ (IV. 1. 163) descendent of _Kuru_. So that कौरव्यः is the name both of the father and the son.\n\nNow it may be objected : 'the word कौरव्यः belongs to the तिकादि class and by (IV. 1. 154), it will take the affix फिञ्. Do we, what we may, the form will be कौरव्यायणिः (VII. 1. 2.') To this we reply, the word कौरव्यः which we see in that list of तिक् &c., is not the word कौरव्यः which we formed by adding ण्य under rule (IV. 1. 151); that _Tikadi_ word is formed by adding ण्य under rule (IV. 1. 172), and is confined to _Kshatriya_. The कौरव्यः which we have taken, denotes a _Brahmin_ _Gotra_ formed by (IV.1.151).\n\n2. Now to give an example of a word denoting the descendent of a _Kshatriya_. We take (IV. 1. 114.) which tells us that 'the affix अण् may be added to the words which are the names of _Rishis_, or of persons belonging to the family of _Andhaka_, or _Vrishinis_ or _Kuru_.' The _Andhaka_ family, is a _Kshatriya_ family, and श्वफल्कः is a person of that family. Then श्वफल्क + अङ् = श्वाफल्कः 'a descendent of _Svaphalka_' This is a _Gotra_ descendent. In forming _Yuvan_ descendent we have श्वाफल्क + इञ्. Now this इञ् must be elided by the present _sutra_. So that श्वाफल्कः means both father and the son.\n\n3. Now to give an example of _Rishis_ family. The _sutra_ last mentioned (IV. 1. 114.) will also hold here. We take the word वसिष्टः; and वसिष्ट + अण् = वासिष्ठः; the _Yuvan_ affix इञ् will similarly be elided after his; and thus the word वासिष्ठः means both the father and the son.\n\n4. Then to take the example of _Gotra_ word formed by affixes having indicatory ञ्. Thus _sutra_ (IV. 1. 104.) declares 'the affix अञ् comes after the words विद् &c., in denoting _Gotra_ descendents.' Thus विद + अञ् = वैदः; Then add इञ् to denote _Yuvan_ descent, and we have वैदः + इञ्. By the present rule this इञ् is elided and thus we have वैदः both for the father and the son.\n\nThe above examples show the elision of the affix इञ्. Now we shall give example of the elision of the affix अण्. Now rule (IV.1. 154) says 'the affix फिञ् comes after the words तिक् &c., in denoting descendent.' Thus तिक + फिञ् = तैकायनिः (VII. 1. 2.) Then to form the _Yuvan_ descended we add अण् by (IV. 1. 83). Thus तैकायनि + अण्. By the present _sutra_, this अण् is elided, and we have तैकायनिः both applicable to the father and the son. Other examples can be multiplied.\n\nWhy do we say 'there is elision only after these words'? The _Yuvan_ affix will not be elided after other words. Thus rule (IV. 1. 112) says:- 'The affix अण् comes after शिव &c., in forming _Gotra_. कौहड + अण् = कौहड. Now this is neither a word formed by ण्य nor is it the name of a _Kshatriya_ or a _Rishi_; nor any affix having ञ goes to form it. Therefore the _Yuvan_ affix इञ् will not be elided after this. Thus कौहड + इञ् (IV. 1. 95) कौहडिः 'son of _Kauhada_.'\n\nWhy do we say 'affix denoting _Yuvan_ descendent is elided'? An affix not denoting a _Yuvan_ descendent will not be elided. Thus the pupils of वामरथ्य are called वामरथ्याः which word is thus formed: वामरथ + ण्य = वामरथ्यः 'a descendent of _Vamaratha_' (IV. 1. 115). Then to denote pupils we add अण् by (IV. 2. 111). Thus वामरथ्य + अण् = वामरथ्यः 'a pupil of _Vamarathya_.'\n\nWhy do we say '_Yuvan_ affix अण् and इञ् are elided'? The other _Yuvan_ affixes under similar circumstances are not elided. Thus the _Yuvan_ descendent of दाक्षि (grandson of दक्ष) will be दाक्षायणः Here the affix फक् (IV.1. 101) is not elided.\n\nVart:- All _Yuvan_ affixes are elided after _Gotra_ words not denoting Brahmin _Gotras_; as वौधिः applies equally to father and son; जाबालिः father, जाबालिः son; औदुम्बरिः father, औदुम्बरिः son; भाण्डीजङ्घेः father, भाण्डीजङ्घेः son. Here, first इङ् is added by (IV. 1. 173), then फक् to denote _Yuvan_ descendent. Then this फक् is elided by the present _Vartika_.",
    "24059": "पीला + अण = पैलः (IV. 1. 118). 'The _Gotra_ descendent of _Paila_.' पैलः + फिञ् (IV. 1. 156). The present rule intervenes, and the _Yuvan_ affix फिञ् is elided; so पैल is both a _Gotra_ and a _Yuvan_ word. Some say that the '_Paila_ &c. words are formed by the affix इञ्; (IV. 1. 95) and then the _luk_-elision of the _Yuvan_ affix would be valid by the next rule (II. 4. 60). They would limit the scope of the present _sutra_ to cases where the _Gotra_ of the people is not known, the _Prachyas_ not being indicated.\n\n1. पैल. 2. शालङ्कि 3. सात्यकि. 4. सात्यकामि. 5. राहवि. 6. रावणि. 7. औदञ्जि. 8. औदव्रजि. 9. औदमेघि. 10. औदव्यज्रि. 11. औदमज्जि. 12. औदभृज्जि. 13. दैवस्थानि. 14. पैङ्गलायनी. 15. राहक्षति. 16. भौलिङ्गि. 17. राणि. 18. ओदन्यि. 19. ओद्राहमानि 20. औज्जिहान. 21. औदशुद्धि. 22. तद्राजाच्चाणः. 23. तद्राज.",

So मान्यरैषणिः father and son. The word प्राचाम् here qualifies the word _Gotra_ understood and does not show that it is an optional rule in the opinion of Eastern Grammarians. When the _Gotra_ of _Prachyas_ is not denoted, there is no elision. Thus दाक्षिः and दाक्षायणः 'son of _Dakshi_.'",

So also, singular भार्गवः, plural भृगवः, singular कौत्सः, plural कुत्साः; so, वसिष्ठाः, गोतमाः, अङ्गिरसः. In all these the affix has been elided. Thus भृगु + अण् = भार्गवः 'the descendent of _Bhrigu_.'

Thus बालाकयः plural of बालाकिः, हस्तिदासयः plural of हस्तिदासिः.\n\nThough the _Bharatas_ are _Prachyas_, its specification here is to indicate that, wherever '_Prachyas_' will be used, it will not include _Bharatas_ as in (V. 4. 60).

The remaining words such as हरित &c., should not be taken in this sub-class. In the case of हरित &c., the _Gotra_ affix must be elided in the plural by Rule (II. 4. 64). Thus हरिताः किंदासाः &c.",

So also बांखरिः plural बांखरयः (IV. 1. 95) + भाण्डीरथयः = बंखरभंडीरथाः; there is elision of इञ् (IV. 1. 95). The following is a list of such compounds.\n\n1. तिककितवाः 2. बङ्खरभण्डीरथाः 3. उपकलमकाः (औपकायनाः + लाभकायमाः. (IV. 3. 99), elision of फक्) 4. पफकनरकाः (पाफकयः + नारकयः. (IV. 1. 95), elision of इञ्). वकतखगुदपरिणद्भाः, 6. उब्जककुभाः (औब्जयः (IV. 1.95). + काकुभाः (IV. 1. 112), then the elision of इञ् and अण्). 7. लङ्कशान्तमुखाः (the elision of इञ् (IV. 9. 95) as in 4). 8. उरसलंकटाः (औरसायनयः (IV. 1. 154) + लांकटयः (IV. 1. 95), elision of फिञ् and इञ्. 9. भ्रष्टक कषिष्टलाः (elision of इञ् as in 4). 10. कृष्णाजिनकृष्णसुन्दराः (elision of इञ्). 11. अग्नेवेश--दासेरकाः (आग्निवेश्यः (IV. 1. 105) + दासेरकयः (IV. 1. 95), elision of both यञ् and इञ्).",
    "24069": "Of the words belonging to this list, three have already been enumerated in the group of _Tika_-_kitavadi_ of the last _sutra_. The elision is invariable in the _Dvandva_ compound of these three, but when used separately the elision is optional. As, उपकलमकाः, भ्रष्टककपिष्ठलाः, कृष्णाजिनकृष्णसुन्दराः. But the plurals of औपकायनयः, the _Gotra_-derivative of उपक (IV. I. 99) is उपकाः or औपकायमाः; of लामकायनः is लमकाः or लामकायनाः; of भ्रष्टकि is भ्राष्टकाः or भ्राष्टकयः. The plural of कापिष्ठलिः is कपिष्टलाः or कापिष्टलयः. The plural of कार्ष्णाजिनिः is कृष्णाजिनाः or कार्ष्णाजिनयः. The plural of कृष्णसुन्दरः is कृष्णसुन्दराः or कार्ष्णसुन्दरयः.\n\nOf the rest of the words belonging to this group, there is option allowed, both when they occur in _Dvandva_ compound or when used alone.

    "24070": "The plural of आगस्त्य is अगस्तयः (as if it was the plural of अगस्ति) and of कौण्डिन्यः is कुण्डिनाः. The affix अण् (IV. I. 114.) after आगस्त्य and the affix यञ्  (IV. 1. 105) after कौण्डिन्य are elided.\n\nThe च in कुण्डिनच् is indicatory and regulates the accent (IV. 1. 163); the word कुण्डिन has _udatta_ on the middle vowel; and its substitute will also have the same accent. There is no elision however in आगस्तीयाश्छात्रा (IV. 1. 89) कौण्डिनाश्छात्राः (IV. 2. III).",
    "24071": "A noun is changed into a root (धातु) when it is made a denominative verb. As पुत्रीयति (III. 1. 8) he wishes for a son of his own. A noun which forms part of a compound becomes a crude-form (1. 2. 46); as कष्टश्रितः 'having recourse to pain.' राजपुरुषः 'king's man.' In all these examples, the case affixes have been elided.\n\nThus पुत्रम् इच्छति = पुत्रीयति, here the 2nd case-affix is elided. कष्टश्रितः = कष्टश्रित &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it gets the name of : धातु or प्रातिपदिक ?\n\nBecause when it gets any other name, such as अङ्क &c., the case-affix is not elided. Thus वृक्षः, प्लक्षः ।",
    "24072": "Thus अद् + शप् + ति = अत्ति 'he eats'; हन्ति 'he kills;' द्वेष्टि 'he envies.' The _Adadi_ verbs belong to the second conjugation. In this class of verbs, therefore, the terminations are added direct to the root.",
    "24073": "There is elision in other conjugations than _Adadi_; and there is sometimes even no elision in _Adadi_ verbs. As वृत्रं हनति 'he kills _Vritra_.' हन् + शप् + ति = हनति instead of हन्ति । So also, अहिः शयते instead of शेते. (_Rig_.V. I. 32. 5). In these cases the _Vikarana_ शप् has not been elided.\n\nIn some cases the शप् is elided as त्राध्वम् नो देवाः instead of त्रायध्वम् ॥",
    "24074": "By using 'diversely' there is elision of यङ् when other affixes than अच् follow, both in the sacred and profane literature; as लोलुवः 'much cutter' (लोलुव + अव्); पोपुवः 'much purifier' समीत्रंसः from स्रंस 'to drop.' दनीध्वंसः from ध्वंस 'to fall,' the नी being added by (VII. 4. 84).\n\nSo also यङ् is elided before other affixes than अच् : thus शाकुनिकी लालपीति दुन्दुभिवीवदीति ॥ See also (I. I. 4).",
    "24075": "These verbs belong to the _Juhotyadi_ class. जुहोति 'he sacrifices' (VII. 1. 10). श्लु causes the reduplication of the root. So also बिभेति 'he fears.' निनेक्ति from निज् 'to purify, he purifies.'",
    "24076": "Elision does not take place where ordained, and takes place where not ordained. दाति प्रियाणि (instead of ददाति) 'he gives pleasant objects,' धाति instead of दधाति ।\n\nSo also there is _slu_-elision of the _vikaranas_ after roots other than those belonging to the _Juhotyadi_ class. Thus; पूर्णां विवष्टि, जनिम विवक्ति.",
    "24077": "गा is the substitute of इण् (II. 4. 45). सिच् the affix of the Aorist is elided after these verbs in the _Parasmaipada_ as जगात् 'he went, अस्थात् 'he stood,' अदात् 'he gave,' अघात् 'he held,' अपात् 'he drank,' अभूत् 'he was.'\n\nVart:- The verbs गा and पा in the aphorism mean the गा 'to go' (which is the substitute of इण्, and not गै 'to sing,') which also assumes the form गा, and पा 'to drink' and not पा 'to protect.' The verbs गा 'to sing' and पा 'to protect' will form their Aorist with सिच् without its elision; thus अगासीत् 'he sang,' अपासीत् 'he protected.'\n\nIn the _Atmanepada_ the सिच् is not elided; thus अगासातां ग्रामौ देवदत्तेन.",
    "24078": "Thus अघ्रात् or अघ्रासीत् 'he smelled;' अधात् or अधासीत् 'he drank;' अशात् or अशासीत् 'he pared,' अच्छात् or अच्छासीत् 'he cut' and असात् or असासीत् 'he destroyed.'\n\nThere is no option allowed in _Atmanepada_; thus, अघ्रासातां सुमनसौ देवदत्तेन ॥\n\nThe root धेट् is a _Ghu_ verb, and in its case, the सिच् would have been elided by the last rule also. The present declares an option.",
    "24079": "Thus अतत (VI. 4. 37) or अतनिष्ठ 'he expanded,' अतथाः or अतनिष्ठाः 'thou didst expand.' Similarly असात or असनिष्ट 'he gave.' असाथाः or असनिष्टाः 'thou didst give.'\n\nThe roots तन् and सन् must both belong to the _Atmanepada_, and not to _Parasmaipada_. Hence in the _Parasmaipada_ there is no elision of सिव्. Thus, अतनिष्ट यूयम् 'you did expand.'",
    "24080": "The word लि is the name given by ancient grammarians to the affixes of Perfect tense as well as the Aorist, or it might be common term for all tense-affixes. Thus from घस we have अक्षन in the sentence, अक्ष॑न् पि॒॒तरोऽमी॑ मदन्त पितरो॑ऽतीतृपन्त पि॒॒तरः॒॒ पित॑रः शुन्ध॑ध्वम् (_Yajurveda_. XIX 36 so also _Rig_.1. 82. 2).\n\nFrom the verb ह्वृ we have माहूर्मित्रस्य त्वम्. From नश we have प्रणङ् in the following verse मानः शंसो अररुषो धूर्तिः प्रणङ्मर्त्थस्य । रक्षा सोब्रह्मणस्पते ॥ (_Rig_. 1. 18. 3.)\n\nThe word वृ in the _sutra_ includes both वृङ् and वृञ्, as the word वेन in the following ब्रह्म॑ जज्ञा॒॒नं प्र॑थ॒॒मं पुर॒॒ स्ता॒॒द्विसी॒॒॑ मतः सुरु॒॒चो॑ वेन आवः । सयु ध॒॒न्या॒॒ उपमा अ॑स्य विष्ठाः मतश्च योनि॒॒मस॑तश्च वि वः॑ ॥ (_Yajurveda_ 13.3).\n\nFrom दह we have आधक् as in सर॑स्वत्य॒॒भिनो॑ नेषि॒॒वस्यो माप॑स्फरीः॒॒ पय॑सा॒॒ मान॒॒ आध॑क् ॥ (_Rig_.VI. 61. 14). The word आत् means verbs ending in long आ as प्रा 'to fill.' Thus, मित्रः देवानामुदगादनीकं चक्षुर्मित्रस्य वरुणस्याग्नेः । आप्रा द्यावा पृथिवी अन्तरिक्षं सूर्य आत्मा जगतस्तस्थु श्च ॥ (_Rig_. I. 115. 1.)\n\nThe root वृच gives us वर्क as in the following verse:- मा मो अस्मिन्महाधमे परा वग् र्भारभृद्यथा । संवर्गं संरथिं जवः ॥ (_Rig_. VIII 75. 12).\n\nFrom कृ we have अक्रम् as in the following verse अक्र॒॒म् कर्म॒॒ कर्म॒॒ कृतः॑ सह वा॒॒चा म॑यो॒॒ भुवा॑ । दे॒॒ वेभ्यः॑ कर्म क्र॒॒त्वास्तं॒॒ प्रेत॑ सचाभुवः ॥ (_Yajurveda_ III. 47).\n\nFrom गम we have अग्मन; as in the following verse: वृतेव यंत बहुभिर्वसवौ स्वेरमिं जागृवांसो अनुग्मन् । रूशंतमग्निं दर्शतः वृहंतं वपावंतं विश्चहा दीदिवांसं (_Rig_. VI. 1. 1).\n\nFrom जन we have अज्ञत as अज्ञत वा अस्य दन्ताः. This is an example from the _Brahman_ literature, as the word मंत्रं in the _sutra_ refers also to the _Brahman_ literature.",
    "24081": "आम् is used in forming Periphrastic Perfect ईहांचक्रे 'he endeavoured.' Here, after the verb ईहाम् all tense-affixes are elided, and the Perfect of कृ is added to form its Perfect. Similarly ऊहांचक्रे, ईक्षांचक्रे ॥",
    "24082": "Thus, तत्र शालायाम् 'in that hall'. Here the Indeclinable तत्र 'there,' does not take the feminine termination, although it is equivalent to तस्याम् 'in that.' So also कृत्वा 'having done' हित्वा &c. Here the case affix is elided.",
    "24083": "This debars _luk_-elision which was to have taken place by the last _sutra_ instead of _luk_-elision, we have आम् added to the words ending in short अ; for examples of this, see _sutra_ (II. 1. 6); as उपकुम्भं तिष्ठति '_upakumbha_ is standing'; उपकुम्भं पश्य 'see the _upakumbha_.'\n\nWhy do we say 'after words ending in short अ'? Because after _Avyayibhava_ compound ending in any other vowels there is not substitution, but there is total-elision of the case-affixes; as अधिस्त्री, अधिकुमारी.\n\nBut the ablative case-affix is not elided after _Avyayibhava_ compound ending in short अ, nor is there the अम् substitution; as उपकुम्भादानय.",
    "24084": "उपकुम्भेन or उपकुम्भम् कृतं 'done by _upakumbha_'; उपकुम्भे निधेहि or उपकुम्भम् निधेहि 'put it in the _upakumbha_.'\n\nVart:- The अम् substitution is invariable and not optional in the locative case when the _Avyayibhava_ compound denotes prosperity (II. 1.6.) or a compound of rivers (II. 1. 20) and (II. 1.  21) or a compound having a numeral for its member (II. 1. 19); as, सुमद्रम् 'well or prosperous with the _Madras_'; सुमगधम् 'well or prosperous with the _Magadhas_'; similarly उन्मत्तगङ्गम् । लोहितगङ्गम् । एकविंशतिभारद्वाजम् । The word 'diversely' establishes all these even without the _Vartika_.",
    "24085": "Thus in the _Parasmaipada_ कर्ता 'he will do,' कर्तारौ 'they two will do;' कर्तारः 'they will do.' So also in the _Atmanepada_ we have अध्येता, अध्येतारौ, अध्येतारः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'in the 3rd person'? Observe श्वः कर्तासि । श्वोऽध्येतासे ॥",
    "31001": "This is an aphorism intended solely to regulate the sense of others. From this place forward up to the end of the Fifth Book, whatsoever we shall treat of, will get the name of '_Pratyaya_' or an affix, except the '_prakriti_' or base (such as गुप्, तिम्, कित् in (III. I. 5) are bases, the affix being सन्), the '_upapada_' or dependent word (such as स्तम्ब, शकृत in (III. 2. 24) are _upapadas_), the '_upadhi_' or attribute, the special cause that occasions changes (such as पशु in III. 2. 25 is an _upadhi_); in the sutra, (III. 2. 25), the word हरति is a _prakriti_, दृति and नाथ are _upapadas_, पशु is an _upadhi_, the affix being इन्, the substitute and the augment. Such as the affixes तव्यत्, तव्य, अनीयर् taught in (III. I. 96), as कर्त्तव्यम्, करणीयम् 'to be done'.",
    "31002": "This is also an '_adhikara_' or regulating sutra, and is understood in all subsequent aphorisms; or it might also be called a '_paribhasha_' or interpreting aphorism. That which is called an affix comes after, or is placed after, the '_dhatu_' or root, or the '_pratipadika_' or crude form; as कर्त्तव्यम् and तैत्तिरीयम्.\n\nThe force of the word च 'and' in this _sutra_ is to indicate that the affixes here treated of, are to be placed after a root &c.; not so, however the affixes, may sometimes, be placed in the beginning or the middle of a word.",
    "31003": "This _sutra_ may also be treated as a _Paribhasha_ or an _Adhikara_ _sutra_. The _udatta_ accent falls on the affix, and if it consists of more than one vowel, then on the first of the vowels. Thus the affix तव्य has _udatta_ on the first अ as in कर्त्तव्यम्. This general rule of accent applies only where there is no special rule laid down. Thus, rule (VI. I.163), declares that affixes having an indicatory च will have _udatta_ on the final; those having an indicatory र have accent on the middle (VI.I.217); those that have an indicatory प are _anudatta_; those having an indicatory ज, throw the acute accent on the syllable immediately preceding the affix (VI.I.193); the affixes having an indicatory प्र and न throw the acute accent on the first syllable of the word to which they are added (VI.I.197); the _taddhita_ affix having an indicatory क  takes acute accent on the final (VI.I.165); and the affix having an indicatory त is _svarita_ (VI.I.185).",
    "31004": "This is an exception (_apavada_) to the last aphorism. As दृसदौ 'two stones'; the case-affix औ is _anudatta_; so also तृपदः; so also पचति; The third person singular affix तिप् has an indicatory प, and is _anudatta_. But not पचतः.",
    "31005": "This affix is to be added to the above verbs, when they mean to 'despise', 'to endure' and 'to heal' respectively, though they ordinarily mean 'to hide', 'to whet' and 'to dwell'. As जुगुप्सते 'he censures or despises'; तितिक्षते 'he endures patiently'; चिकित्सते 'he heals'. But गोपायति 'he protects'; तेजयति 'he sharpens'; सङ्केतयति 'he makes sign'. When सन् is added, there is reduplication of the root, by (VI.I.9). Thus, गुप् + सन् = जुगुप् + स (VII.4.62) = जुगुप्स् to which is added the third person singular termination अते = जुगुप्सते.",
    "31006": "The सन् is to be added only then, when the sense of the desiderative verb is as below: मीमांसते 'he investigates', बीभस्सते 'he loathes', दीदांसते 'he  straightens', शीशांसते 'he sharpens'. The verbs given in this and the preceding _sutra_, are Desiderative in form, but not in meaning. The word 'optionally' in the next _sutra_, may be read into this also, whereby the addition of सन् becomes optional. Thus मानयति, बाधयति, दानयति and निशानयति are also valid forms.",
    "31007": "As, कृ 'to do'; चिकीर्षति = कर्तुमिच्छति 'he wishes to do'. This is the Desiderative proper. It is optional to employ the desiderative affix, the same sense may be expressed by a phrase. The root must also be simple and not compounded with any _upasarga_, when the affix सन् is to be added. Thus प्रकर्तुमैच्छत् = प्राचिकीर्षत्.\n\nWhy do we say कर्मणः 'after (a root expressing) an object'? The affix will not come after an Instrumental case. Thus गमनेनैच्छति; here there is no affix. But गन्तुमिच्छति will be जिगमिषति.\n\nWhy do we say समानकर्तृकात् 'when the subject of the verb to wish, is also the subject of the verb denoted by the object wished' ? Observe देवदत्तस्य भोजनमिच्छति यज्ञदत्तः. Here Yajnadatta is agent of the verb इच्छति; but he is not agent of the action भोजनं; hence there is no affixing.\n\nWhy do we say इच्छायाम् 'when the sense is that of wishing'? Observe कर्तुं जानाति 'he knows how to make'; here the sense being that of knowing, there is no affix.\n\nThe word वा 'optionally' shows that a sentence may also be employed to express the same idea. Thus कर्तुमिच्छति or चिकीर्षति.\n\nThe word धातोः being especially used in this _sutra_, shows that this सन् is an _ardhadhatuka_ affix, while the सन् taught in the two preceding _sutras_, will not get this designation.\n\nVart: The affix सन् is added, when the sense is that of 'in imminent danger'; as शङ्के पतिष्यति कूलम् = पिपतिषति कूलम् 'the bank is in imminent danger of falling down'. So also श्वा मुमूर्षति.\n\nVart: There is no affixing of सन् after a verb which has alrcady taken सन् in the sense of wishing. As चिकीर्षितुमिच्छति. But the सन् of (III. I. 5, 6) not denoting wishing, we have जुगुप्सिषते, मिमांसिषते.",
    "31008": "This forms the Denominative verbs, i.e., verbs derived from nominal bases. As, पुत्र 'son', पुत्रीयति 'he wishes for a son of his own' (पुत्र + क्यच् = पुत्री + य = पुत्रीय) (II. 4. 71), (VII. 4. 33).\n\nWhy do we use the word सुप् ? The affix should not come after a whole sentence, but only after the particular word ending in the case-affix. Thus in महान्तं पुत्रमिच्छति, the affix comes only after पुत्रम् and not महान्तं पुत्रं.\n\nWhy do we say _atmanah_ ? Observe राज्ञः पुत्रमिच्छति 'he wishes a son for the king'. Here there is no affixing as the wishing is for another and not for one's own self.\n\nThe क in क्यच् is for the sake of classing _kyach_, _kyan_ and _kyash_ in one common group by simply using the word क्य, as in _sutra_ तः क्ये (I. 4. 15); while च् distinguishes _kyach_ from _kyan_ &c., and is not for the sake of accent, the affix will be _udatta_ by (III. 1. 3).\n\nVart:- In affixing _kyach_, prohibition must be stated of pronouns in म् and of Indeclinables. Thus in इदमिच्छति, उच्चैरिच्छति, there is no affixing.\n\nVart:- In the Vedas, the affix is added even when the wish is with regard to another. As मा त्वा वृका अघायवो विदन्. Here अघायु (pl. अघायवः) is formed by _kyach_, अ being added by (III.2.170), and आ is added by (VII.4. 37). See Rig Veda (I. 120.7; 27.3) &c.",
    "31009": "Thus, पुत्रकाम्यति 'he wishes for a son of his own'.\n\nThe making of this a separate _sutra_ instead of adding it with the last aphorism and making one _sutra_ of them both, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, where the _anuvritti_ of _kyach_ only runs, and not that of _kamyach_. The क of _kamyach_ is not indicatory, but is a part of the real affix. Here, therefore, rule (I.3.8) which would have made the letter क indicatory, does not apply; because no particular purpose would be served by making indicatory. Or the affix _kamyach_ may be considered to have an indicatory च before it i.e. the affix being _chakamya_.",
    "31010": "Thus, पुत्रमिवाचरति छात्रं = पुत्रीयति छात्रम् 'he treats the pupil as a son'\n\nVart: So also in a locative case. As प्रासादीयति कुड्ये 'he dwells in hut as if it were a palace'. पर्यङ्कीयति मञ्चके 'in a cot he lies down as if he were on a royal bedstead; he treats a cot as a royal bedstead'.",
    "31011": "Thus, श्येनेवाचरति काकः, श्येनायते, 'the crow behaves like a hawk'; अप्सरायते 'she behaves like an _Apsara_'; पयस्यते or पयायते 'it becomes milk'; (श्येन + य = श्येना + य = श्येनाय, (VII. 4. 25)).\n\nIn the words ओजस् — औजायते, and अप्सरस् — अप्सरायते the final स् is invariably elided when forming the denominative verb : but not so in the case of पयस् where the elision is optional, as पयायते or पयस्यते.\n\nThe elision of स् refers to the final स् and not when it is followed by any vowel. Thus हंस – हंसायते; सारस – सारसायते; here the स is not elided as it is not final. See. (I. 1. 52).\n\nVart:- After the words अवगल्भ, क्लीब, and होड, the affix क्विप् is optionally added in the sense of behaving like some one or some thing. As अवगल्भते or अवगल्भायते, क्लीबते or क्लीबायते, होडते or होडायते. The alternative forms are derived by the affixing of _kyan_.\n\nVart:- According to the opinion of some Grammarians, the affix क्विप् comes optionally in this sense after all crude nouns. As अश्वति or अश्वायते, गर्दभति or गर्दभायते.",
    "31012": "Thus, अभृशो भृशो भवति = भृशायते 'he becomes much (from a little)'; शीघ्रायते 'he becomes swift (from being tardy)'. All these roots will be _Atmanepadi_ (I.3.12).\n\nThe phrase अच्वेः 'not ending in the adverbial affix ई', refers to every one of the words belonging to the class भ्रिशादि. It may be objected, what was the necessity of adding this condition, since the affix च्वि itself denotes that something has become what it was not before; and therefore a word which has taken the affix च्वि, will not again take क्यङ् in that very sense. The repetition of च्वि here shows that the words भृश् &c. never take the affix च्वि, in the sense of 'something becoming what it was not before'. Thus the present _sutra_ is an exception to _sutra_ (V. 4.50) which ordains च्वि.\n\nभृशादिः\n\nभृश्, शीघ्, मन्द, चपल, पण्डित, उत्सुक, उन्मनस्, अभिमनस्, सुमनस्, दुर्म्मनस्, रहस्, रोहस्, शश्वत्, वहत्, वहेत्, नृपत्, शुधि, अधर, ओजस्, वर्चस्, (विमनस्, रभन्, रोहत्, हन्, शुचिस्, अरजस्) ।",
    "31013": "Thus लोहितायते or लोहितायति 'he becomes red'; पटपटायते or पटपटायति 'he makes a noise like _patapata_'; (लोहित + य = लोहिता + य = लोहिताय, (VII. 4. 25)).\n\nThe word पटपटायते is formed by adding the affix _dach_ to the word पट which is first reduplicated, and then takes the denominative affix _kyash_. The affix _dach_ is added to express inarticulate sounds.\n\nThere is no special class called _lohitadi_. The _Vartika_, therefore, proposes that the _sutra_ should read without the word _adi_, as लोहितादिभ्यः क्यष्; 'the affix _kyash_ comes after _lohita_, and words ending in _dach_'.\n\nThis rule applies to words other than भ्रिशादि which are always invariably _Atmanepadi_ owing to the ङित्, affix क्यङ्, while क्यष् is optionally both. (I. 3. 90). Thus वर्मायति or वर्मायते, निद्रायति or निद्रायते, करुणायति or करुणायते, कृपायति or कृपायते. The _lohitadi_ is an आकृतिगण, the following being some of the words of this class; लोहित, नील, हरित, पीत, मद्र, फेन and मन्द.\n\nThe indicatory क in क्यष् is not for the sake of prohibiting _guna_ and _vriddhi_ (I. 1. 5). For _guna_ or _vriddhi_ takes place in a _dhatu_ followed by a _sarvadhatuka_ or _ardhadhatuka_ affix. The affix क्यष् is not added to a _dhatu_ but to a nominal stem : hence there is no scope for the operation of _guna_ &c. The क is for the sake of grouping क्यच्, क्यङ् and क्यष् in one class as क्य; as in _sutra_ नः क्ये (I. 4. 15). There is, however, no word ending in न among those enumerated above.\n\nThe affix डाच् (V.4.57) comes when the verb following is one of the three अस्, भू, or कृ; as पटपटाकरोति, -भवति or -स्यात्. The present _sutra_ teaches by implication that when क्यष् follows डाच्, the above restriction, that the verb should be कृ, भू or अस्, is not applicable. Here डाच् comes without the addition of कृ, भू or अस्ति.\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of अच्वेः comes from the last _sutra_; and hence the affix मयप् is added in the sense of अभूततद्भाव i.e. something becoming that which it was not before.",
    "31014": "Thus, कष्टाय कर्मणे क्रामति = कष्टायते 'he is assiduous for trouble, i.e. he is assiduous in the commission of dishonesty, or he plots'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्यङ्, comes in the sense of exerting in evil, after the words सत्र, कष्ट, कक्ष, कृच्छ्र and गहन; as, सत्रायते, कष्टायते, कक्षायते, कृच्छ्रायते, and गहनायते ।\n\nWhen the sense is not of 'evil', the affix is not added, as अजः कष्टं क्रामति.",
    "31015": "Thus, रोमन्थं वर्तयति = रोमन्थायते गौः 'the cow ruminates'.\n\nVart: This is restricted to the word signifying movements of the jaws. Therefore there is no affixing here; as, कीटो रोमन्थं वर्तयति.\n\nVart:The _Parasmaipada_ affixes are used after the word तपस्; as तपश्चरति = तपस्यति, 'he performs austerity'.",
    "31016": "Thus, बाष्पायते 'it emits vapour'; उष्मायते 'it sends out heat'. So also फेनायते 'it ejects froth'.",
    "31017": "Thus, शब्दं करोति = शब्दायते 'he makes a noise'. So also वैरायते, कलहायते, अभ्रायते, कण्वायते, मेघायते ।\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the affix comes after सुदिन, दुर्दिन and नीहार; as, सुदिनायते, दुर्दिनायते, नीहारायते ।\n\nVart:- So also should be included the words अटा, अट्टा, शीका, कोटा, पोटा सोटा and कष्टा; as अटायते, अट्टायते, शीकायते, कोटायते, पोटायते, सोटायते and कष्टायते ।\n\nThe word करण in the _sutra_ is not the Grammatical _Karana_ or the Instrumental case, but has here its primary meaning of 'doing'.",
    "31018": "Thus सुखायते ' he feels pleasure';  दुःखायते 'he feels pain'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the feeling belongs to the agent'? Observe सुखं वेदयति प्रसाधको देवदत्तस्य 'the valet knows the happiness of his master Devadatta'.  Here the agent viz. a valet, is not the percipient of the 'happiness', which belongs to his master; hence there is no affixing.\n\nसुखादिः।\n\nसुख, दुःख, तृप्त, गहन, कृच्छ्र, अस्, अलीक, प्रतीप, करुण, कृपण, सोट ।",
    "31019": "Thus नमस्यति देवान्, 'he worships the gods'; वरिवस्यति गुरून्, 'he honors or serves the elders'; चित्रीयते 'he astonishes (makes it wonderful)'. The ङ् in चित्रङ् indicates that it takes the affixes of the _Atmanepada_. (चित्र + य = चित्री + य (VII. 4. 33) = चित्रीय).",
    "31020": "Thus उत्पुच्छयते 'he lifts up the tail', (the sense must be that of lifting or throwing about); सम्भाण्डायते 'he collects pots in a heap'; सञ्चीवरायते भिक्षुः 'the beggar collects or wears rags'. Of the affix णिङ्, the effective portion is इ, the other letters are servile. The ङ indicates _Atmanepada_ (I. 3. 12)and ण serves the purposes of the application of the rule (VI. 4. 51) which applies generally to all affixes containing णि, such as णिङ्, णिच् &c.\n\nVart:- After the word पुच्छ् the sense of the affix is that of lifting or throwing about.\n\nVart:- After भाण्ड the sense of the affix is that of accumulation in a heap.\n\nVart:- After चीवर the sense of the affix is that of acquiring or wearing.",
    "31021": "Thus मुण्डयति 'he shaves'; मिश्रयति 'he mixes'; श्लक्ष्णयति 'he softens or alleviates'; लवणयति 'he salts'; पयोव्रतयति 'he fasts on milk'; संवस्त्रयति 'he covers with clothes i.e. dresses'; हलयति 'he ploughs'; कलयति 'he makes war'; कृतयति 'he appreciates kindness'; वितूस्तयति 'he combs the hair, or disentangles matted hair or delivers from sin'.\n\nThe affix after the word व्रत has the sense of 'eating' or 'abstaining therefrom'; as पयो व्रतयति 'he drinks milk', वृषलान्नं व्रतयति 'he abstains from the food prepared by a low caste'; after the word वस्त्र the affix denotes the sense of covering. After हलि and कलि the sense is that of taking; as हलिं गृह्णाति = हलयति. The words in the _sutra_ are हल and कल and not हलि and कलि. This anomalous form shows that in forming the Aorist of these by adding the affix चङ् (III. I. 48) the reduplication takes place, but not in the same way as if the affix were सम्, i.e. the सन्वद्भाव does not take place here in the Aorist (VII. 4. 93). Thus the Aorists are अजहलत् and अचकलत्; and not अजीहलत् and अचीकलत् which would have been the forms by the application of rules (VII.4.79. & 94). if there was सन्वद्भाव.\n\nThe word स्तूत means either hair, or matted hair, or sin.",
    "31022": "The phrase _kriya-samabhihara_ means repetition of the act or its intensity. As पच् 'to cook', पापच्यते 'he cooks again and again'; जाज्वल्यते 'he shines with great intensity'. The root must be a simple root, and not compounded with any _upasarga_. We cannot therefore make Intensives of verbs like प्राट् 'to go', (because the root अट्, is preceded by the _upasarga_ प्र); or जागृ 'to be awake,' (because it contains two vowels); or ईक्ष् 'to see' (because it begins with a vowel).\n\nVart:- The intensive affix यङ् comes after सुचि, सूत्रि, मूत्रि, अटि, अर्ति, अश and अर्ण, though some of these contain more than two vowels and others begin with a vowel.\n\nAs, सोसूच्यते, सोसूत्र्यते, मोमूत्र्यते, अटाट्यते, अरार्यते, अशाश्यते, and पोर्णोनूयते.\n\nThe affix is not added in these cases भृशं शोभते or भृशं रोचते, as it is against usage to make Intensive forms of these verbs on the sense of intensity, though in the sense of repetition we have रोरुच्यते and शोशुभ्यते.\n\nIn making the Intensives, the root is reduplicated and it takes the terminations of the _Atmanepada_ as the root is ङित्.",
    "31023": "Thus क्रम् 'to move', चङ्क्रम्यते 'he moves crookedly'. So also दन्द्रम्यते. After a verb of motion, the यङ् never expresses intensity or repetition; so if the latter sense is to be expressed, a phrase must be employed; as भृशं क्रामति 'he wanders much'. This is inferred from the word नित्य used in the _sutra_ i. e. यङ् always has the sense of crookedness and no other sense after a verb of motion.",
    "31024": "Thus लोलुप्यते 'he cuts off badly'; सासद्यते 'he sits badly'; चञ्चूर्यते 'he walks badly'; जञ्जप्यते 'he recites badly' ; so also जञ्जभ्यते, दन्दह्यते, दन्दश्यते, निजेगिल्यते. The affix यङ्, does not come in the sense of repetition &c. after the above verbs, but only in the sense of censurable performance of the action denoted by the verbs. Separate words must be used to express the intensive or the frequentative meaning. As भृशं लुम्पति 'he cuts off much'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when contempt in regard to the sense of the root is meant'? Observe साधु जपति 'he recites well'. There is no affixing as no contempt is denoted. Why do we say 'in regard to the action denoted by the root'? When the contempt is not with regard to the sense of the root, but with regard to the action as accomplished, the affix is not employed. Thus मन्त्रं जपति वृषलः 'the _Sudra_ recites the sacred _mantras_'. The word नित्य of the last aphorism is understood here also.",
    "31025": "Thus सत्यापयति 'he speaks truly'; विपाशयति 'he unfetters or liberates'; रूपयति 'he looks'; उपवीणयति 'he sings with the lute'; अनुतूलयति 'he makes a brush'; उपश्लोकयति 'he praises in verse'; अभिषेणयति 'he advances with the army'; अनोलोमयति 'he rubs over the hair'; त्वचयति 'he feels of the skin'; संवर्मयति 'he puts on the mail armour'; वर्णयति 'he celebrates or colors'; अवचूर्णयति he pulverises. The roots of the _Churadi_ class belong to the tenth conjugation, for a list of which see the _Dhatupatha_. After the verbs of the _Churadi_ class, the affix णिच् is employed without alteration of the sense; as चोरयति 'he steals'. So also चिन्तयति.\n\nVart:- The words अर्थ, वेद and सत्य take the augment आप् before the affix णिच्; as, सत्यापयति, अर्थापयति, वेदापयति. The whole equation is thus shown अर्थ + आपुक् + णिच् + शप् + तिप् = अर्थ +  आप्+ इ +अति = अर्थापि + अति = अर्थापयति (VII. 3. 85). The final syllable called टि is not elided in this case, i.e. of अर्थाप् the syllable आप् is not elided before णिच्, as it would have been by (VI.4.155). The reason is that if आप् was to be elided, there would have been no necessity of adding it. The affix णिच् has the sense of 'unfettering' after the word पाश, of 'seeing' after रूप, of 'singing in accompaniment' after वीणा, of 'brushing' after तूल, of 'praising' after श्लोक, of 'leading' after सेना, of 'rubbing' after लोम, of 'taking' after स्वच्, of 'putting on' after वर्म and of 'taking' after वर्ण.",
    "31026": "The _hetu_ (I. 4.55) means the mover of the independent agent; an operation relating to the _hetu_, such as directing &c. is called _hetumat_; as कठं कारयति 'he causes to prepare a mat'; ओदनं पाचवति 'he makes the rice to be cooked'. In other words, the affix णिच् forms the causative verbs.\n\nVart:- The affix comes also in the sense of 'he does that' after the words सूत्र &c. Thus सत्रं करोति = सूत्रयति 'he makes _sutra_' So also सूत्रयति.\n\nVart:- After words ending in कृत् affixes and describing legends, comes the affix णिच्, when the sense is ‘he does that'. The कृत् affix is elided, the word reassumes its basic (प्राकृतिक) form, and the base is as if the agent, thus कंसवधिमाचष्टे = कंसं घातयति; बलिबन्धमाचष्टे = बलिं बन्धयति; राजागमनमाचष्टे = राजानम् आगमयति.\n\nVart:- Under the conditions mentioned in the last वार्तिक, the _upasarga_ आ is elided, when duration of time is meant expressing limit. Thus आरात्रिविवासं आचष्टे = रात्रिं विवासयति; here the आ of आरात्रि is elided.\n\nVart:- Under the conditions mentioned in the second _vartika_ the affix णिच् has the sense of 'making wonderful', 'meaning attaining that'. Thus उज्जयिन्याः प्रस्थितो माहिष्मत्यां सूर्योद्गमनं सम्भावयते = सूर्यमुद्गमयति 'going from _Ujjain_ he finds the sun rise in _Mahismati_ (wonderful speed)'.\n\nVart :- When an asterism is in composition and the sense is that of knowing, there comes the affix णिच् after a word ending in कृत् affix, the कृत् affix is elided, the word reassumes its basic form and the base is as if the agent. Thus पुष्ययोगं जानाति = पुष्येण योजयति. So also मघाभिर्योजयति.",
    "31027": "Thus, कण्डूयति or कण्डूयते 'he itches or scratches'. This word takes terminations indicatory. The words कण्डु &c. are both roots and nouns, and are placed therefore in a separate list by themselves and are not included in the general list of verbs. The affix applies to those words as roots and not as nouns.\n\nकण्ड्वादिः ।\n\nकण्डूञ्, मन्तु, ह्रणीञ्, वल्गु, अस्त्र, मनस्, महीङ्, लेट्, लोट्, इरस्, इरज्, इरञ्, द्रवस्, मेधा, कुषुभ, मगध, तन्तस्, पम्पस्, सुख, दुःख, सपर, अर, भिषज्, भिष्णज्, इषुध, चरण, चुरण, भुरण, तुरण, गद्गद, एला, केला, खेला, लिट् and लोट् ।",
    "31028": "Thus गोपायति 'he protects'; धूपायति 'he heats'; so also, विच्छायति, पणायति, and पनायति.\n\nThe verb पण् being read along with पन् 'to praise,' has here the sense of praise only; so that the affix does not come after the verb पण् when it means 'to make a contract'; as शतस्य पणते, सहस्रस्य पणते.\n\nThe verbs in आय do not take _Atmanepada_ affixes, as there is no indicatory letter to show that.",
    "31029": "The indicatory ङ shows that the verb will take the affixes of the _Atmanepada_; as ऋतीयते 'he pities or reproaches'; so also, ऋतीयाते, ऋतीयन्ते.",
    "31030": "The ण indicates _vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 115) and ङ shows _Atmanepada_; as, कामयते 'he desires'; so also कामयेते and कामयन्ते.",
    "31031": "Thus ता 3rd. sing. of the Future is an _ardhadhatuka_ affix. It is optional to retain the _aya_ of _gopaya_ before this affix. So we have गोपायिता or गोप्ता 'he will protect'. So also अर्तिता or ऋतीयिता; कमिता or कामयिता.\n\nBut for this _sutra_, the affixes आय &c. would have come always even when _ardhadhatuka_ affixes were to be applied. This makes it optional. Therefore proper _ardhadhatuka_ affixes should be applied when we retain आय &c. and when we do not retain them. Thus the _ardhadhatuka_ क्तिन् (III. 3. 95) will be employed in forming the feminine noun from the simple root, but the _ardhadhatuka_ अ (III. 3. 102) will be employed in forming the feminine when आय &c. are retained. Thus गुप्तिः or गोपावा.",
    "31032": "This extends the sphere of _Dhatu_ or roots already defined in _sutra_ (I. 3. 1). These roots may be called derivative roots. They are separate independent roots, and have all the functions of a root, as taking tense-affixes &c. as shown in the above examples. Thus चिकीर्षा 'to wish to do', कारि 'to cause to do'; चेक्रिय 'to do repeatedly' are separate roots and not the same as कृ 'to do' and thus take शप् &c.",
    "31033": "लृ is the common expression for लृङ् and लृट् formed by rejecting their special _anubandhas_, and means therefore the 2nd Future and the Conditional tenses. लुट् is the 1st Future also called the Periphrastic Future. Thus करिष्यति अकरिष्यत्, कर्ता. The इ of तासि is indicatory and shows that the nasal of the root is not to be dropped before this; as मन् 'to think', मन्ता 'he will think'.",
    "31034": "The tense called लेट् or subjunctive is found in the _Vedas_ only. When the subjunctive tense is employed, the affix सिप् is diversely added.\n\nThus जोषिषत्, तारिषत्, मन्दिषत्. Sometimes this augment is not employed; thus पताति दिद्युत् उदधिं ज्यावयाति. Thus in _Rig Veda_ (I. I. 2), वक्षति is an example of लेट् with सिप् ॥",
    "31035": "This forms the Periphrastic Perfect. The Perfect of कास् will be कासाम्, after which the terminations of the Perfect are all elided (II. 4. 81) and instead, the perfect tense of the auxiliary verb भू or अस् is added. As कासाञ्चक्रे 'he coughed'; चोरयामास 'he stole'. So also लोलूवाञ्चक्रे.\n\nThis rule however does not apply to the _Vedas_; as कृष्णो नोनाव _Rig. Veda_ (I. 79.2).\n\nVart:- This rule also applies where the root is polysyllabic consisting of more than one vowel; as चुलुम्पाञ्चकार, दरिद्राञ्चकार ॥\n\nThe final म् of आम् is not indicatory.",
    "31036": "Thus ईह् 'to try', ईहाञ्चक्रे 'he tried'; so also ऊहाञ्चक्रे 'he guessed', एधाञ्चक्रे 'he grieved'.\n\nBut ऋच्छ् forms आनर्च्छ 'he failed or went'. This applies to monosyllabic roots which begin with any vowel prosodially long, except अ or आ. The verb ऊर्ण 'to cover' is, however, an exception; its perfect is ऊर्णुनाव 'he covered'.\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with इच् or any vowel except अ or आ' ? Observe अर्द, Perfect आनर्द (VII. 4.71). Why do we say 'heavy vowel' ? Observe उख्, Perf. उवोख (VI. 4.78) ऊखतुः, ऊखुः. Why do we say 'vowel' ? Observe कुर्द, Perf. चुकुर्दे; षूद्, Perf. सुषूदे.",
    "31037": "Thus दयाञ्चके 'he gave'; पलायाञ्चक्रे 'he ran away'; आसाञ्चक्रे 'he sat'.",
    "31038": "Thus ओषाञ्चकार or उवोष, विदाञ्चकार or विवेद, जागराञ्चकार or जजागार. As there is an agreement in the present instance to regard the verb विद as ending in a short अ, _guna_ is not substituted, as it would otherwise have been by rule (VII. 3. 86).",
    "31039": "The effect of श्लु is to cause reduplication by rule (VI. 1. 10). As विभयाञ्चकार or विभाय, जिह्रवाञ्चकार or जिह्राय, विभराञ्चकार or बभार, जुहवाञ्चकार or जुहाव.",
    "31040": "After the above verbs formed by taking the augment आम् the perfect tense of कृ is added to form their Perfect. This has already been illustrated in the above examples. The word कृ includes also the verbs भू and अस्. All these three may be used as auxiliaries. The verb अस् when used as an auxiliary, is not replaced by भू (III. 4. 52) before the लिट् affixes which are _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Thus पाचयाञ्चकार, पाचयाम्बभूव, पाचयामास.",
    "31041": "This irregular form is obtained by adding the affix आम् to the root विद् 'to know,' when followed by लोट् or the Imperative tense; the tense-affixes of लोट् are then elided by _luk_; moreover there is no substitution of _guna_ as required by (VII. 3. 86); and when we have thus obtained the form विदाम्, we annex to it the लोट् of the verb कृ; thus we have विदाङ्कुर्वन्तु or विदन्तु 'let them know'. The third person plural is not only intended to be spoken of by the employment of the form विदाङ्कुर्वन्तु in the aphorism; on the contrary, the word इति shows that all the numbers and persons of the Imperative may be so employed; as विदाङ्करोतु विदाङ्कुरुताम् &c.",
    "31042": "The first two of these and the fourth are the Aorists (लुङ्) of the causatives of the roots सद् 'to sit', जन् 'to be born', and रम् 'to sport': to which the affix आम् is added. The third is the Aorist of the root चि 'to collect', to which आम् has been added after the reduplication and the change of च into क of the root. The auxiliary अकः is added to all these four. The fifth is derived from the root पू 'to blow, to purify', by adding the causative affix णिच्, annexing the affix आम् before the terminations of the Potential (लिङ्) and then using after the form so obtained, the auxiliary क्रियात्. The last is the Aorist of विद् 'to know', to which आम् is added and the auxiliary अक्रन् is employed. These are the archaic forms; their modern forms are as follow:- अभ्युदसीषदत्, प्राजीजनत्, अचैषीत्, अरीरमत्, पाव्याद, अवेदिषुः ।",
    "31043": "The इ of च्लि is for the sake of articulation, the च is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 162.) showing that an affix which has an indicatory च has _udatta_ on its final. Then remains only लि, which after all, is to be replaced by other affixes, as we shall show below. In fact च्लि is the common name for all Aorist affixes.",
    "31044": "The इ of सिच् is for the sake of pronunciation, the च is for accent, and the real affix is स्; as अकार्षीत् 'he did'. When सिच् is added, the terminations of the Aorist assume the following forms.\n\n_Parasmaipada_.\n\n- 1st person, सं, स्व, स्म  \n- 2nd person, सीः, स्तं, तं, स्त, त\n- 3rd person, सीत्, स्तां, तां, सुः\n\n_Atmanepada_.\n\n- 1st person, सि, स्वहि, स्महि\n- 2nd person, स्थाः, थाः, साथां, ध्वं\n- 3rd person, स्त, त, सातां, सत\n\nThe substitution of सिच् is optional in the Aorist of the roots स्पृश् 'to touch', मृश् 'to rub', कृष् 'to plough', तृप् 'to become satisfied', and दृप् 'to light'. Thus the Aorist of स्पृश् has three forms; अस्प्राक्षीत्; अस्पार्क्षीत्, or अस्पृक्षत्. Similarly मृश् has अम्राक्षीत्, अमार्क्षीत् or अमृक्षत्; कृष्, अकार्षीत् अक्राक्षीत् or अकृक्षत्; तृप्, अतार्प्सीत्, अत्राप्सीत्, or अतृपत्; दृप्, अद्राप्सीत्, अदार्प्सीत् or अदृपत् ।",
    "31045": "The forms of the terminations of the Aorist with क्स are as follow:\n\n_Parasmaipada_.\n\n- 1st person, सं, साव, साम्\n- 2nd person, सः, सत, सत\n- 3rd person, सत्, सतां, सत्\n\n_Almanepada_.\n\n- सि, सीवहि, सीमहि\n- सथाः, थाः, साथाम्, सध्वम्, ध्वम्\n- सत, त, सातां, सन्त\n\nAs, मृश and कृष् in the last _sutra_ have their Aorist with क्स as अमृक्सत् and अकृषत्; so दुह 'to milk' forms अधुक्षत् 'he milked', लिड् 'to lick' अलिक्षत्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when ending in श, ष, and ह'? Observe अभैत्सीत्, अच्छैत्सीत्; here सिच् is employed. Why do we say 'having for its penultimate इ, उ, ऋ or लृ'? Observe अधाक्षीत्. Why do we say 'not having an intermediate इ'? Observe अकोषीत् an अमोषीत्. See (VII. 2. 4) and (VIII. 2. 28).",
    "31046": "This is a restrictive aphorism. As आश्लिक्षत् कन्याम् 'he embraced the girl'. But समाश्लिषज्जतुकाष्ठम् 'the glue joined the wood'.",
    "31047": "This is an exception to the _sutra_ (III. 1.45.) enjoining क्स. The root दृश् will form its Aorists by (III. I. 57.) and will take अङ् and सिच्; as अदर्शत् or अद्राक्षीत् 'he saw'.",
    "31048": "The ङ prevents _guna_ and _vriddhi_ and च is to distinguish it from अङ्. When चङ् is added, there is reduplication (VI. I. II). The usual terminations of the Imperfect are employed after the root, when चङ् is used; as अचीकरत् 'he caused to make'; अशिश्रियत् 'he served or went'; अदुद्रुवत् 'he ran'; असुस्रुवत् 'it flowed'. This form is not used in Passive; as, अकारयिषाताम्.\n\nThe root कम् 'to love' should also be included in this rule. कम्, when it takes the affix णिङ् (III. I. 30) will of course be included in this _sutra_, by virtue of its ending in णि; the _Vartika_ makes the additional statement that even when the root कम् does not take the affix णिङ्, the present aphorism must apply to it. Thus we have अचकमत् 'he loved'; when it takes णिङ्, the Aorist will be अचीकमत् (VII. 4. 93, 79, 94.)",
    "31049": "As, अदधत्, 'he sucked'. When it takes the alternative सिच्, then rule (II. 4. 78.) comes into operation, and we have अधात् and अधासीत् 'he sucked'. So also of श्वि, we have अशिश्वियत् 'he grew'. It also takes the अङ्, (III. I. 58) and then its form is अश्वत् or अश्वयीत्.",
    "31050": "This rule applies where the root गुप् does not take the affix आय (II. I. 28). As इमान् नो मित्रावरुणौ यत् गृहान् अजुगुपतम् '_Mitra_ _Varuna_ protected these our houses'. The other forms are अगौप्तम्, अगोपिष्टम् or आगोपायिष्टम्. In the secular literature, the latter three forms are used, but not the first.",
    "31051": "Thus we have ऊनयीः in the _Vedas_; औनिनस् in the classical literature; so also ध्वनयीत्, ऐलयीः and अर्दयीत्; their classical forms being अदिध्वनत् , ऐलिलत्, an आर्दिदत्. See _Rig Veda_ (I. 53, 3), (I. 162. 15.) and _Panini_ (VII 2. 5).",
    "31052": "वच् may be either the root, or the substitute of ब्रू (II. 4. 53) and so also ख्या may be the root, or the substitute of चक्ष् (II. 4. 54). The root अस् belonging to the दिवादि or the Fourth conjugation, falls under the subdivision पुषादि, and therefore it would have taken अङ् in the _Parasmaipada_ by rule (III. I. 55). The repetition is to indicate that it takes अङ्, in the _Atamanepada_ also; as पर्यास्थत (VII. 4. 17), अवोचत् and आख्यत्. In the Passive, we have पर्यासिषाताम्.",
    "31053": "Thus अलिपत् 'he painted or wrote'; असिचत्, 'he sprinkled; and आहूत् 'he called or challenged'.",
    "31054": "Thus अलिपत or अलिप्त 'he painted'; असिचत or असिक्त 'he sprinkled'; आह्वत or आह्वास्त 'he challenged'.",
    "31055": "The verbs classed as पुषादि, are a sub-division of the 4th conjugational verbs; and द्युतादि verbs belong to the Ist conjugation. As पुष्, अपुषत् 'he nourished'; द्युत्, अद्युतत् 'he shone'; गम्लृ, अगमत् 'he went'. But not so in the _Atmanepada_; as व्यद्योतिष्ट, अलोतिष्ट.",
    "31056": "Thus असरत् 'he went'; अशिषत् 'he ordered'; आरत् 'he went'. This _sutra_ has been separately enunciated in order to make the rule applicable to _Atmanepada_; as समरन्त (I. 3. 29). The च in the text is for the sake of drawing the _anuvritti_ of the phrase 'in the _Parasmaipada_' of the last _sutra_, into the present and its _anuvriti_ will extend to future _sutras_ also.",
    "31057": "Thus from भिदिर् (भिद) 'to divide', we derive अभिदत् or अभैत्सीत्. But we have अभित्त in the _Atmanepada_. So from छिदिर् – अच्छिदत् or अच्छैत्सीत्.",
    "31058": "Thus अजरत् or अजारीत् 'he grew old'; अस्तम्भत् or अस्तम्भीत् 'he stiffened'; अम्रुचत् or अम्रोचीत् 'he went'; अम्लुचत् or अम्लोचीत् 'he went'; अग्रुचत् or अग्रोचीत् 'he stole'; अग्लुचत् or अग्लोचीत् 'he stole'; अग्लुञ्चत् or अग्लुञ्चीत् 'he went'; अश्वत्, भरवयीत, अश्वयीत् or अशिश्वियत् 'he grew'. The roots ग्लुच् and ग्लुञ्च् both give rise to the same three forms, viz. अग्लुचत्, अग्लुञ्चत् and अग्लञ्चोत्. The use of one root would, therefore, have served this purpose. The employment of both indicates separateness of their meanings. Others say that the use of both roots indicates that in the case of ग्लुञ्च, the nasal is never elided. Thus the Aorist of ग्लुञ्च will be अग्लुञ्चत् and अग्लुञ्चीत्.",
    "31059": "Thus अकरत् 'he did'; अमरत् 'he died'; अदरत् 'he tore'; आरुहत् 'he rose'. See _Rig Veda_ (X. 85. 17), (X. 44. 6). The classical Aorist of these verbs are अकार्षीत्, अमृत, अदारीत् and अरुक्षत्.",
    "31060": "The affix त here means the third person singular tense-affix of the _Atmanepada_; as अपादि 'he went'; but not so in the dual and plural; as अपसाताम् 'they two went'; अपत्सत् 'they went'; अट् + पद + चिण् + त = अ + पाद् + त = अपादि (the affix त being elided by rule (VI. 4. 104)).",
    "31061": "Thus अदीपि or अदीपिष्ट 'he shone'; अजनि or अजनिष्ट 'he was produced'; अबोधि or अबुद्ध 'he knew'; अपूरि or अपूरिष्ट 'he was full'; अतायि or अतायिष्ट 'he extended'; अप्यायि or अप्यायिष्ट 'he grew'.",
    "31062": "A reflective verb is one in which the object is spoken of as the agent. In reflective verbs therefore, चिण् is employed after roots ending in vowels; as अकारि कटः स्वयमेव 'the mat became made of itself. This is an optional rule (प्राप्तविभाषा). Therefore we have also अकृत कटः स्वयमेव; similarly अलावि or अलविष्ट केदारः स्वयमेव 'the embankment broke of itself.\n\nBut in verbs other than those that end in vowels, i.e. in those which end with a consonant, the चिण् is obligatory in the reflective voice, and not optional; as अभेदि काष्ठम् स्वयमेव 'the wood split of itself'. So also in verbs other than reflexives; as अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन.",
    "31063": "Thus अदोहि or अदुग्ध गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow milked of itself'. In verbs other than reflexive, the चिण् is compulsary, e.g. अदोहि गौर्गोपालकेन 'the cow was milked by the cowherd'.",
    "31064": "Thus अन्ववारुद्ध गौ स्वयमेव 'the cow was obstructed of itself'. In verbs other than reflexive, चिण् is employed, e. g. अन्ववारोधि गौर्गोपालकेन.",
    "31065": "This prohibition applies even to the passive and impersonal voices of the verb तप्; as अतप्त तपस्तापसः 'the ascetic performed austerity'; अन्वतप्त पापेन कर्मणा 'he repented from evil deeds'.",
    "31066": "A verb is said to denote an action when it is used impersonally; and it is said to denote an object when used in the Passive sense. As अशयि भवता 'it was lain by you i.e. you lay'; अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन; the mat was made by _Devadatta_'. The repetition of चिण् here is for the sake of distinctness.",
    "31067": "In forming Impersonal and Passive verbs, this affix is employed in the conjugational tenses. Thus in Impersonal verbs आस्यते भवता 'you sit', शय्यते भवता 'you lie'. So in passive verbs; as क्रियते कटः and गम्यते ग्रामः. The क of यक् is servile, and prevents _guna_ and _vriddhi_. This affix is also used in reflective voice (कर्म्मकर्त्तरि); as क्रियते कटः स्वयमेव 'the mat becomes made of itself'.",
    "31068": "In active voice, शप् is employed in the conjugational tenses. This affix, which is technically called a विकरण comes after roots of the भू class and after compound roots formed by सन् &c. (III. I. 32). The indicatory श makes it a सार्वधातुक affix by (III. 4. II3), the प् indicates that the vowel has _anudatta_ accent (III. I. 4). As भू + शप् + तिप् = भू + अ + ति = भो + अ + ति = भवति. (VII. 3. 84). So also पचति.",
    "31069": "This debars शप्. The servile न of श्यन् is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 197), showing that the _udatta_ accent falls on the radical verb and not on the affix; and the indicatory श makes the affix _sarvadhatuka_; as दिव् + श्यन् + तिप् = दीव् + य + ति (VII. 2. 77) = दीव्यति; so also सीव्यति. The _Divadi_ verbs belong to the Fourth conjugation.",
    "31070": "Thus भ्राशते or भ्राश्यते 'he shines'; भ्लाशते or भ्लाश्यते 'he shines'; भ्रमति or भ्राम्यति 'he whirls'; क्रामति or क्राम्यति 'he walks'; क्लामति or क्लाम्यति 'he is sad'. So also त्रस्यति or त्रसति; त्रुट्यति or त्रुटति; लष्यति or लषति.",
    "31071": "Thus यास्यति or यसति 'he strives'. But no option is allowed in आयस्यति, प्रयस्यति. The root यस् belongs to the _Divadi_ class.",
    "31072": "Thus संयस्यति or संयसति 'he strives'.",
    "31073": "This debars शप्. As सु + श्नु + तिप् = सु + नु + ति = सुनोति 'he presses out'. These are roots of the Fifth class.",
    "31074": "Thus श्रु + श्नु + तिप् = शृ + नु + ति = शृणोति 'he hears'; शृणुतः: 'they two hear'.",
    "31075": "Thus अक्ष्णोति or अक्षति 'he pervades or obtains'.",
    "31076": "Thus तक्षति or तक्ष्णोति काष्टं 'he hews the wood'. But सन्तक्षति वाग्भिः 'he cuts with speech'.",
    "31077": "This debars शप्. The indicatory श makes this affix a _sarvadhatuka_ affix. As तुद + श + ति = तुद + अ + ति = तुदति (I. 2. 4) 'he pains or torments'.",
    "31078": "This debars शप् The indicatory म् of the affix श्नम् shows that the affix न is to be placed after the last vowel of the root; see _sutra_ (I. 1. 47). As रुध् + श्नम् + ति = रुध् + न + ति = रु + न + ध् + ति = रुणद्धि 'he obstructs'. So also भिनत्ति 'he splits'. The indicatory श is for the sake of _sutra_ (VI. 4. 23).",
    "31079": "This debars शप्. As तन् + उ + ति = तनोति 'he expands'; कृ + उ + ति = करोति 'he makes'. Though the root कृ is included in the list of the _Tanadi_verbs, for which see _Dhatupatha_, yet its separate enunciation in the present _sutra_ is for the sake of making a restrictive rule with regard to this verb; that is to say, the root कृ is a _Tanadi_root only for the purposes of taking the affix उ; all the other operations of _Tanadi_verbs are not to be performed upon it. Thus the rule (II. 4.79.) does not apply to कृ. Thus अकृत and अकृत्याः; the सिच् elision being compulsory and not optional.",
    "31080": "The root धिन्व or धिन्वि belongs to the _Bhuadi_ class. Thus धिन्व + उ + ति = धिन् + अ + उ + ति = धिन् + उ + ति (VI. 4. 48) = धिनोति 'he pleases'. It might be asked, why there is no _guna_ of the इ of धिन् by rule (VII. 3. 86) which requires the base to be _gunated_ before a _sarvadhatuka_ or an _ardhadhatuka_ affix. The answer is to be found in _sutra_ (I. 1. 57); the substitute of अ which is a blank, is like the former occupant (_sthanivat_), and thus prevents _guna_.",
    "31081": "This debars शप्. As क्री + श्ना + तिप् = क्रीणाति 'he buys'. So also प्रीणाति ‘he pleases'.",
    "31082": "As स्तभ्नाति or स्तभ्नोति, स्तुभ्नाति or स्तुभ्नोति, स्कभ्नाति or स्कभ्नोति, स्कुभ्नाति or स्कुभ्नोति, स्कुनाति or स्कुनोति. The first four of these roots are not found in the _Dhatupatha_ and are to be found in the _sutras_, and hence called _Sautra_ roots.",
    "31083": "The affix हि is the 2nd person singular of लोट् or the Imperative mood. Thus पुषाण 'do thou nourish', गृहाण 'do thou take', from roots पुष् and ग्रह which end with consonants. But we have क्रीणीहि 'do thou buy'; here there is no substitution of शानच्, because the root ends with a vowel. The repetition of श्ना in the _sutra_ shows that शानच् is a mere substitute and not an independent affix.",
    "31084": "Thus गृभाय जिह्वया मधु, (_Rig Veda_ VIII. I7. 5). The affix शानच् is also employed; as बधान पशून् 'kill the beasts'.",
    "31085": "The word व्यत्यय means transgression of the fixed rule, or interchange, taking of two _vikaraņas_ at a time, and so on. Thus भेदति  = भिद + शप् + ति) instead of भिनत्ति from the root भिद 'to split', belonging to the _Rudhadi_ class; e.g. शुष्मस्य आण्डानि भेदति (_Rig_. VIII. 40. II.) 'He (_Indra_) break the eggs (children) of _Shushma_; so also, जरसा मरते पतिः (_Rig_. X. 86. II); here there is मरते = (मृ + शप् + ते) instead of म्रियते; the root मृ belonging to the _Tudadi_ class. So also there are two _vikaraņas_ at one and the same time, in the following. इन्द्रो वस्ते न नेषतु 'May _Indra_ lead by this abode' ; here there is नेषतु 3rd. per. sing. of the Imperative लोट् of the root नो 'to lead' ; there are two _vikaraņas_ सिप् and शप् instead of नयतु = (नी +शप् + त्); इन्द्रेण युजा तरुषेम वृत्रम् (_Rig_. VII. 48. I). The word तरुषेम (तृ + उ + सिप् + शप् + अम) is the Ist. per. sing. of the )Optative (लिङ्) of the root तृ, the classical form being तरेम or तीर्याम 'may we cross'.\n\nIn the Vedic literature we have many apparent irregularities with regard to the rules of declension of nouns, conjugation of verbs, application of _Parasmaipada_ or _Atmanepada_ affixes; rules of gender, person or tense, rules of interchange of consonants, or of vowels, rules of accent, rules relating to कृत् and तद्धित affixes and rules relating to the affixes included in the _pratyahara_ यङ् (III. I. 22) to (III. I. 86).",
    "31086": "This debars शप्. The affixes of the Benedictive are _ardhadhatuka_ by (III. 4. 116); but in the _Vedas_ they are _sarvadhatuka_ as well; see Rule (III. 4. 117). The scope of the present rule is confined to the Benedictive of the verbs स्था, गा, गम्, वच्, वद्, शक् and रुह्; as उपस्थेयम्; सत्यमुपगेयम्; गमेम जानतो गृहान्, मन्त्र वोचेमाग्नये, विदेयमेनां मनसि प्रविष्ठां; व्रतम् चरिष्यामि तच्छकेयम्; स्वर्गं लोकमारुहेयम्.\n\nThe affix अक् is employed in the _Chhandas_ after the verb दृश् in the Benedictive. Had there been अङ्, it would have caused _guna_ by rule (VII. 4. 16.); to prevent this, अक् is ordained; as पितरञ्च दृशेयं मातरञ्च 'May I see the father and the mother'.",
    "31087": "This rule applies to reflexive verbs. \"This direction implies the substitution for the operations incident to a tense-affix or ल, denoting an agent, of all the operations, which fall to be performed when the tense-affix or ल denotes the object. Hence there shall be the affixing of यक् (III. I.67) the employment of _Atmanepada_ terminations (I. 3. I3), the substitution of चिण् for च्लि (III. I. 66), and the treatment of the word as directed in _sutra_ (VI. 4. 62).\" (Dr. Ballantyne). Thus भिद्यते काष्ठं स्वयमेव 'the wood splits of itself'; अभेदि काष्ठं स्वयमेव 'the wood splits of itself'.\n\nWhen an action is participated by or affects the agent in the same way as is done by the object, the agent is treated like an object.\n\nWhen in an object, though it stands as an agent, the action is perceived to take place as in an object, then that agent becomes like an object; and all grammatical rules applicable to the object apply to such an agent.\n\nThe word वत् 'like' in the _sutra_ signifies that the rules which apply to an agent also come into operation; thus भिद्यते कुसूलेन.\n\nThe word कर्मणा 'with the object' in the _sutra_ indicates that the _tulyakriya_ or similarity of action must be with the object, and not with the instrument or the location. Thus साध्वसिश्छिनत्ति 'the sword cuts well'; here 'sword' is not agent but instrument. So also साधु स्थाली पचति 'the pot cooks well'; here स्थाली is a location.\n\nThis '_karma-vad-bhava_, the passive-like-construction takes place only in cases of some verbs'.",
    "31088": "Thus तप्यते तपस्तापसः 'the devotee performs austere devotion'; but not so in उत्तपति सुवर्णं सुवर्णकारः 'the goldsmith heats the gold'.",
    "31089": "The affixes यक् and चिण् are used in forming the reflexive verbs, when the action affecting the agent is similar to the action which affects the object. With regard to the root दुह्, the affix यक् is only prohibited by the present _sutra_; the चिण् being optionally employed by rule (III. I. 63), as दुग्धे, अदुग्ध or अदोहि गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow flows or flowed of itself', प्रस्नुते or प्रास्नीष्ट गौः स्वयमेव 'the cow flows or flowed of itself'; नमते or अनंस्त दण्डः स्वयमेव 'the stick bends or bent of itself'.\n\nThis prohibition of the employment of the affixes यक् and चिण् is extended to the verbs that take the affix णि (such as causatives &c.), to the verbs श्रन्थ 'to loosen', मन्थ 'to compose' and ब्रू 'to speak', and to the _Atmanepadi_. Intransitive verbs. As कारयते 'it is caused to be made of itself; अचीकरत् 'it was caused to be made of itself; श्रथ्नीते 'it loosens of itself'; अश्रथ्निष्ट 'it loosened of itself'; मथ्नीते; अमथ्निष्ट 'it composes or composed of itself'; ब्रूते and अवोचत् 'it speaks and spoke of itself'; आहते and आवधिष्ट माणवकः स्वयमेव.",
    "31090": "This debars the affix यक् and the _Atmanepada_ terminations. As कुष्यति पादः स्वयमेव 'the foot draws up of itself'; रज्यति वस्त्रं स्वयमेव 'the cloth colours of itself'.\n\nThe phrase 'in the opinion of the Eastern' shows that it is an optional rule; so that we have also the forms कुष्यते and रज्यते.",
    "31091": "This is an _Adhikara_ _Sutra_. All these verbal affixes are broadly divided into two parts कृत् and कृत्य् affixes, which will be described later on.",
    "31092": "Thus in _sutra_ (III. 2.) कर्म्मण्यन् the word कर्म्मणि is exhibited in the 7th case; therefore the word implied by the word कर्म्मणि, namely, the word having the accusative case, will be called उपपद. Thus कुम्भम् + कृ + अण् = कुम्भकारः 'a potter'; here the word कुम्भम् is an _upapada_.",
    "31093": "Thus the affixes तव्यम् &c. are कृत्. All affixes up to the end of this Book belong to this class. These are affixes by which substantives are formed from verbal roots; and they have, therefore, most aptly been termed primary affixes. Words formed by these affixes will be _Pratipadikas_ or crude forms or nominal bases (I. 2. 46). Thus कृ + तव्यं = कर्तव्यं. Why do we say 'except तिङ् affixes'? Observe चीयात् 'may he collect', स्तुयात् 'may he praise' which form verbs and not nouns.",
    "31094": "Thus the affixes ण्वुल् and तृच् (III. I. I33) are general affixes applicable to all roots in forming nouns of agency; and the _sutra_ (III. I. I33) which ordains these affixes, is an _utsarga_ or a general rule; while the _sutra_ (III. I. I35) ordaining the affix क्र after verbs having a penultimate इक् vowel, and the roots ज्ञा, प्री and कृ is an _apavada_ or a special aphorism. In the latter case, therefore, optionally we may have the affixes ण्वुल् and तृच् also. Thus क्षिप् is a root that has a penultimate इ belonging to the _pratyahara_ इक्; and therefore, in forming the noun of agency from it, the affix क will have to be applied by rule 135 of this chapter already mentioned; thus विक्षिप् + क = विक्षिप् + अ =विक्षिपः; but this special rule however does not debar the operation of the general rule, and we have optionally विक्षिप् + ण्वुल् =विक्षेपकः; an विक्षिप् + तृ =विक्षेप्तृ nom. sing. विक्षेप्ता.\n\nWhy do we say 'not being of the same form'? Because if two affixes have the same form, the present rule will not apply; and in the case of such affixes, the special affix will debar the general affix. Thus the affixes अण् and क are, when stripped of their indicatory letters, affixes having the same form i.e. अ; and therefore the _sutra_ (III. 2. I.) ordaining अण् as a general rule, will be always debarred by _sutra_ (III. 2. 3) ordaining क, as the latter is a special _sutra_ applicable only to those roots which end in long आ, or which are simple roots not compounded with any preposition. Thus गो + दा + क = गोदः 'giver of cows'. So also कम्बलदः 'blanket-giver'. In these cases we cannot have the affix अण्.\n\nIt follows from this _sutra_ as a necessary corollary, that the addition of indicatory letters does not make two or more affixes dissimilar in form (असरूप) when their essential effective element is the same. Thus the affixes क, अण्, अच्, ण् &c. are similar.\n\nWhy do we say 'but not so in the case of feminine affixes'? Because in the case of feminine affixes, a special affix will debar a general affix, though they may be dissimilar in form. Thus _sutra_ (III. 3. 94) ordaining क्तिन् in forming feminine nouns from roots is a general or _utsarga_ rule, while _sutra_ (III. 3. 102) ordaining अ after roots that have already taken some affix is a special or _apavada_ rule, and though अ and ति are dissimilar in form, they being feminine affixes, the former will always debar the latter. Thus the compound desiderative roots चिकीर्ष and जिहीर्ष will form feminine nouns in आ and not by क्तिन्. Thus चिकीर्षा and जिहीर्षा and not चिकीर्षति &c.",
    "31095": "This defines the class of affixes known as _kritya_, a subdivision of _krit_ affixes. These are certain affixes like तव्य, अनीय &c, which may be treated as declinable verbal terminations. (III. 4. 70). The following 38 _sutras_ treat of these affixes. These verbal adjectives correspond in meaning to the Latin participles in _udus_ conveying the idea that the action expressed by the verbs ought to be done or will be done. The word formed by them may be called Passive Potential Participles or Future Passive Participles. The illustrations will be given hereafter under each affix as taught. The word _kritya_ occurs in _sutras_ (II. I. 33), (II. 3. 71) &c.",
    "31096": "The phrase 'after verbal roots' is understood in this aphorism by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ 91. The final letters त् of तव्यत् and र् of अनीयर् are for the sake of indicating accent, being merely diacritical letters. The letter त् indicating _svarita_ accent (VI. I. I85) and the letter र indicating penultimate _udatta_ accent (VI. I. 217); these being exceptions to the general rule of accent given in _sutra_ 3 _ante_ of this chapter.\n\nThus कृ + तव्यत् = कर्तव्यम्, and कृ + तव्य = कर्तव्यम् 'must be done'; कृ + अनीयर् = करणीयम् 'must be done'. In these cases the sense being that of the action itself, there is neuter gender singular number.\n\nVart:- The affix तव्यत् when coming after the verb वस् 'to dwell' in marking the agent, is treated as if it had an indicatory ण. The force of ण् is to cause _vriddhi_. Thus वस् + तव्यत् =वास्तव्यः 'a dweller'. Here the word is in the masculine gender, as the force of the affix is that of the agent, and not as it generally has that of an act or object (III. 4. 70).\n\nVart:- The affix केलिमर् should be enumerated in addition to those already enumerated in this aphorism. Thus पचेलिमा माषाः 'kidney beans fit to be\ncooked'; भिदेलिमानि काष्ठानि 'the woods are apt to be split i. e: 'fragile'. This affix is to be employed when it is intended to express an object alone (i. e. in the passive and reflexive sense) and cannot be employed like those enumerated above, to denote also the action.",
    "31097": "The letter त् of this affix is indicatory showing that the _udatta_ accent falls on the first vowel (VI. I. 213); thus गा + यत् = गेय, noun sing. गेयम् 'what is to be sung'; so also पेयम् 'what is to be drunk'; जेयम् 'what is to be conquered'. The आ of गा and पा is changed into ए by (VI. 4. 65). Why do we say 'that ends in a vowel'? By _sutra_ 124 of this chapter, a root ending in a consonant takes ण्यत् affix instead of यत्; reading these two aphorisms together, the conclusion to be drawn is that the affix यत् comes after roots which primarily end in a vowel, though in the course of development they may end in a consonant by the application of other rules. Thus from दो 'to cut', we have the desiderative root दित्स, which ends in a vowel अ. This अ is elided before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes and thus the root becomes दित्स्, which ends in a consonant; nevertheless we shall have the affix यत् and not ण्यत्. Thus दित्स्यम् 'what is wished to be cut'; धित्स्यम् 'what is wished to be placed'. Similarly लु before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes becomes लो, the ओ is changed into अव् before य (VI. I. 79) and the form then is लव्. The root लव् however takes यत् and not ण्यत्; as लव्यो, पव्यम्, &c.\n\nVart:- The verbs तक् 'to fly', शच् 'to leap', चत् 'to ask', यत् 'to attempt' and जन् 'to be born', should be enumerated in addition; that is to say, these verbs, though ending in a consonant, take यत् and not ण्यत्; as तक्यम्, शस्यम्, चत्यम्, यत्यम्, and जन्यम्.\n\nVart:-Ånd of the verb हन् 'to kill' वध is the substitute when it optionally takes the affix यत्. Thus we have वध्यम् or घात्यम्. The latter form is evolved by _sutras_ (VII. 3. 32 and 54). The affix यत् comes only after the वध् substitute; after हन् the affix ण्यत् comes which changes the ह into घ, and न into त and causes _vriddhi_.",
    "31098": "This debars ण्यत्; thus शप् + यत् =शप्यं 'to be sworn'; लभ् + यत् = लभ्यम् 'to be acquired'.\n\nWhy do we say 'which ends in a labial'? Because if a root ends in any other consonant, though preceded by a short अ, the root will take ण्यत्; thus पच् + ण्यत् = पाक्यम् 'what is to be cooked'; वाक्यम् 'speech'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when preceded by a short अ'? When preceded by any other vowel, it will take ण्यत्; thus कुप् + ण्यत् = कोप्यम् 'to be angry'; so also गोप्यम् 'to be concealed'.\n\nThe word अत् is used in the _sutra_ in the original. The force of त् here is, by (I. I. 70), that short अ having one _matra_ or prosodial length is to be taken and not long आ. Therefore, after the root आप् 'to obtain', we have ण्यत् and not यत्; thus आप्यम् 'to be reached' i. e. 'attainable'.",
    "31099": "Thus शक्यम् 'possible'; सह्यम् 'endurable'.",
    "31100": "Thus गद्यम् 'what is to be spoken, i.e prose'; मद्यम् 'wine'; चर्यम् 'what is to be followed'; यम्यम् 'what is to be restrained'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not preceded by a preposition'? When compounded with an _upasarga_, these roots will take ण्यत्; thus प्रगाद्यम्; प्रमाद्यम् &c.\n\nThe root यम् would have taken the affix यत् by _sutra_ 98 also, as it ends in म and is preceded by अ; its separate enumeration in this _sutra_ is in order to show, that the compound verb यम् will not take the affix यत्. Therefore with regard to यम्, this is a _niyama_ or restrictive rule and not a _vidhi_ or original rule.\n\nVart:- The root चर when preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the यत्, affix when the sense is not that of a preceptor; thus आचर्यो देशः 'an approachable or communicable country'. But when the sense is that of a teacher the root takes ण्यत्; thus आचार्यः 'a preceptor'",
    "31101": "Thus, अवद्यं पापं 'censurable sin'. Another and regular form is अनुद्यम्. This is formed by adding the affix क्यप् to the root वद् by (III. I. 106). So also पण्यः कम्बलः 'saleable blanket'; पण्याः गौः 'saleable cow'. The other and regular form is पाण्यम्, formed by the addition of ण्यत्. So also शतेन वर्या 'unobstructed by hundred'; सहस्रेण वर्या 'unobstructed by thousand'. The other and regular form is वृत्या from the root वृ 'to choose'. वर्या means a girl choosing her own husband and is non-obstructable by any body. The word वर्या in the _sutra_ is in the feminine gender, and it is in this gender only that the word is so formed. In the masculine gender, the word is regularly formed; thus वार्या ऋत्विजः.",
    "31102": "The word वह्य is derived from root वह 'to carry' and means 'a vehicle', i. e., that by which a thing is carried; as वह्यं शकटम्. When it does not mean a carriage, the root takes the affix ण्यत्; thus वाह्यः 'an ox'.",
    "31103": "The word अर्य is irregularly formed when meaning 'lord' and a '_Vaisya_'.\nThe root ऋ 'to go', would have taken ण्यत् by _sutra_ 124 of this chapter; but it takes यत् when the sense of the word formed by it is that of a 'lord' or a man of '_Vaisya_' caste. As अर्यः स्वामी, 'honored lord', अर्ये वैश्यः 'honored _Vaisya_'.\n\nVart: Though by (VI. I. 213), the affix यत् makes the _udatta_ accent fall on the first syllable of the word, yet in the case of the word अर्य, when it means 'lord', the accent falls on the last syllable.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it means a lord or a _Vaisya_'? Otherwise the root takes the affix ण्यत्; as आर्यो ब्राह्मणः 'the respectable _Brahmana_'.",
    "31104": "The word उपसर्या is formed by adding यत् affix to the root सृ 'to move', compounded with the preposition उप. The word काल्या means having reached the time. The word प्रजन means the first conception. Thus उपसर्या गौः 'the cow fit for the bull'; उपसर्या वडवा 'the mare fit for the horse'. \nWhy do we say 'when meaning what has reached the time favorable to conception'? Otherwise the affix ण्यत् will be used; as उपसर्या शरदि मधुरा '_Madhura_ is approachable in _Sarat_ season'.",
    "31105": "The word अजर्यम् is formed from the root जृ by the addition of यत्, and affixing the negative particle अ; as अ + जृ + यत् = अजर्यं.\n\nThus अजर्यं नोऽस्तु सङ्गतम् 'let our friendship be imperishable'. So also अजर्यमार्यसङ्गतम्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when qualifying the word सङ्गतम्'? Observe अजरिता कम्बलः 'undecaying blanket'.",
    "31106": "The phrase 'not having a preposition' is to be read into this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_100 _ante_. The force of the word 'also' is to indicate that the affix यत् is also employed. The word सुपि means 'in construction with an _upapada_ that ends in case-affix'.\n\nThus ब्रह्म + वद् + क्यप् = ब्रह्म + वद् + य = ब्रह्मोद्य; ब्रह्म + वद् + यत् = ब्रह्मवद्यम् 'told by the _Vedas_ or _Brahman_'. Similarly सत्योद्यम् or सत्यवद्यम् 'truth-mouthed'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it has a case-inflected word as _upapada_'? Otherwise वद् + ण्यत् = वाद्यम् 'a musical instrument'.\n\nWhy do we say 'not having a preposition'? Observe प्रवाद्यम् ' a rumour' formed by the affix ण्यत् and not by यत् or क्यप्.",
    "31107": "The words सुपि and अनुपसर्गे of previous _sutras_ are understood in this. The _anuvritti_ of यत् does not cover this aphorism. As ब्रह्मभुवं गतः = ब्रह्मत्वं गतः 'gone to or arrived at _Brahma_hood'; देवभुवं = देवत्वं गतः 'gone to divinity'.\n\nThe word _bhava_ of this _sutra_ governs the succeeding ones.\n\nWhy do we say 'in construction with a case-inflected word'? Otherwise it will take यत्; as भू + यत् = भो + यत् = भव्यम् (VI. I.79).\n\nWhy do we say 'not taking a preposition'? Observe प्रभव्यम् ।",
    "31108": "The phrases सुपि अनुपसर्गे and भावे are understood in this _sutra_.\n\nAs ब्रह्म + हन् + क्यप् = ब्रह्म + हत् + य = ब्रह्महत्य, (VI. I. 71) ब्रह्महत्या '_Brahman_- murder'. So also अश्वहत्या 'killing a horse'.\n\nWhen not in construction with a noun, the form is घातः 'a blow' (हन् + णिच् +घञ्). This verb does not take the affix ण्यत् in denoting condition, there being no example of such formation.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not taking a preposition'? Observe प्रघातो वर्तते 'there is a combat'.",
    "31109": "The _anuvritti_ of सुपि, अनुपसर्गे and भावे does not extend to this aphorism. The present _sutra_ ordains generally the affix व्यप् after the above verbs. Thus इ + क्यप् = इ + त + य (VI. I. 71) = इत्यः 'to be gone'. The letter त being added by Rule (VI. I. 71) which declares 'त is the augment of a short vowel when a कृत् affix, with an indicatory प् follows'. So also स्तु + क्यप् = स्तुत्यः 'to be praised'; शास् + क्यप् = शिस् + य (आ being changed into इ by (VI. 4. 34)) = शिष्यः 'to be instructed i.e. a pupil'. So also वृ + क्यप् = वृत्यः 'to be chosen'; आदृ + क्यप् = आदृत्यः 'to be honoured'; जुष् + क्यप् = जुष्यः 'to be served'.\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of क्यप् was coming from the previous _sutra_ 100, its repetition in this aphorism is to indicate that other rules such as 125 of this chapter should not take effect in the above verbs. Thus Rule 125 requires ण्यत् 'after the verb स्तु, but the present rule prohibits that. Thus we have अवश्य स्तुत्यः 'must be praised'.\n\nBy वृ in the _sutra_ the root वृञ् is intended to be taken, and not the root वृङ्. The equivalent derivative of the latter is वार्यः as वार्या ऋत्विजः.\n\nVart:- The roots शस् 'to praise' दुह् 'to milk' and गुह् 'to cover' optionally take the affix क्यप्. As शस्यम् or शंस्यम् (VI. 4. 37); दुह्यम् or दोह्यम्, गुह्यम् or गोह्यम्.\n\nVart:- The verb अञ्ज् 'to anoint', preceded by the preposition आङ् takes the affix क्यप् when used as an appellative. As आ + अञ्ज् + क्यप् = आज्यम् meaning clarified butter. The nasal is elided by (VI. 4. 24).\n\nObj.- How do you explain the form उपेयम् which is evidently formed from the root इ by adding यत् ? According to the present _sutra_, the affix\nक्यप् ought to have been added. Ans. The इ in उपेयम् is a different root from that taken here. The root in this _sutra_ is इण् of the _Adadi_ class.",
    "31110": "Thus वृत् + क्यप् = वृत्यम्; so also वृध्यम्. But क्लृप् and चृत् will form कल्प्यम्, and चर्त्यम्.\n\nWhy have we used the letter त् in ऋत् ? It is to indicate that short ऋ\nis meant and not long ॠ (I. I. 70). Therefore the root कॄत् will take ण्यत् and form कीर्त्यम्.\n\nVart:- The root सृज् takes the affix ण्यत् when compounded with the word पाणि. Thus पाणिसर्ग्या रज्जुः 'a rope'.\n\nVart:- The root सृज् when preceded by both सम् and अव takes ण्यत् as समवसर्ग्या.",
    "31111": "Thus खन् + क्यप् = ख + ई + य = खेयम् 'to be dug'. The long ई is used in the _sutra_ for the sake of euphony. The same purpose would have been served by using short इ, thus 'इ च खनः'. But the long ई indicates that the rule (VI. 4. 43) does not apply here. By that rule the अ of खन् would have been lengthened into आ before the affix क्यप्.",
    "31112": "Thus भृ + क्यप् = भृत्य Pl. भृत्याः 'those who ought to be supported' i. e. 'servants'. Why do we say 'when not used as an appellative'? Observe क्षृ + ण्यत् = क्षार्थः 'a _Kshatriya_'.\n\nVart:- The use of _kyap_ is optional when this verb takes the preposition सम्. Thus सम्भृत्याः or सम्भार्याः.",
    "31113": "This is an example of _Prapta-vibhasha_. By rule 110 ante, the root मृज् having a penultimate ऋ would have necessarily taken _kyap_; this _sutra_ declares an option. As परिमृज्यः or परिमार्ग्यः 'to be cleansed'. The second form is thus evolved:-\n\nपरिमृज्य + ण्यत् (III. I. 124) = परिमृग् + य (VII. 3. 52) = परिमार्ग्य (VII. 2. 114)",
    "31114": "Thus राज्ञा सोतव्यः or राज्ञा इह सूयते, राज + सू + क्यप् = राजसूयः 'the _Rajasuya_ or coronation sacrifice'.\n\nSimilarly सृ or सू + क्यप् = सूर्यः 'the sun', literally that which moves (सरति) in the sky; or that which impels (सुवति) creation to action. मृष +वद +क्यप् = मृषोद्यम् 'false speech'; this is an exception to rule 106, by which यत् would also have been applied This rule prevents it. Thus रोचतेऽसौ, रुच् + क्यप् = रुच्य. 'an agreeable lover'. So also गुप् + क्यप् = कुप्यम् 'a base metal (other than gold and silver)'; the other form is गोप्यम् । कृष्ट + पच् = कृष्टपच्याः 'that which ripens of itself in cultivated ground'. न व्यथते = अव्यथ्यः 'a snake (what does not move by legs)'.",
    "31115": "Thus भिद् + क्यप् = भिद्यः 'a river that breaks its banks by the rush of its water', the name of the _Bhidya_ river.\n\nऊज्झ् + क्यप् = उद्ध्य 'a river whose waters overflow the banks', name of the _Uddhya_ river; the झ is changed into ध.\n\nWhen not meaning or qualifying the river, the regular forms are used; thus भेत्ता and उज्झिता.",
    "31116": "Thus पुष् + क्यप् = पुष्यः 'the _Pushya_ asterism'. It is so called because objects are nourished under the influences of this asterism. सिध् + क्यप् = सिद्ध्यः 'the asterism _Siddhya_' another name of _Pushya_, so-called because things are accomplished under the influence of this star.\n\nWhen not the names of asterisms, the forms are पोषणं 'nourishing', सेधनम् 'accomplishing'.",
    "31117": "Thus वि + पू + क्यप् = विपूयः etymologically 'that which has to be purified to make rope'; वि + नी + क्यप् =विनीय 'a sediment or sin'; जि + क्यप् = जित्य 'a plough that which is to be conquered by strength'.\n\nThe regular derivatives are विपाव्यम्, विनेयम् and जेयम्.",
    "31118": "Thus मत्तस्य न प्रतिग्राह्यम् तस्मान्नापिगृह्यम् ॥\n\nIn the classical Sanskrit the proper forms are प्रतिगृह्यम् and अपिग्राह्यम्.",
    "31119": "Thus प्रगृह्यम् 'the _Pragrihya_ words that do not admit of _sandhi_, already defined in _sutra_ (I. I. II). So also अवगृह्यं.\n\nThe word अस्वैरि means dependent upon others, not free to provide for himself. Thus गृह्यकाः शुकाः 'the captive parrots'.\n\nThe word बाह्य means 'situated outside'. Thus ग्रामगृह्या सेना 'an army lying outside the village'. The word बाह्या being in the feminine gender indicates that the derivative word formed from ग्रह must also be feminine in gender to have this sense.\n\nThe word पक्ष्य is derived from पक्ष 'a side, a party', and means a partisan, follower or friend. Thus वासुदेवगृह्याः 'siding with or being the partisans of _Vasudeva_'. So also अर्जुनगृह्याः 'belonging to the party of _Arjun_'.",
    "31120": "The root कृ would have taken the affix ण्यत्, by 124, and the verb वृष् would necessarily have taken क्यप् by 110; the present _sutra_ therefore declares an optional rule. Thus: कृ + क्यप् = कृत्यम् 'to be done'; or कृ + ण्यत् = कार्यम्. So also वृष्यम् or वर्ष्यम् 'stimulating'.",
    "31121": "The word पत्र means that by which a thing is carried. Thus युग्यो गौ 'the carrier bull or the yoked bull'. युग्यो हस्ती 'the harnessed elephant ready to carry'. युज् + क्यप् = युग्यम्. The ज is changed into ग. When not meaning a carrier or a carriage, it has the form योग्यं.",
    "31122": "The word अमा means 'along' or 'together'. अमा in composition with the root वस् 'to dwell', takes the affix ण्यत् in the sense of location of time. Optionally the _Vriddhi_ is not substituted in such a case. The time or the day on which the sun and the moon dwell together in the same constellation is called अमावास्या or अमावस्या.\n\nThe final त in अमावस्यत् is indicatory and is for the sake of showing where should the proper accent fall.\n\nThe two forms अमावस्या or अमावास्या are the same word, and a fortiori a rule made with regard to one will be made applicable to the other. And to this effect there is a _paribhasha_ which declares एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वम् ; 'that which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place'. Therefore _sutra_(IV. 3. 30), though it, in terms, says अमावास्याया वा is made applicable to the form अमावस्या also.",
    "31123": "The formation of the above words are extremely irregular and they are all met with in the Vedic literature only. Thus the word निष्टर्क्य is derived from the root कृत् 'to cut', with the preposition निस्, and the affix ण्यत्, instead of क्यप् which is the regular affix, by 110; निः + कृत् + ण्वत् = निः + तृक् + य (the root कृत् transformed into तृक् by transposition) = निष्टर्क्य. As निष्टर्क्ये चिन्वीत् पशुकामः.\n\nThe above is apparently a guess-work etymology of grammarians.\n\nSo also देवहूय is formed by adding to the root हूयते 'to call' or हू 'to invoke', the affix क्यप् and the _upapada_ देव; the vowel of the root is then lengthened and the augment त (VI. I.71), is not allowed, देव + है or हू + क्यप् = देवहूयः So also प्र + नी (to lead) + क्यप् = प्रणीयः; उत् + नी + क्यप् = उन्नीयः, उत् + शिष् (to leave) + क्यप् = उच्छिष्यम्; मृ (to die) + यत् = मर्यः; स्तृ (to cover) + यत् = स्तर्या; it is always feminine. ध्वृ (to bend) + यत् = ध्वर्यः; खन् (to dig) + यत् = खन्यः; खन् + ण्यत् = खान्यः; देव (God) + यज् (to sacrifice) + यत् = देवयज्या; always used as feminine. आ + पृच्छ् (to ask) + क्यप् = आपृच्छ्यः, प्रति + सीव (to sew) + क्यप् = प्रतिषीव्यः; ब्रह्मण् + वद् (to speak) + ण्यत् = ब्रह्मवाद्यः; भू (to be) + ण्यत् = भाव्यः; स्तु (to praise) + ण्यत् = स्ताव्यः; उप + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् + पृडं = उपचाय्यपृडम्. This last word is formed then only when the word पृड follows: and when the sense is that of 'gold'. When it does not mean 'gold', the form is उपचेयपृडम् ।",
    "31124": "The phrase ॠहलोः is in the genitive case dual number, the force of genitive here being that of ablative. As कृ + ण्यत् = कार्यम् 'to be made'; हृ + ण्यत् = हार्य nom. sing. हार्यम् 'to be taken'; धृ + ण्यत् = धार्यं; 'to be held'; वच् + ण्यत् = वक् + ण्यत् (VII. 3. 52) = वाक्यं (VII. 2. II6) 'to be spoken'; पच् + ण्यत् = पाक्यम्.",
    "31125": "This debars the affix यत्. Thus लु + ण्यत् = लौ + य = लाव्यं (VII. 2. 115) and (VI. I. 79) 'must be cut'; so also पु + ण्यत् = पाव्यम् 'must be purified'.\n\nWhen 'necessity' is not indicated we have the form लव्यं 'to be cut' The _sutra_ as given in the original is rather ambiguous; it may be construed to mean, 1st when the word आवश्यक or a word having the sense of this term is in construction as _upapada_, the affix ण्यत् is employed : or 2ndly when, the sense of the affix is that of 'necessity', the ण्यत् is employed. There are objections to both these interpretations taken separately. For in the first case, though we could form the words अवश्यलाव्यं &c., we could not form the word लाव्य by itself. In the second case, though we could form the single word लाव्यं, we could not form the compound. The best solution is to take the second interpretation and form the compound by the universal rule of _Tatpurusha_ contained in (II. I. 72), which would also regulate the accent.",
    "31126": "The verb आसु is a compound verb formed by the preposition आङ् and the root सु. This _sutra_ debars यत् that would otherwise have come by _sutra_ 97 and 98.\n\nThus आसु + ण्यत् = आसाव्यम्, (VII. 2. II5) and (VI. I. 79); so also याव्यम्, वाप्यम्, राप्यम्, लाप्यम्, त्राप्यम् and आचाम्यम्.\n\nThe force of the word च 'and' in the _sutra_ is to indicate that the roots not included in the above enumeration should also be taken. Thus दभ् + ण्यत् = दाभ्यम् ॥",
    "31127": "This word is thus formed:- आङ् + नी + ण्यत् = आ + नै + य = आनाय्य, (the ऐ being changed into आय् by the analogy of (VI. I. 79)).\n\nAs आनाय्यो दक्षिणाग्निः. This is a species of _Dakshiņagni_ fire. As this fire is brought from the _Garhapatya_ fire and is not permanently kept alive, therefore it is called _anayya_. This however, is not co-extensive with _Dakshiņagni_. It is that fire which is brought from the _Garhapatya_, and has the same source with the _Dakshiņagni_ and _Ahavaniyagni_. A _Dakshinagni_ fire may be taken from different sources, as from the family of a well-to-do _Vaishya_, or from a frying place, or from _Garhapatya_ fire. When it is taken from the last i. e. from _Garhapatya_ fire, it is _anayya_ _Dakshiņagni_. _Ahavaniya_ is also taken from _Garhapatya_.\n\nIt is not everything, that is not lasting, which is called _anayya_ ; for a fragile pot will not be called so. It applies only to the consecrated fire. When it has not this sense, the form is आनेय meaning 'what ought to be brought'.",
    "31128": "The word असम्मति is a negative word meaning 'non-agreement'. It means also 'disrespect'.\n\nThus प्रणाय्यश्चोरः 'the thief is to be disliked'.\n\nWhy do we say when meaning 'disapproved'. Because otherwise the regular form is प्र + नी 'to lead' + यत् = प्रणेयः 'tractable'.\n\nThe word in the _sutra_ is असम्मति which we have translated as 'disapproved'. But the word सम्मति also means अभिलाष or 'desire'; and असम्मति would therefore, mean 'free from desire or worldly attachment'. Therefore the word असम्मति means also 'free from attachment', as in the following sentence:-\n\nज्येष्ठाय पुत्राय पिता ब्रह्म प्रभ्रूयात्, प्रणाय्याय अन्तेवासिने नान्यस्मै कस्मैचन  'let the father teach the Secret Doctrine to his eldest son, or to such pupil who is free from worldly attachment, and to no one else'.",
    "31129": "These words are supposed to be formed thus:- मा (to measure) + ण्यत् = पाय्यम्, the म being changed into प and another य being added by (VII. 3. 33). The regular form is मेयम् 'to be measured' (मा + ण्यत् = मे + य (VI. 4. 65) = मेय). सम् + नी (to lead) + ण्यत् = सान्नाय्यम् 'the oblation'. It being a crude form applies to a particular kind of oblation. The regular form is सन्नेयम् । नि + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् = नि + चै + य = नि + चाय + य = निकाय्यः 'a dwelling'. The regular form is निचेय । धा (to put) + ण्यत् = धाय्या (fem.). The _samadheni_ is the name of certain _Rik_ hymns used as supplemental verses in a Litany. The other form is धेय ।",
    "31130": "These words are thus formed: कुण्ड + पा (to drink) + यत् = कुण्ड + पा + य + य (VII. 3. 33) = कुण्डपाय्यः 'the sacrifice in which _Soma_ is drunk with a bowl'. The accent falls on the first syllable by (VI. I. 213). सम् + चि (to collect) + ण्यत् = सञ्चाय्यः 'the sacrifice in which _Soma_ is collected'.\n\nIf not applied to sacrifices, the forms will be कुण्डपानम् and सञ्चेयः.",
    "31131": "These words are thus formed:- परि + चि +ण्यत् = परि + चै + य = परि + चाय + य = परिचाय्यः 'sacrificial fire arranged in a circle' (the ऐ being changed into आय् by the analogy of (VI. I. 79). This peculiar sandhi before the semivowel य has been illustrated in the previous examples also). So also उपचाय्यः 'a kind of Sacred fire'. सम् + वह + ण्यत् = सम् + ऊह् + य = समूह्यः 'a kind of fire'. समूह्यं चिन्वीत पशुकामः 'let him kindle the _Samuhya_ fire desirous of a victim'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when they are names of fire'? Observe otherwise, परिचेयम् 'to be heaped', उपचेयम् 'to be increased', संवाह्यम् 'to be carried'.",
    "31132": "The word चित्यः comes from the root चि 'to collect', and means fire i. e. that which is collected. As चित्योऽग्निः 'the funeral pile fire'. The word अग्निचित्या means, arranging the fire. The affix य has been added to denote condition, together with the augment तुक् (त्). These words have _udatta_ accent on the last vowel. The regular form is चेयम् 'to be gathered'.",
    "31133": "The word 'root' is understood in the above aphorism. Thus कृ 'to do' + ण्वुल्  = कार + यु (VII. 2. II5) = कार + अक (VII. I. I) = कारक nom. sing. कारकः 'doer.' कृ + तृच् = कर् + तृ (VII. 3. 84) = कर्तृ nom. sing. कर्ता. So also हारकः and हर्ता.\n\nThe च् of तृच् is not indicatory, but distinguishes this affix from तृन्; the simple तृ includes both तृच् and तृन्, as in (V. 3. 59), and (VI. 4. I54).",
    "31134": "The word _adi_ meaning etcetra, is to be joined with every one of the above three words. These three affixes come respectively after the verbs of the above three classes. Thus after the verbs of नन्द class, comes the affix ल्यु; after the verbs of ग्रह class, comes the affix णिनि; after the verbs of पच् class, comes the affix अच्.\n\nThe नन्दादि verbs will not be found in one place in the _Dhatupatha_. The list of the words formed by these affixes have, however, been collected in the _Ganapatha_. Thus नन्द् + ल्यु = नन्द् + यु (I 3. 8) = नन्द् + अन (VI. I. I) = नन्दन nom. sing. नन्दनः 'son' (lit. what gladdens). So also from the following causative roots, nouns are formed, meaning names :- वासि - वासनः or वाशनः; मदि - मदनः; दूषि - दूषणः (or भूषणः); साधि - साधनः; वर्धि - वर्धनः; शोभि - शोभनः and रोचि - रोचनः.\n\nThe following derivatives are names :- सहि - सहनः; तपि - तपनः; दमि – दमनः\n\nSo also the following words :- जल्पनः, रमणः, दर्पणः, सङ्क्रन्दनः, सङ्कर्षणः, संहर्षणः, जनार्दनः, यवनः, पवनः, मधुसूदनः, विभीषणः, लवणः (the ण in लवण is irregular), चित्तविनाशनः, कुलदमनः and शत्रुदमनः.\n\nThe ग्रहादि verbs are also nowhere enumerated in a group. The following are, however, those verbs :- ग्रह् - ग्रहिन् nom. ग्राही; उत्सह - उत्साहिन् nom. उत्साही; उद्दस् - उद्दासिन्; उद्भास् - उद्भासिन्; स्था - स्थायिन्; मन्त्र - मन्त्रिन्; सम्मर्द – सम्मर्दिन्. So also the verbs - रक्ष, श्रु, वस्, वप् and शा preceded by नि; as, निरक्षिन्, निश्राविन्, निवासिन्, निवापिन्, निशायिन्. The verbs याचि, व्याहृ, संव्याहृ, व्रज, वद and वस take णिन् when preceded by the negative particle; as, अयाचिन्, अव्याहारिन्, असंव्याहारिन्, अव्राजिन्, अवादिन् and अवासिन्. So also after verbs ending in a vowel when agents are non-conscious beings : as, अकारिन्, अहारिन्. So also, अविनायिन्, अविशायिन्, विशयिन्, विषयिन् (meaning a place) विशायिन् and विषायिन्, अभिभाविन् अपराधिम्, उपरोधिन्, परिभविन् and परिभाविन् ।\n\nThe following are पचादि words :- पच, वच, वप, वद, चल, तप, पत नदट्, भषट्, वस् गरत् प्लवट्, तरट्, चीरट्, माहट्, जर, मर, क्षर, क्षम, सूदट्, देवट्, मोरट् सेव, मेष, क्रोध, व्रण, दंश, दश, दम्भ, जारभर, श्वपच, मेघ, कीष, क्षप, मद, रज, दीषट्, चरट् ।\n\nThe ट् in नदट् &c., shows that the feminine of these is formed by long ई (IV. I. 15). The पचादि class is an आकृतिगणः ।\n\nअज्विधिः सर्वधातुभ्यः पठ्यन्ते च पचादयः ।\nअण् बाधनार्थमेवं स्यात् सिध्यन्ति श्वपचादयः ॥\n\nIn fact the affix अच् comes after all verbs, and is not exclusively confined to the verbs above enumerated. The affix अव्, therefore, debars अण् and may be taken to be the universal affix, and by its help the forms like\nश्वपच &c. may be explained.",
    "31135": "Thus विक्षिप् + क = विक्षिप nom. sing. विक्षिपः. So also विलिखः 'inscription'; बुधः 'who knows', कृशः 'lean'; ज्ञा + क = ज्ञः 'who knows' (VI. 4. 64); प्री + क = प्रियः 'what pleases'; कॄ + क = कि + अ ( VII. I. 100) = किर् + अ (I. I. 51) = किरः 'who scatters' i. e. 'a hog'.\n\nThe words देव 'God', सेव 'service' and मेष 'ram', should be read in the पचादि class of the last _sutra_, being formed by the affix अच् and not by क.",
    "31136": "This is an _apavada_ of  (III. I. 40), and debars the affix ण. Thus प्रस्था + क = प्रस्थ + अ = प्रस्थः (VI. 4. 64). सुग्लै + क = सुग्ल + अ = सुग्लः 'very weary' (आ substituted for ऐ by (VI. I. 45.)) सुम्लै + क = सुम्ला + अ = सुम्लः 'very languid'.\n\nThe final आ is dropped before the affix क by rule (VI. 4. 64). There is elision of long आ when an _ardhadhatuka_ affix follows beginning with a vowel and having an indicatory क or ङ.",
    "31137": "Thus उत् + पा + शा = उत् + पिब् + अ (VII. 3. 78) = उत्पिब nom. sing. उत्पिबः; so also विपिबः; उज्जिघ्रः and विजिघ्रः । उत् + ध्मा + श = उत् + धम्+ अ = (VII. 3. 78); उद्धमः; विधमः; उत् + धे + श = उद्धयः; विधयः; so also उत् + दृश् + शा = उत्पश्यः, (VII. 3. 78). so also विपश्यः;\n\nSome commentators do not read the word '_upasarga_' into this _sutra_. According to them the forms like पश्यः &c., can be formed also.\n\nThe affix श, of which श् is indicatory, the real affix being अ, causes the root to undergo all those changes, which it undergoes in special tenses; for it is a _sarvadhatuka_ affix there; see _sutra_ (III. 4. 113) and (VII. 3. 78).\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the root घ्रा, when the word to be formed is a name. As वि + आ + घ्रा + क = व्याघ्रः 'tiger' (an animal that goes about smelling). Here there is क and not the affix श.",
    "31138": "Thus लिम्पः 'smearing'; विन्दः 'acquiring'; धारयः 'holding' पारयः 'ferrying; वेदयः 'knowing'; उपेजयः 'shaking'; चेतयः 'perceiving'; सातयः, and साहयः.\n\nWhy do we say 'when used without a preposition'? Observe प्रलिपः; here the affix is क.\n\nVart:- The verb लिप् with the preposition नि takes the affix श. As निलिम्पा 'the name of certain deities', 'a cow'.\n\nVart:- The affix श is employed after विन्द when compounded with the words गो &c. and when the word to be formed is a proper noun. As गोविन्दः '_Krishna_' (protector of cows); अरविन्दः 'a lotus' (having petals like spokes).",
    "31139": "This debars ण. Thus ददः 'giving'; or दायः 'inheritance'; दधः 'holding' or धायः 'having'.\n\nWhen a preposition is used, the affix श is not employed; as प्रदः, प्रधः.",
    "31140": "The word इति in ज्वलति indicates beginning. These are about 56 verbs, all belonging to the _Bhvadi_ class. See No. 804 to 860 in the _Dhatupatha_, Bombay Edition in the Appendix to _Sidhanta Kaumudi_.\n\nThis debars the affix अच्; as ज्वालः or ज्वलः; चालः or चलः.\n\nThe affix ण (अ) having an indicatory ण्, causes the _vriddhi_ of the penultimate अ. When the affix ण is not used, then अच् is used and we have the other form. But compound verbs take अच्; as प्रज्वलः 'luminous'.\n\nVart:- The verb तन 'to stretch' must be included in this list, and it takes the affix ण; as अवतान. The conditions 'option' and 'without preposition' do not apply in this case. The verb तन् necessarily takes this affix, though compounded with an _upasarga_.",
    "31141": "The root श्यै, before affixes, becomes श्या, (VI. I. 45) and is thus included in the phrase 'verbs ending in long आ'. What is then the use of its separate enumeration? The separate enumeration is for the sake of excluding the application of every other rule which might have prohibited ण. Thus (III. I. 136) enjoins क when a compound verb ends in अ. But that rule does not apply to the verb श्या.\n\nThus अवश्यायः 'frost', प्रतिश्यायः 'catarrh', दायः 'inheritance', धायः 'having', व्याधः 'pain', आस्रावः 'wound', संस्रावः 'flow', अत्यायः 'transgression', अवसायः 'conclusion', अवहारः 'taken away', लेहः 'licking', श्लेषः 'embracing', श्वासः 'breath'. See (VII. 3. 33).",
    "31142": "Thus दु + ण = दौ + अ (VII. 2. 115) = दावः (VI. 1. 78) 'burning'. So also नी + ण = नी + अ = नायः 'leading'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when used without a preposition'? Observe प्रदयः 'burning'; प्रणयः 'friendship'.",
    "31143": "This debars the affix अच्. Thus ग्रह् + ण = ग्रह् + अ (VII. 2. 116) = ग्राहः 'seizing', 'a crocodile'; or ग्रह + अच् =ग्रहः 'a planet'.\n\nThe option allowed by this aphorism is a _vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_ or definite option, that is to say, the affix ण is always used when the word to be formed means a water-animal, such as a crocodile, shark &c., and in that sense the word is ग्राह. But not so, when heavenly luminaries are meant; there the word is ग्रह.\n\nVart:- This rule should be extended to the root भू 'to be' also. Thus:- भावः 'condition' and भवः 'existence'.",
    "31144": "Thus ग्रह + क (VI. I. 16) = गृहम् 'a house'. The र is changed into ॠ by the rule of _samprasarana_. The plural form गृहाः means 'wife', as she is especially the person that constitutes the house; while the plural of गृहं meaning 'house' will be गृहाणि.",
    "31145": "Vart:- This affix should be confined to the verbs नृत् 'to dance', खन् 'to dig' and रञ्ज 'to dye'.\n\nThus नृत् + ष्वुन् = नर्त + अक (VII. I. I) = नर्तकः 'dancer'. The letter व is indicatory (I .3. 6) and by Rule (IV. I. 4I), it denotes that words formed by prefixes having indicatory च् form their feminine gender by the affix ङीप्. Thus the feminine of नर्तक is नर्तकी; so also खनकः 'miner', fem. खनकी; रजकः 'washer-man', fem. रजकी.\n\nIn the case of the root रञ्ज the nasal is elided. According to the opinion of the author of _ Mahabhashya_, only two verbs are governed by this _sutra_ namely नृत् and खन् . According to him, the verb रञ्ज takes the affix क्वुन्. Thus रञ्ज + क्वुन्  = रज् + यु (VI. 4. 37) = रज् +अक (VII. I. I) = रजकः, feminine रजिका.",
    "31146": "As, गै + थकन् = गाथकः (VI. I. 45) 'a singer', sem. गाथिका.",
    "31147": "By the word च 'also', the word गा of the last _sutra_ is drawn into this. Thus गै + ण्युट् = गा + अन (VII. I. I) = गायनः fem. गायनी; the य is added by (VII. 3. 33).\n\nThe separation of these rules (_yoga_-_vibhaga_ ) relating to गै is for the purpose of the _sutras_ that follow. Had गस्थकन् and ण्युट् च been made one aphorism, the _anuvritti_ of both these affixes would have run into the subsequent _sutras_. But it is intended that the _anuvritti_ of ण्युट् should only run, and hence this _yoga_-_vibhaga_ or division of one _sutra_ into two.",
    "31148": "The verb हा denotes two verbs हाक 'to abandon' and हाङ् 'to go' both belonging to the Third Conjugation, forming जहाति and जिहीते as 3rd per. sing. Thus हा + ण्युट् = हायनः 'a kind of rice' (that which _jahati_ 'leaves off' all water) हायनः 'a year' (that which jihite 'goes through' all conditions.)\n\nThe accents are however different in the two. In one case the _udatta_ is on the middle; in the other, on the last.",
    "31149": "As प्रु + वुन् = प्रो + अक (VII. I. I) = प्रयकः; so also, सरकः, स्रवकः, and लयकः.\n\nThe word _samabhihara_ in the _sutra_ indicates that the action done by the agent must be well performed. The affix _vun_ being thus ordained for the action, when it is well performed, it follows, that it will not be employed where the action is repeatedly ill performed. The affix will be employed even when there is no repetition but the action is well performed even at the first attempt.",
    "31150": "As, जीव् + वुन् = जीवकः 'may he live'; नन्दकः 'may he be happy'.\n\nThe word आशीः means a sort of prayer; and it relates to action. The force of this affix is that of 'an agent with the addition that the action is simply the object of a prayer of some one who wishes that that may be the action of that agent'.",
    "32001": "The object or _karma_ is of three sorts, namely _nivartya_, _vikarya_ and _prapya_.\n\nThe object which has a material cause, but such cause is however unexpressed in the sentence, is called _nivartya_ object; as कुम्भम् करोति 'he makes a pot'; here मृत् 'mud' the material cause of कुम्भ is unexpressed, therefore, कुम्भ is _nivartya_ object. Where the material cause itself is changed, by a modification, into something else, such an object is called _vikarya_ object; as काण्डलावः 'the branch-cutter'. While the object which cannot be approached by any action, and is not affected by it, but is always constant, is called the _prapya_ object; as a वेदाध्यायः 'the reading of _Veda_'; the _Veda_ is always the same.\n\nThey will be illustrated by the following examples:- Of the first kind, we have कुम्भकारः 'a potter' and  नगरकारः 'a city-builder'; of the second, we have काण्डलावः 'a branch-cutter' and शरलावः 'a reed-cutter'. Of the third, वेदाध्यायः 'the learning of _Veda_' and चर्चापाठः 'the reading of _Charcha_'. But compound nouns cannot be formed of such sentences as ग्रामं गच्छति 'he goes to the village', आदित्यं पश्यति 'he sees the sun', हिमवन्तं शृणोति 'he hears the _Himavat_'. The reason is that it is against the usage of the language to form nouns out of these.\n\nVart:- The affix ण comes after the verbs शील्, काम्, भक्ष्य and आचर and the noun in composition with it, retains its original accent. As मांसशीलः 'addicted to flesh', fem. मांसशीला; मांसकामः 'loving flesh', fem. मांसकामा; मांसभक्षः 'carnivorous', fem. मांसभक्षा; and कल्याणाचारः 'good-conducted', fem. कल्याणाचारा ।\n\nVart:- The affix ण comes after the roots ईक्ष 'to look' and क्षम् 'to forbear' under similar circumstances. As सुखप्रतीक्षः, fem. सुखप्रतीक्षा 'expecting happiness'; बहुक्षमः fem. बहुक्षमा 'much forbearing'.",
    "32002": "This debars the affix  क (III. 2. 3); as स्वर्गे + ह्वे + अण् = स्वर्गे + ह्वा + अ = स्वर्गे + ह्वाय + अ (VII. 3. 33) = स्वर्गह्वायः (the य is added by rule (VII. 3. 33), 'when a _krit_ affix with an indicatory ण or म follows', the augment य is added after the verbs that end in long आ). So also तन्तुवायः, धान्यमायः ।",
    "32003": "This debars अण्; as गां + दा + क = गां + द + अ = गोदः 'Giver of cows', (the long आ is elided by (VI. 4. 64,) = So also, कम्बलदः 'who gives a blanket'; पार्ष्णित्रम् 'what protects the rear'; अङ्गुलित्रम् 'what protects the finger' (a thimble)'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when there is no _upasarga_'? Witness गोसन्दायः 'who ceremoniously gives a cow', वडवसन्दाय 'who ceremoniously gives a mare'. Here the compound verb सन्दा takes the affix अण्.",
    "32004": "In the three previous _sutras_, the word in composition was always in the accusative case. This _sutra_ declares that with regard to the verb स्था, the _upapada_ may have any case not necessarily the accusative. As समस्थः = समे तिष्ठति 'who dwells in accessible position'; and विषमस्थः 'having an inaccessible position'.\n\nThis _sutra_ should be divided into two _sutras_ (_yoga_-_bibhaga_). Thus:- (1) सूपि ॥ The affix क comes after every root ending in long आ, when in composition with a case-inflected word; as द्वाभ्यां पिबति = द्वि + पा + क = द्विपः (VI. 4. 64) 'who drinks with two organs' i.e. 'the proboscis and the mouth, an elephant'. So also पादपः 'a plant' (what drinks through the foot). कच्छपः 'a tortoise' (that always protects its mouth by drawing it in, at the approach of danger). (2) सूपिस्थः ॥ The affix क comes after the root स्था when in composition with a word ending in a case-affix. Why do we make this two-fold division, when we see the second rule is included in the first as the verb स्था also ends in a long आ ? The reason is that the first rule applies where the agent is indicated, while the second rule applies where condition is to be denoted. As आखूनामुत्थानम् = आखूत्थः 'a swarm of rats'; so also शलमोत्थः ' a swarm of locusts'.\n\nBoth the words कर्मणि and सुपि are understood in the _sutras_ that follow: _vis_: the word कर्मणि in _sutras_ that relate to transitive verbs, and the word सुपि everywhere else.",
    "32005": "As तुन्द परिमृज आस्ते 'he lay lazy'. So also शोकापनुदः पुत्रो जातः 'a son, destroyer of sorrow is born'.\n\nVart:- This affix is to be applied only then, when the meaning of the word to be formed is 'lazy' and 'giver of happiness'.\n\nVart:- The epithet तुन्द परिमृजः is applied to a lazy person; while तुन्द परिमार्जः means who clears his navel. So शोकापनुदः means giver of happiness, while शोकापनोदः means 'removal of sorrow'.\n\nVart:- The words मूलविभुजः 'a chariot' and the rest should be included in the subdivision of words formed by the affix क. The words belonging to this head can only be recognised by their form, there being no list of them to be found anywhere. Thus मूलविभुजः 'a chariot', नखमुचः 'a bow', काकगुह 'sesamums', कुमुदम् (कौ मोदते) 'a lotus'.",
    "32006": "We applied by _sutra_ 3 the affix क after verbs that ended in long आ and had no _upasarga_. Now begins the case of verbs with _upasarga_. This debars the affix अण्; as सर्वप्रदः (VI. 4. 64) 'giver of all; liberal', पथिप्रज्ञः (VI. 4. 64) 'acquainted with roads'. The long आ of दा and ज्ञा is elided by (VI. 4. 64).\n\nWhy do we say 'when taking प्र'? With any other _upasarga_ these verbs will take the general affix अण्; as गोसन्दाय.",
    "32007": "The verb ख्या ends in long आ and by (III. 2. 3) when compounded with an _upasarga_, it would have taken the affix अण्. This debars अण्; as गोसङ्ख्या (VI. 4. 64) 'a cowherd' (गा सञ्चष्टे).",
    "32008": "The phrase _anupasarga_ is to be read again into this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ 3, though this _anuvritti_ had temporarily lain dormant in _sutra_ 6 and 7. as being unnecessary. This debars क; of this affix ट् and क are indicatory the ट् showing among others that the feminine is formed by the affix ङीप् (IV. 1. 14)\n\nAs, शक्रं गायति = शक्र + गा + टक् =शक्रगः (VI. 4. 64) 'who sings _Sakra_ hymns'. सामगः 'singer of _Sama_'. fem. शक्रगी and सामगी ।\n\nVart:- The affix टक् comes after the verb पा when it means to drink and only when it is in composition with the words सुरा and शीधु as its object. This is an important modification of the general _sutra_. Thus सुरापः fem. सुरापी 'wine-bibber'; शीधुपः fem. शीधुपी 'spirit-drinker'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when in composition with _sura_ and _sidhu_'? Observe क्षीरपा ब्राह्मणी 'the milk-drinking _Brahmani_'; formed by the affix क and the feminine, therefore, not formed by the affix ई but by आ.\n\nWhy do we say 'when पा means to drink'? When पा means 'to protect' this affix is not used; as सुरापा 'who protects wine'.\n\nWhen these words are compounded with an _upasarga_ they do not take टक् but अण्; as शक्रसङ्गायः, सामसङ्गायः ।\n\nVart:- There is diversity in the _Chhandas_ as to the employment of these affixes; as या ब्राह्मणी सुरापी or सुरापा भवति नैनां देवाः पतिलोकं नयन्ति 'the gods do not carry that _Brahmani_ to the regions of her husband who drinks wine'.",
    "32009": "This debars अण्. The word उद्यमन् means 'to raise a load'. Thus अंशं हरति = अंशहरः 'who takes a share, or sharer'; so रिक्थहरः 'an heir'. (हृञ् + अच् = हर् + अ = हरः) (VII. 3. 84).\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not mean to raise up'? For then the affix अण् will be employed; as भारहारः 'a burden-bearer, a porter'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes after the verb ग्रह् when in composition with the words शक्ति 'spear', लाङ्गल 'plough', अङ्कुश 'goad', यष्टि 'staff', तोमर 'an iron club', घट 'jar', घटी 'a small jar', धनुष् 'a bow'; as शक्तिमग्रहः 'a lancer', लाङ्गलग्रहः 'a plough-man', अङ्कुशग्रहः 'an elephant driver', यष्टिग्रहः 'a staff-bearer', तोमरग्रहः 'a club-bearer', घटग्रहः, घटीग्रहः 'a jar-bearer', धनुग्रहः 'a bow-bearer'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes after the verb ग्रह when the word सूत्र is in composition with it and the sense is that of 'holding'; as सूत्रग्रहः 'a thread-holder'. When it has not this meaning we have सूत्रग्राहः 'a thread-taker'.",
    "32010": "In this _sutra_ the verb हृञ् has the sense of _udyamana_ which was specifically excluded in the last. The word वयस् means the condition of human body as dependent upon time. This rule applies to those words which indicate the attainment of appropriate age for the accomplishment of objects described by the _upapada_, or the reaching of that age in which the thing described by the _upapada_ naturally takes place; as अस्थिहरः श्वा 'the dog that has reached the age when it can chew bones' (lit. when it can raise it up); कवचहरः क्षत्रियकुमारः 'the _Kshatriya_ boy old enough to wear (lit. 'to raise up or bear') the shield'; so that the verb here has the sense of 'raising up'.",
    "32011": "The word ताच्छील्यं means a natural inclination or habitual occupation; as पुष्पाहरः (पुष्प + आहरति = पुष्प + आहर) 'he who has a natural tendency towards fetching flowers or whose habitual occupation is to collect flowers'; so also फलाहरः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting inclination'? Otherwise the affix will be अण्; as भारमाहरति = भाराहारः 'who brings load'.",
    "32012": "This debars अण्. The words so formed are especially of feminine gender. As पूजार्हा 'deserving of respect'; so also गन्धार्हा, मालार्हा ।",
    "32013": "The verb रम् is intransitive and the verb जप् can take an object under very limited circumstances, only namely when the object denotes _Sabda_ ; therefore in the case of both these verbs, the object cannot be in composition as an accusative case; therefore, the _upapada_ here must be a general case-inflected word. Hence we have read the _anuvritti_ of the word सुप् from _sutra_ 4 into this, the _anuvritti_ of the word कर्म्म being inapplicable here.\n\nVart:- The words to be formed must have the sense of 'elephant' and a 'tale-bearer'. Thus स्तम्बेरमते = स्तम्बेरमः 'an elephant (lit. who sports in cluster of grass)' कर्णे जपति = कर्णेजपः 'a slanderer (lit. who whispers in the ear)'.\n\nThe affix अच् is not employed when the words to be formed do not mean an 'elephant' and a 'traducer'. Thus स्तम्बे रन्ता 'who plays in clusters of grass'. कर्णे जपिता मशकः 'the mosquito that hums near the ear'.",
    "32014": "As शम् + कृ + अच्  = शङ्करः lit. 'who does good'. So also सम्भवः संवहः । All these are proper nouns.\n\nWhy have we repeated the word _dhatu_ in this aphorism, when it was understood by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ (III. 1. 91)? To this the reply is, that the repetition of the word _dhatu_ shows that there is prohibition of the affix ट, that comes after the verb कृ in certain senses (III. 2. 20), when the word शम् is in composition. The affix अच् will be employed after the verb कृ and not the affix ट्, when शम् is an _upapada_, even when the sense to be indicated is that of cause, habit &c. (III. 2. 20). The result is that the feminine of शङ्कर will be शङ्करा, and not शङ्करी, which, had the affix been ट, would have been the proper feminine (See (IV. 1. 14)). शङ्करा means 'a female-ascetic', 'a vulture' and 'one having the habit of doing good'.",
    "32015": "The word सुप् (III. 2. 4) a noun ending in a case-affix is understood in this aphorism. As खे शेते = खशयः 'who lies in the sky'.\n\nVart:- The affix अच् comes after the verb शी when in composition with the words पार्श्व 'ribs', &c., though not necessarily denoting location; as पार्श्वाभ्यां शेते = पार्श्वशयः 'who reclines on his sides', उदरशयः 'who lies on his stomach', पृष्ठशयः 'who lies on his back'.\n\nVart:- And when the verb शी is preceded by the word दिग्धसह; as दिग्धेन सह शेते = दिग्धसहशयः ॥\n\nVart:- So also when the words उत्तान &c. are in composition with it denoting agent and in the nominative case. As उत्तानः शेते = उत्तानशयः I अवमूर्द्धा शेते = अवमूर्द्धाशयः ।\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_ the affix डच् comes after the verb शी when in composition with the word गिरि in the locative. As गिरौ शेते = गिरिशः 'who lies on the mountain'.\n\nThe letter ड of डच् is indicatory denoting that there is elision of the final vowel with what follows it (I. I. 64).",
    "32016": "The word _adhikarana_ of the last _sutra_ is understood in this. As कुरुषु चरति = कुरुचरः 'who goes among the _Kurus_'. मद्रचरः 'who goes among the Madras'.\n\nOf the affix ट the real affix is अ, the letter ट being indicatory, showing that the feminine of these words is formed by the affix ङीप्. (See. (IV. 1. 14)), as कुरुचरी, मद्रचरी ।",
    "32017": "The _anuvritti_ of the words 'in the locative case' does not extend to this aphorism, and hence the necessity of making a distinct and separate _sutra_.\n\nThus भिक्षाचरः 'a beggar' (who goes for alms); सेनाचरः 'one who goes with an army'; आदायचरः 'one who goes after having taken'.",
    "32018": "As पुरः सरति = पुरःसरः 'who goes in front, a harbinger'. So also अग्रतः सरः and अग्रसरः 'going in front, a leader'.",
    "32019": "Thus पूर्वः सरति = पूर्वसरः 'going in front'.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting the agent'? Otherwise the affix अण् will be employed. As पूर्वदेशं सरति = पूर्वसरः 'going to the east'.",
    "32020": "The word हेतु of this _sutra_ means the final or conclusive cause, and is not the grammatical हेतु meaning agent. ताच्छील्य means habit, and literally, the act of being accustomed to that. आनुलोम्य comes from अनुलोम meaning 'with the hair', that is to say, regular, in natural order, successive, and hence favourable, and agreeable complaisance, acquiescence &c. Of हेतु, we have  शोककरी कन्या 'the daughter that causes sorrow'; यशस्करी विद्या 'honorable science'; कुलकरं धनं 'the family making wealth'. Of ताच्छील्य, we have श्राद्धकरः 'who performs obsequies'; अर्थकरः 'who amasses wealth'. Of आनुलोम्य, we have प्रैषकरः 'who promptly does what he is directed'; वचनकरः 'who regularly does what he is told'.\n \nWhy do we say 'when having these senses'? Otherwise the affix will be अण्. As कुम्भकारः 'potter', नगरकारः 'city-maker'.",
    "32021": "Both the words '_karma_' and '_sup_' are understood in this aphorism; that is to say, sometimes these _upapadas_ stand as accusative case and sometimes they have other cases, as the construction may require. This affix ट comes when the sense is not that of cause &c., as it was in the last _sutra_.\n\nThus दिवाकरः 'the sun'. The word दिवा is an indeclinable and means 'in the day time'. There the _upapada_, therefore, is in the locative case. The sun is so called, because it makes creatures active in the day time.\n\nSo विभाकरः 'the sun' (light-maker); निशाकरः 'the moon' (the night-maker); प्रभाकरः 'the sun'; भास्करः 'the sun' (the letter स is not changed into _visarga_, as it has been so read in the _sutra_); कारकरः 'agent'; अन्तकरः 'death' (end-maker); अनन्तकरः 'magnifying to any extent'; आदिकरः 'the creator'; बहुकरः 'the busy'; नान्दीकरः 'the speaker of benediction'; किङ्करः 'a servant'; लिपिकरः 'a scribe'; लिबिकरः 'a scribe'; बलिकरः 'offering sacrifice'; भक्तिकरः 'a devotee'; कर्तृकरः 'an agent'; चित्रकरः 'a painter'; क्षेत्रकरः 'a cultivator'; एककरः 'doing only one thing', द्विकरः 'doing two things'; त्रिकरः 'doing three things'; जङ्घाकरः 'a runner, an express'; बाहुकरः 'a hero', 'a manual labourer'; अहस्करः 'the sun'; तत्करः 'doing that'; यत्करः 'doing that'; धनुष्करः 'bow-maker'; अरुस्करः 'causing or inflicting wounds'.\n\nVar:- The affix अच् comes after the verb कृ when किम्, यत्, तद् and बहु are in composition with it. The speciality of ट affix is that the feminine of words derived from it is formed by long ई; while the feminine of words derived by अच् is formed by long आ. Thus किङ्करा, यत्करा, तत्करा and बहुकरा; these words might be said to belong to the अजादि class (See (IV. 1. 31)).",
    "32022": "The word भृति means service for hire, wages. The word कर्म does not mean the grammatical object but the word-form कर्म; as कर्मकरः 'a hired labourer' (not a slave); otherwise the affix is अण्; as कर्मकारः 'an artisan'.",
    "32023": "This prohibition relates even when the sense is that of cause, habit &c. The affix ट being prohibited, the general affix अण् takes its place. As शब्दकारः 'sounding, sonorous'; श्लोककारः 'a verse-maker'; कलहकारः 'one who foments quarrels'; गाथाकारः 'a writer of _Gathas_ or _prakritee_ verses'; वैरकारः 'an enemy'; चाटुकारः 'a flatterer'; सूत्रकारः 'an author of _sutras_'; मन्त्रकारः 'a composer of _Mantras_'; पदकारः 'an author of _Padapatha_' .",
    "32024": "Thus स्तम्ब + कृ + इन् = स्तम्बकरि nom. sing. स्तम्बकरिः; so also शकृत्करिः.\n\nVar:- This rule is applicable when the sense of the words to be formed, is that of 'rice' and 'a calf' respectively. Therefore स्तम्बकरिः means 'rice', and शकृत्करिः, 'a calf'.\n\nWhen the words have not the senses of 'rice' and 'a calf', the affix अण् is employed. As स्तम्बकारः 'sheaf-maker', शकृत्कारः 'ordure-maker'.",
    "32025": "Thus दूतिहरिः 'a dog' (a carrier of skin); नाथहरिः 'a beast' (that carries its master).\n\nWhen the words formed do not denote an animal, the affix अण् is employed; as दूतिहारः 'a water-carrier' (a carrier of a leather-bag for holding water). नाथहारः 'a carrier of his master'.",
    "32026": "The word फलेग्रहिः is formed by adding the affix इन् to the verb ग्रह and making the _upapada_ end in the vowel ए. Thus फलानि गृह्णाति = फलेग्रहिः 'the fruit-bearing i. e. a tree'.\n\nThe word आत्मम्भरिः is formed by adding the augment मुम् (म) to the _upapada_ आत्म, and the affix इन् to the verb भृञ्. Thus आत्मानं बिभर्ति = आत्मम्भरिः 'selfish' (one who feeds his own self).\n\nThe word 'and' indicates that there are other such irregularly-formed words. As कुक्षिम्भरिः 'gluttonous, selfish' (caring to feed his own belly). उदम्भरिः 'gluttonous, selfish'.",
    "32027": "Thus ब्रह्मवनिं त्वा क्षत्रवनिम् (_Vaj_. _San_. I. 17., V. 12., VI. 3); उत नो गोपतिं (_Rig_. _Ved_. (VI. 53. 10)) यै ते श्वानौ पथिरक्षो (_Rig_. _Ved_. (X. 14. II)) इन्द्रा यातूनामभवत् पाराशरो हविर्मथीनाम् (_Rig_. _Ved_. (VII. 104. 21)).",
    "32028": "This affix comes after the causative of एज्. Of the affix खश् the letters ख् and श् are indicatory, the real affix is अ. The ख् indicates that the augment मुम् is added to the _upapada_ ending in a vowel (VI. 3. 67). The श indicates that this is a _Sarvadhatuka_ affix (III 4. 113), and therefore the _vikaranas_ like शप् &c. (III. 1. 68.) will be employed here. Thus अङ्गमेजयति = अङ्गमेजयः (अङ्ग + एजि + शप् + खश् = अङ्गम् + एजे + अ + अ) 'who awes the limbs'; जनमेजयः 'who awes man-kind'.\n\nVart:- The affix खश् comes after the verbs अज् 'to go', धेट् 'to suck', तुद् 'to strike', हा 'to leave' when in composition with the words वात 'wind', शुनी 'a bitch', तिल 'sesamum' and शर्द्ध 'flatulence'. As वातमजाः मृगाः 'swift antelopes' (going with the wind); शुनिन्धयः 'a bitch-sucker'; तिलन्तुदः 'an oilman'; शर्द्धञ्जहा माषाः 'a kind of bean' (that causes or cures flatulence). The long ई of शुनी is shortened by (VI. 3. 66).",
    "32029": "The rule of _yathasankhya_ as given in (I. 3. 10) does not however, apply here. For स्तन is compounded with धेट्; as (स्तन + धे + खश् = स्तन + मुम् + धे + शप् + खश् = स्तन + म् + धय् + अ + अ) = स्तनन्धयः 'an infant' (sucking the breast).\n\nBut नासिका is compounded with both ध्मा and धे; as नासिका + ध्मा + खश् = नासिक + म् + धम + अ (VI. 3. 66) and (67); (VII. 3. 78) = नासिकन्धमः 'blowing and breathing through the nose'. So also नासिकन्धयः 'drinking through the nose'.\n\nThat the rule of _yathasankhya_ does not apply here, is indicated by the irregular construction of the _Dvandva_ compound नासिकास्तनयोः. By rule (II. 2. 84.) the word स्तन containing fewer syllables ought to have stood first; one irregularity lets in another.\n\nThe feminine of स्तनन्धयः is स्तनन्धयी, as the verb धे has an indicatory ट् ।",
    "32030": "Here also the irregularly-formed _Dvandva_ compound नाडीमुष्टि showes the non-applicability of the rule of _yathasankhya_ ; for मुष्टि being a घि ought to have stood first (II. 2. 32).\n\nThus नाडिन्धमः 'blowing through the tube'; मुष्टिन्धमः 'blowing through the fist'; नाडिन्धयः 'sucking through the tube', an infant; मुष्टिन्धयः 'an infant'.\n\nThe word 'and' in the aphorism indicates that there are other words also so formed. Thus घटिन्धमः, घटिन्धयः, खारिन्धमः, खारिन्धयः, वातन्धमः, वातन्धयः, 'a mountain'.\n\nThis _sutra_ is not _Panini_'s, but is really a _Vartika_, raised to the rank of a _sutra_ by the author of the _Kasika_. The _Vartikakara_ divides the last _sutra_ in this way: (1) स्तने धेटः ॥ (2) ततो मुष्टो ध्मश्च ॥ (3) नासिकायां ध्मश्च धेटश्च ॥ (4) नाडी मुष्टि घटोखारीष्विति वक्तव्यम् ॥",
    "32031": "Thus कूलमुद्रुजति = कूलमुद्रुजः 'breaking down banks' (such as a chariot, river, elephant, &c.); कूलमुद्वहः 'tearing up or carrying away the bank'.",
    "32032": "As वहंलिहो गौः 'the shoulder-licking cow'; अभ्रंलिहो वायुः 'the cloud-licking wind'.",
    "32033": "Thus प्रस्थं पचति = प्रस्थम्पचा 'a pot having the capacity to cook a _prastha_ of food'; so also द्रोणम्पचः, खारिम्पचः 'a kettle'.",
    "32034": "The aphorism has its scope when the words formed do not denote measures, which was the case in the last _sutra_. Thus मितम्पचा ब्राह्ममणी 'the _Brahmani_ who cooks a little i. e. niggardly _Brahmani_'; नखम्पचा यवागूः 'the nail-scorching barley gruel'.",
    "32035": "As विधुन्तुदः राहुः 'the _Rahu_ that eclipses the moon; अरुन्तुदः 'corrosive, wounding the vital parts'. For the addition of the augment मुम् after the word अरुस्, see (VI. 3. 67).",
    "32036": "Thus असूर्य + दृश्  + खश् = असूर्यम्पश्यः; as असूर्यम्पश्या राजदारा 'the king's wives not even seeing the sun' (being shut up in the harem, and so having no opportunity of seeing the sun, that is, they are so well protected that even the sun cannot see them, much less any irreverent gaze).\n\nSo also ललाटन्तपः 'heating the fore-head' (such as the sun).\n\nThe word असूर्य is an incomplete or impossible compound, as the negative अ applies to the verb दृश् and not to the word सूर्य. This is in opposition to the rule of _samartha_ _pada_ _vidhi_ (II. I. 2).",
    "32037": "Thus उग्रं पश्यति = उग्रम्पश्यः 'fierce-looking'; इरया मद्यति = इरम्मदः 'delighting in drinking an epithet of _Agni_, a flash of lightning'. So पाणिन्धमाः पन्थानः 'chilly roads'.",
    "32038": "Thus प्रियं वदति = प्रियंवदः 'who speaks kindly'; वशंवदः 'who professes submission'.\n\nOf the affix खच्, the letters ख् and च् are indicatory; ख् indicates the insertion of the augment मुम् (VI. 3. 37), and च् shows that there is shortening of the vowel in certain cases (VI. 4. 94).\n\nIn the case of प्रिय and वश with वद्, the affix खश् would have given the same result as the affix खच्. Making a separate affix in this _sutra_ is for the sake of the aphorisms that follow, where this affix will produce different effects than खश्.\n\nVart:- The affix खच् comes after the verb गम् 'to go' when a word ending in a case-affix is in composition with it. As मितङ्गमो हस्ती 'the slow moving i. e. an elephant'; मितङ्गमा हस्तिनी 'the slow-moving i. e. a she-elephant'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes under similar circumstances when the word in composition with गम् is विहायस्; and the letter is then replaced by the word विह. As विहायसा गच्छति = विहङ्गमः 'a bird (that which goes through the sky)'.\n\nVart:- In the _Vartikas_ above given, the affix खच् may optionally be considered as if it had an indicatory ड. The force of ड is to cause elision of the final vowel with what follows it. As विहङ्गः or विहङ्गमः 'a bird'. So also भुजङ्गमः or भुजङ्गः 'a serpent' (what goes crookedly).\n\nVart:- विहायस् is replaced by विह when the affix ड (III 2. 48) comes after the verb गम्; as विहङ्गः 'a bird'. Thus we have three forms: विहग, विहङ्ग, विहङ्गम ।",
    "32039": "The verb तप् belongs both to _Bhu_ and _Chur_ classes. Both are meant in the _sutra_. In the case of _Bhvadi_, the verb तापि is the causative ending in णि of तप्; while in _Churadi_, all verbs take णि.\n\nThus द्विषन्तं तापयति = द्विषन्तपः (VI. 4. 94) 'one who destroys his enemies', so also परन्तपः 'one who subdues his enemies, a hero'.\n\nThis affix however, will not apply when the above _upapadas_ are in the feminine gender. In this case the general affix अण् will be employed; as द्विषतीं तापयति = दिषतीतापः ।",
    "32040": "The word व्रत means a vow taken according to the rules of _Dharma_ _sastra_. Thus वाचंयम आस्ते 'he has taken the vow of rigid silence'.\n\nWhy do we say 'vow'? Otherwise the form is वाग्यामः 'restraining speech' (VI. 3.69).",
    "32041": "As पुरं धारयति = पुरन्दरः 'name of _Indra_ (who splits asunder cities)' (VI. 3. 69) and (VI. 4. 94); सर्वंसहो राजा 'the king who is all-forbearing'.\nVart:- So also when the word भग is in composition with the verb दारि; as भगन्दरः 'a fistula in the anus'.",
    "32042": "As सर्वङ्कषः खलः 'a villain, a rogue'; कूलङ्कषा नदी 'a river'; अभ्रङ्कषो गिरिः 'a mountain'; करीषङ्कषा वात्या 'a strong wind'.",
    "32043": "As मेघङ्करः 'producing clouds'; ऋर्तिकरः 'giving pain'; भयङ्करः 'frightful'.\n\nVart:- The _tadanta_ _vidhi_ applies in the case of _upapadas_ like भय. &c. This is an exception to the _vartika_ under (1. 1. 72.) by which, in the case of affixes, _tadanta_-_vidhi_ was prohibited. Thus we have अभयङ्करः 'who causes security'.",
    "32044": "The word 'and' denotes that the affix खच् is also to be included.\n\nThus क्षेमकारः or क्षेमकरः 'propitious'; प्रियकारः or प्रियङ्करः 'showing kindness'; मद्रकारः or मद्रङ्करः 'causing delight'. \n\nThe repetition of the affix अण्, when its _anuvritti_ could have been read into this _sutra_ by using the word वा 'optionally', indicates that these words never take the affix ट of _sutra_ 20 though cause, habit, &c., may be denoted; so that the feminine of those words is formed by आ and not by ई; as अल्पारम्भाः क्षेमकराः 'small beginnings lead to or cause prosperity'.",
    "32045": "The word 'सुपि' of _sutra_ 4 is understood here.\n\nThus आशिसम्भवः meaning 'food', literally that by which one is satiated. आशिती भवती अनेन. Here the word denotes instrument. And आशितसम्भवः also means 'satiety', which denotes condition.",
    "32046": "Both the words कर्मणि and सुपि of _sutra_ 1 and 4 are understood here and should be applied as the occasion requires. Thus विश्वम्भरा 'earth' (that which supports all); रथन्तर 'the _Rathantara_ _Sama_'; पतिंवरा 'a girl' lit. (who is about to choose a husband); शत्रुञ्जयः 'an elephant' lit. (who conquers the enemy); युगन्धरः 'a mountain' or 'the pole of a carriage to which the yoke is fixed'; शत्रुंसहः '_Satrunsaha_' (withstanding an enemy); शत्रुन्तपः '_Satruntapa_' (destroying an enemy); अरिन्दमः '_Arindama_' (victorious).\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting a name' ? Observe कुटुम्बभारः 'he who supports his family'.",
    "32047": "As सुतङ्गमः '_Sutangama_'. Though the verb गम् could well have been included in the last aphorism, the separation serves the purpose of carrying the _anuvritti_ of गम् into the subsequent _sutras_.",
    "32048": "The _anuvritti_ of the word सञ्ज्ञायाम् does not extend to this. As अन्तगः 'having gone to the end, thoroughly conversant'; अत्यन्तगः 'going too fast'; अध्वगः 'a way-farer'; दूरगः 'going to a distant place'; पारगः 'completely familiar'; सर्वगः 'going everywhere, the Supreme Being'; अनन्तगः 'going to infinity, moving for ever'.\n\nOf the affix ड the letter ड् is indicatory, the real affix being अ. The ड indicates that the टि portion of the word to which this is added, must be elided (VI. 4. 143); as अन्त + गम् + ड = अन्त + ग् + अ (the टि portion अम् of गम् is elided). Now though the rule (VI. 4. 143) says 'when that which has an indicatory ड, follows, there is elision of the टि of a भ'; yet in the present case, such elision takes place, although the word गम् here is not one of those called भ (l. 4. 18); because the presence of ड as an indicatory letter must not be unmeaning.\n\nVart:- The ड is also employed when the words in composition are सर्वत्र 'everywhere' and पन्न 'creeping'; as सर्वत्रगः 'Supreme Spirit'; पन्नगः 'snake.'\n\nVart:- So also when the word in composition is उरस् 'breast', and there is elision of its final. As उरस् + गम् + ड = उरगः 'moving on breast, a snake'.\n\nVart:- So also with the words सु 'well' and दुर् 'bad', when the resulting words denote location. As सुगः 'that in which one goes easily, easy of access'. दुर्गः 'difficult of access, a fort'.\n\nVart:- So also with the preposition निर्, the word to be formed meaning country; as निर्गः 'a country'.\n\nVart:- Others say, that this ड is added when other words besides the above stand as _upapadas_. Thus स्त्र्यगारगः (स्त्री + अगार + गम् + ड) 'who goes to the women's compartment'; ग्रामगः 'going to the village'; गुरुतल्पगः 'who pollutes the bed of his guru'.",
    "32049": "The affix ड is understood in this _sutra_. Thus तिमिं वध्यात् = तिमिहः 'may he kill the whale'; शत्रुहः 'may he kill the enemy'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when benediction is intended'? Otherwise we have शत्रुघातः 'who kills his enemy'.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् comes after the verb आहन् when the word दारु 'wood' is in composition with it, and the final letter of the word so formed is changed into ट, when the word so formed denotes a name. As दारु आहन्ति = दार्वाघाटः (दारु + आहन् + अण्) 'the wood-pecker'.\n\nVart:- So also optionally when the word चारु 'beautiful' is in composition under the circumstances detailed in the last _vartika_: as चार्वाघाटः or चार्वाघातः ।\n\nVart:- So also, when the verb हन् is preceded by the preposition सम्, and is in composition with a word in the objective case, the affix अण् is employed; and the final is replaced by ट; as वर्णान् संहन्ति = वर्णसङ्घाटः or वर्णसङ्घातः 'the alphabet'; पदानि संहन्ति = पदसङ्घाटः or पदसङ्घातः 'connecting the words that are separated, an annotator'.",
    "32050": "As, क्लेशापहः पुत्रः 'the pain-allayer i. e. the son’; तमोपहः सूर्यः 'the darkness-destroyer i. e. the sun'.\n\nThis aphorism has its scope when the sense is not that of benediction.",
    "32051": "The affix णिनि comes after the verb हन् 'to kill' when the word in composition with it is कुमार 'a child', or शीर्ष 'head'.\n\nThus कुमार + हन् + णिनि = कुमार + घात + इन् (VII. 3. 54) and (VII. 3. 32) = कुमारघातिन् nom. sing. कुमारघाती 'child-killer'. So also शीर्षघातिन् nom. sing. शीर्षघाती 'head-killer'.\n\nThe word शीर्ष is an irregular form of the word शिरस् ।",
    "32052": "The word लक्षणा of this _sutra_ gives rise to the doubt whether it means लक्षणे कर्तरि or लक्षणवति कर्तरि. In the former case the meaning will be 'when the agent is itself the mark'; as जायाघ्नः 'a mole' (a mark on the body indicative of the death of one's wife). In the latter case the meaning will be 'when the agent is possessed of the attribute denoted by the word'; as जायाघ्नः 'the murderer of his wife'; पतिघ्नी 'the murderer of her husband'.\n\nOf the affix टक् the letters ट् and क् are indicatory. The ट् shows that the feminine is formed by ई, and क् causing elision of the penultimate अ of हन्. Thus जाया + हन् + टक् = जाया + ह्न् + अ (VI. 4. 98) = जायाघ्नः (VII. 3. 54).",
    "32053": "As जायाघ्नस्तिलकालकः 'the mole' (literally that which indicates the death of one's wife); पतिघ्नी पाणिरेखा 'the line of the palm of the hand' (that which indicates the death of one's husband). These two forms were deducible also from the last aphorism. श्लेष्मघ्नं मधु 'honey' (literally that which has the property of destroying the phlegm). पित्तघ्नं घृतं 'clarified butter' (lit. that which destroys the bile).\n\nWhy do we say 'when the agent is not a human being'? Observe आखुघातः शूद्रः ‘a _Sudra_' (literally one who kills the mice). Here the affix is अण्.\n\nWhy is the affix टक् not employed in the following? चौरघातो हस्ती 'an elephant' (i.e. who kills a thief.) Here the word is formed by the affix अण् on the analogy of _sutra_ (III. 3. 113) which allows a diversity in case of _kritya_ affixes, which diversity is extended in this case to a _krit_ affix.",
    "32054": "This _sutra_ applies where the agent is a human being. As हस्तिनं हन्तुं शक्तः = हस्तिघ्नः मनुष्यः 'a man who is strong enough to kill an elephant'; so also कपाटघ्नः 'a burglar' (who is capable of breaking open the doors).\n \nWhy do we say 'where power is indicated'? Observe विषेण हस्तिनं हन्ति = हस्तिघातः 'who kills the elephant by poison'. Here the affix is अण्.",
    "32055": "These forms are thus evolved. The affix क is employed after the verb हन् in composition with पाणि 'hand' and ताड 'a blow' as object; then the टि portion of हन् i. e. अन् is elided, and ह is changed into घ irregularly. Thus पाणि + हन् + क = पाणि + ड् + अ = पाणिघः 'a drummer' (workman or handicraftsman); ताडघः 'a smith'.\n\nWhy 'when denoting an artificer'? Observe पाणिघातः 'boxing'; ताडघातः 'hammering'.\n\nVart:- The word राजघः should be enumerated in this connection; राजघः 'a regicide'.",
    "32056": "The affix च्वि (V. 4. 50.) is added to a noun when it is in composition with the verbs भू 'to become', कृ 'to make' and अस् 'to be'; its force being that a thing attains to a condition in which it previously was not. The च्वि being an optional affix, its sense is two-fold; namely, words ending in च्वि and words not ending in च्वि. Both may have the force of च्वि. In the present _sutra_, however, the words that actually end in च्वि have been excluded, while words which do not take the affix च्वि, but have the force of च्वि are included in the present _sutra_.\n\nThus आढ्य + कृ + ख्युन् = आढ्य + कर् + अन् = आढ्यं करणं 'that by the instrumentality of which the poor becomes rich, viz., wealth, prosperity, means of enriching'; सुभगङ्करणम् 'making happy'; स्थूलङ्करणम् 'by which one becomes big'; पलितङ्करणम् 'rendering grey'; नग्नङ्करणम् 'making naked'; अन्धङ्करणम् 'making blind'; प्रियङ्करणम् 'showing kindness'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the force is that of the affix च्वि'? Otherwise आढ्यं तैलेन कुर्वन्ति i.e अभ्यजयन्ति 'they anoint with oil'. Here though something is joined with what it previously was not joined, namely with oil, yet as the radical word is not prominent here, the sense is not that of च्वि and hence this counter-example.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not ending in the affix च्वि'? Observe आढ्यी कुर्वन्ति अनेन 'they make rich by this'. Here the affix ख्युन् is not employed.\n\nIt might be objected : 'well if ख्युन् is not used, then the affix ल्युट् must be used (III. 3. 117) as there is no difference between ख्युन् and ल्युट्; both having the efficient portion यु; what is then the use of prohibiting च्वि? We reply, 'because there is this prohibition, when the affix ख्युन् is not employed the affix ल्युट् will also be not employed. Thus by implication the affix ल्युट् is also prohibited. The prohibition of च्वि in this _sutra_ is for the sake of the aphorisms that follow'.\n\nPatanjali observes this prohibition as superfluous, because there is no distinction between ल्युट् and ख्युन्. For the word formed by any one of these affixes have the same form and the same accent. Nor there is any distinction in the feminines of their derivatives. For the word formed by नञ्, स्नञ्, ईक्, अक् and ख्युन् take ई in the feminine as well as the words तरुन and तलन. Nor there is any distinction in their _samasas_. For in both the cases it will be _nitya_ _samasa_. Nor is the prohibition made for the sake of the augment मुम्. For it being an indeclinable, मुम् cannot come after it. The prohibition therefore is of no use to this _sutra_ but it is inserted here for the sake of the following _sutras_.",
    "32057": "Thus आढ्यम्भविष्णुः 'becoming rich (who was not rich before)'; आढ्यम्भावुकः 'becoming rich'; सुभगम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming happy'; स्थूलम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming big'; पलितम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming grey'; नग्नम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming naked'; अन्धम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming blind'; प्रियम्भविष्णुः or -भावुकः 'becoming an object of affection, amiable'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the agent'? Not so when it denotes the instrument. The affixes will apply when the sense of the _upapada_ is that of च्वि, otherwise not; as आढ्यीं भविता 'he will be rich'.\n\nThese affixes will not apply when the _upapada_ ends in च्वि; आढ्यी भविता ।",
    "32058": "By _sutra_ 4 of this chapter, the _anuvritti_ of the word सुपि is to be read into this _sutra_. It might be objected 'why do we not read the _anuvritti_ of the word कर्म instead of सुपि, because the verb स्पृश् is a transitive verb, and after such verbs, the _anuvritti_ of कर्म ought to come by _sutra_ 4'? To this we say there is no harm in reading the _anuvritti_ of सुपि in this case; because the word कर्तरि of the last _sutra_ is also, in a way understood here, and indicates the collection of all sorts of agents whether objects, instruments &c., and this can only be when the first member of the compound is a word in general.\n\nThus घृतं स्पृशति = घृतस्पृश्, nom. sing. घृतस्पृक् 'he who touches clarified butter'. स्पृश् + क्विन् + सु = स्पृश् + वि + ० (VI. 1. 68) = स्पृक् + ० (VI. 1. 67,) and (VIII. 2. 62). So also मन्त्रेण स्पृशति = मन्त्रस्पृक् 'who touches with hymns'; जलेन स्पृशति = जलस्पृक् 'who touches with water'. But उदकेन स्पृशति = उदकस्पर्शः; here we have the general affix अण्.\n\nThe न् of क्विन् is to distinguish this affix from affixes like क्विप् &c. For, had it been merely क्वि, then in _sutra_ (VIII. 2. 62.) we should have used क्वि प्रत्ययस्य कुः, and it would have been ambiguous, for क्वि might be explained as meaning both क्वि and क्विप्, as क्य means क्यष्, क्यप् &c. To remove this ambiguity, न् is added to make a distinctive affix. The न् cannot be for the sake of accent. (VI. 1. 117), the verb being monosyllabic would of itself have taken that accent.",
    "32059": "The first five words are irregular forms. Thus ऋतु + यज् + क्विन् = ऋत्विक् 'he who performs sacrifice in the season (ऋतौ) or to the season (ऋतुम्). This word, however is a रूढि word in which it is fruitless to search for its etymological meaning. धृष् + क्विन् = दधृक्. Here there is reduplication and the final has acute accent. सृज् + क्विन् = स्रक्. Here there is augment अस्. दृश् + क्विन् = दिक्. So also उत् + स्निह् + क्विन् = उष्णिक्. All these are in fact crude nouns, their current meaning having little traces of their root meaning.\n\nThe affix क्विन् comes after the three roots युज्, अञ्चु, and क्रुञ्च. Being read along with the five above-mentioned irregularly-formed words, there is some irregularity in the application of क्विन् to these verbs. Thus the affix क्विन् comes after अञ्चु only when a word ending with any case-affix precedes it in composition. As प्र + अञ्चु + क्विन् = प्राञ्च् nom. sing. प्राङ् (VI. 4. 24); (VII. I. 70), (VIII. 2. 23 and 62) 'east'; so also प्रत्यङ् 'west'; उदङ् 'north'.\n\nThe affix क्विन् comes after युजिर् and क्रुञ्च् when these are uncombined. Thus युज् + क्विन् = युज्. In nominative singular, युज् + सु = युञ्ज् + स् (VII. 1. 71) = युञ्ज् + ० (VI. 1. 68) = युङ् (VIII. 2. 62) 'who joins'. When the root युज् is in composition with an _upapada_, it takes the affix क्विप् (see _sutra_ 61). As अश्वयुक् 'yoked with horses'.\n\nSo also क्रुञ्च् + क्विन् = क्रुञ्च्, nom. sing. क्रुङ्, 'a curlew'. The non-elision of the ञ (VI. 4. 24) of क्रुञ्च् is an irregularity, as this word has been taught in connection with other irregular words.",
    "32060": "The force of 'and' is that the क्विन् also comes under similar circumstances. त्यद् &c. are pronouns, for a list of which see (I. 1. 27). Thus त्यादृश् nom. sing. त्यादृक्, 'such-like' when it is formed by क्विन्; and त्यादृशः 'such-like' when the affix is कञ्. So also तद् + दृश् + क्विन् = तादृश् (VI. 3. 91) nom. sing. तादृक् (VI. 1. 68), (VIII. 2. 36 and 62), (VIII. 4. 56); and तादृशः when कञ् is the affix. So यादृक् or यादृशः 'what-like'.\n\nWhat is the force of the letter ञ् of कञ्? It is for the sake of accent; the _udatta_ is on the first syllable of those words which are formed by an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् (VI. 1. 117). But the indicatory न् would have given the same accent, there being no difference between कञ् and कन् in this respect. The indicatory ञ् then serves only the purpose of distinguishing the affix कञ् from कन् in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 15) in which कञ् is taken and not कन्. Had we not formed this separate affix, then for कञ्करप् of that _sutra_, we should have read कन् क्वरप् so that the feminine of words formed by कन् would have also taken long ई, so that the feminine of यावकः (याव + कन्) (V. 4. 29) would have been यावकी instead of यावका.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not signifying perception'? See तं पश्यति = तद्दर्शः 'who sees that'. The words त्यादृक्, तादृश् &c. are crude nouns, in which the etymological sense of the root not being visible, the act of seeing can never be denoted by these words.\n\nVart:- This rule applies also when the words समान and अन्य are in composition with दृश्. As सदृक् or सदृशः 'like' (समान + दृश् + क्विन् = स + दृश्) (VI. 3. 89); so also अन्यादृशः or अन्यादृक् 'of another kind'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्स comes also after the root दृश्. As तादृक्षः, यादृक्षः, अन्यादृक्षः and कीदृक्षः । तद् + दृश् + क्स = ता + दृश् + क्स (VI. 3. 91.) = तादृष् + स (VIII. 2. 36) = तादृक् + स (VIII. 2. 41) = तादृक् + ष (VIII. 3. 59) = तादृक्षः ।",
    "32061": "The phrase 'the word ending with a case-affix' is understood in this _sutra_. The _anuvritti_ of कर्म is not to be taken in this _sutra_ for the same reasons as in _sutra_ 58 _ante_. The _upasargas_ are also words ending in a case-affix i. e. they are also _subanta_ words. Their special mention in this section, indicates by implication (_jnapaka_) that wherever in the previous _sutras_, the word _subanta_ (a case-inflected word) is used, it does not include an _upasarga_ (III 1. 106).\n\nThe root सू being read in conjunction with द्विष् shows that अदादि class verb is meant here, and not तुदादि class. The verb युज् includes, both युजिर् 'to join' and युज् 'to concentrate one's mind'. The verb विद् includes the three verbs having the sense of 'to know', 'to become' and 'to consider', but does not include the verb विद् 'to gain', because that root has an indicatory लृ (विद्लृ) while all these verbs have indicatory अ.\n\nThus, सत्-शुचिषत् 'dwelling in purity'; अन्तरिक्षसत् 'dwelling in the skies', 'epithets of _Brahma_' (_Kath_. (5. 2)); उपसत् 'serving'. सू - अण्डसूः 'oviparous'; शतसूः 'bringing forth hundred'; प्रसूः 'parent'. द्विष् – मित्रद्विट् 'treacherous'; प्रद्विट् 'hostile'. द्रुह् – मित्रध्रुक् 'treacherous'; प्रध्रुक् 'hostile' (VIII. 2. 37). दुह् - गोधुक् 'cow milker'; प्रध्रुक् 'milker' (VIII. 2. 32.) and (37). युज् - अश्वयुक् 'carriage'; प्रयुक् 'impulse'. विद् – वेदवित् 'knower of _Veda_'; प्रवित् 'knower'; ब्रह्मवित् 'knower of _Brahma_'. भिद् - काष्टभित् 'wood-cutter'; प्रभित् 'cutter'. छिद् - रज्जुच्छिद् 'rope-cutter'; प्रच्छिद् 'a cutter'. जि - शत्रुजित् 'enemy-conqueror'; प्रजित् 'conqueror'. नी - सेनानीः 'leader of an army'; प्रणीः 'a leader'; ग्रामणीः 'head-borough'; अग्रणीः 'first'. (Why is there cerebral ण in these words ? Because the word ग्रामणी has a cerebral ण in _sutra_ (V. 2. 78) and that indicates that these words will have ण, as also by _sutra_ (VIII. 4. 3)). राज् - विराट् 'splendour'; सम्राट् 'emperor' (the letter म is added by _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 25)).\n\nThis _sutra_ is a continuation and expansion of _sutras_ 75 and 76 _sup_.",
    "32062": "The words '_upasarga_' and '_supi_' are understood in this _sutra_. As अर्द्धं भजते = अर्द्धभाज् nom. sing. अर्द्धभाक् 'sharing a half'. So also when in composition with a preposition; as प्रभाक् 'division'.",
    "32063": "The words '_upasarga_' and '_supi_' are understood here. As तुर + सह् + ण्वि = तुरासाह् nom. sing. तुराषाट् 'name of _Indra_'. The dentals स is changed into cerebral ष by (VIII. 3. 56), and the ह् into ट by (VIII. 2. 31). The final अ of तुर is lengthened by (VI. 3. 137). See _Rig_. _Veda_. (I. 175. 2), (III. 48 5).",
    "32064": "As प्रष्ठवाह् Ist sing. प्रष्ठवाट् 'carrying a _prashtha_ measure'; so, दित्यवाट् ।\n\nThis division of this _sutra_ from the last is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_, into which the _anuvritti_ of वह् only is carried and not of सह्. See _Yajur_. _Veda_. (XIV. 10), (XVIII. 26).",
    "32065": "As कव्यवाहनः पितॄणाम् (_Yajur_. _Ved_. II. 29) 'fire that carries the oblation to the _pitris_'; पुरीषवाहनः 'carrier of water'; पुरीष्यवाहनः (_Yaj_. _Ved_. (XI. 44)). The feminine of these words is formed by adding long ई ।",
    "32066": "As अग्निश्च हव्यवाहनः 'fire, the carrier of oblation to the gods'. (_Rig_. _Ved_. I. 44. 2).\n\nWhen this word occurs in the middle of a _pada_, or at the beginning, the form is हव्यवाट्, which is derived by adding the affix ण्वि (_sutra_ (64)). As हव्यवाडग्निरजरः पिता नः 'the never-decaying _agni_ or fire that carries oblation to the gods, is our father'. (_Rig_. _Ved_. III. 2. 2.)",
    "32067": "The words छन्दसि, उपसर्गे and सुपि are understood in this _sutra_. The verb जन् includes two verbs meaning 'to be born' and 'to happen'; so also सन् means both 'to give' and 'to worship'.\n\nOf the affix विट् the letter ट् is indicatory, and is qualifying, as in (VI. 4. 41), by which rule the final nasal of जन्, सन् &c. is replaced by long आ when the affix विट् follows, and the whole affix is elided by (VI. 1. 67).\n\nAs अप् + जन् + विट् = अब्जाः (_Rig_. _Ved_. (VII. 34. 16)) 'born in water' (VI. 4. 41); गोषाः 'born in the heaven i.e. God' (_Rig_. _Veda_ (IV. 40. 5)). So also from सन् - गोषाः 'acquiring or bestowing cows' (VIII. 3. 108); गोषा इन्द्रो नृषा असि 'O _Indra_ bestower of cows! thou art lover of mankind' (_Rig_. _Veda_ (IX. 2. 10)). From खन् – विसखाः 'digger of lotus stalk'; कपूखाः 'digger of well'. From क्रम् - दधिक्राः 'who gets milk' (_Rig_. (IV. 39. I)) and (40.5). From गम् – अग्रेगा उन्नेतॄणाम् 'the leader'.",
    "32068": "The _anuvritti_ of the word '_Chhandasi_' does not extend to this _sutra_.\n\nThus आममत्ति =आमात् 'eating raw food'; शस्यात् 'granivorous'.\n\nBut with अन्न as an _upapada_, we have अन्नादः 'eating food', which is formed by the general affix अण् (III 2. 1).",
    "32069": "As क्रव्यमत्ति = क्रव्यात् 'carnivorous'.\n\nWhy has it been made a separate _sutra_, when this form could have been obtained by the last _sutra_ also? To this the _vartika_ replies: 'This has been made a separate _sutra_ in order to indicate that the rule of वासरूप (III. 1. 94) does not apply here. Therefore the affix अण् will not apply in the alternative. If the affix अण् does not apply, how then we get the form क्रव्यादः which is evidently formed by the affix अण् ? The affix अण् comes after the root when the word formed means the eater of meat which has been cut, dressed and cooked'; thus क्रव्यादः means a man who eats meat cooked and prepared, i. e. a meat-eater as opposed to a vegetarian, while क्रव्यात् means an animal which eats raw flesh; the word क्रव्यादः in fact may be regarded as an irregular form falling under पृषोदरादि class of _sutra_ (VI. 3. 109).",
    "32070": "As कामदुघा धेनुः 'a milch cow, giving abundance of milk'; so also अर्थदुघा, धर्मदुघा ।",
    "32071": "The above words contain both the verb and the _upapada_; the fact of their being so given indicates that there is some irregularity in the application of the affix.\n\nThus the affix ण्विन् comes after the verb वह् preceded by the _upapada_ श्वेत as denoting an agent, while the force of the whole word so formed denotes an object. As श्वेता एनं वहन्ति = श्वेतवाह् nom. sing. श्वेतवाः 'a name of Indra' (whom white horses carry).\n\nThe affix ण्विन् is applied to the verb शंस् 'to praise' when preceded by the word उक्थ as object or instrument; and then the nasal is irregularly dropped. As उक्थानि उक्थैर्वा शंसति = उक्थशास्, nom. sing. उक्थशाः (_Rig_. _Ved_. II. 39. 1.) 'a reciter of hymns, the name of the sacrificer'.\n\nThe ण्विन् is applied after the verb दाशृ 'to give', preceded by पुरो, and द is changed into ड, the force of the whole word denoting an object. As पुरो दाशन्ति एनं = पुरोडाश्, nom. sing. पुरोडाः (_Rig_. _Ved_. III. 28. 2) 'an offering'.\n\nVart:--The augment उस् is added to the words श्वेतवाह् &c., when the _pada_ affixes follow. Thus before _pada_ terminations श्वेतवाह् becomes श्वेतवस् । Therefore its Instrumental dual is श्वेतवोभ्याम्, pl. श्वेतवोभिः ।\n\nThe augment उस् is not applied before सर्वनामस्थान and भ terminations. As श्वेतवाहौ, श्वेतवाहः ।",
    "32072": "As अवयाज्, nom. sing. अवयाः (_Rig_. _Ved_. I. 173. 12) 'name of a Vedic priest'; as त्वं यज्ञे वरुणस्यावया असि 'Thou art the priest of _Varuna_ in the sacrifice'.\n\nThe division of this aphorism from the last in which it could have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ in which the _anuvritti_ of यज only runs. This word is thus declined:-\n\n- 1st. अवयाः, अवयाजौ, अवयाजः\n- 2nd. अवयाजं, अवयाजौ, अवयाजः  \n- 3rd. अवयाजा, अवयोभ्यां, अवयोभिः",
    "32073": "As उपयङ्भिरूर्ध्वं वहन्ति 'they carry it up with the उपयज् formulas'. उपयज् is the name of eleven formulas at a sacrifice.\n\nThe word '_Chhandas_' has been repeated here though the _anuvritti_ of the word '_mantra_' was present in it, in order to include the _Brahmana_ literature also.\n\nThe च् is indicatory and is useful in including the affix विच् in the larger group called वि (which includes क्विन्, क्विप्, ण्वि, विट्), as in the _sutra_ येरपृक्तस्य (VI. I. 67).\n\nWhy has this _sutra_ been made, since the affix विच् would have been valid even by aphorism 75? The _sutra_ has been separately made to show that it is a restrictive rule here. The form उपयज् is found in the _Chhandas_ only, and not in the ordinary literature.",
    "32074": "The force of 'and' is to include विच्. Thus सुदा + मनिन् = सुदामन्, 1st. sing. सुदामा (_Rig_. VI. 20. 7) 'one who gives liberally'; अश्व + स्था + मनिन् = अश्वत्थामन्, 1st. sing. अश्वत्थामा 'the name of _Asvatthaman_'; सुधा + क्वनिप् = सुधी + वन् (VI. 4 .66) = सुधीवन्, 1st. sing. सुधीवा 'having good understanding'; सुपा + क्वनिप् = सुपीवन्, 1st. sing. सुपीवा 'a good drinker'. भूरि + दा + वनिप् = भूरिदावन्, 1st. sing. भूरिदावा (_Rig_. II. 27. 17) 'liberal'; घृतपावन् 1st. sing. घृतपावा (_Yaj_. VI. 19) ghee-drinker'.\n\nThe affix विच् is also included in this aphorism. As कीलाल + पा + विच् = कीलालपाः (_Rig_. X. 91. 14) 'nectar-drinker'; शुभंवाः (_Rig_. IV. 3. 6.) and _Panini_ (VII. 3. 46) 'beautifully going'; रामस्योपदाः 'an offering of _Rama_.' (see _sutra_ (III. 3. 106) and _Yajur_. _Ved_. XXX. 9).",
    "32075": "The word छन्दसि is not understood here. As सु + शृ 'to injure' + मनिन् = सुशर्मन्, 1st. sing. सुशर्मा 'who destroys well i.e. destroys sin or ignorance'. प्रातर् + इ 'to go' + क्वनिप् = प्रातर् + इत् + वन् (VI. I. 71) = प्रातरित्वन्, 1st. sing. प्रातरित्वा 'who goes early'. वि + जन् + वनिप् = वि + जा + वन् (VI. 4. 41) = विजावन्. 1st. sing. विजावा 'who brings forth'. अग्रेगावा 'who goes before'. रिप् + विच् = रेष् (VII. 3. 86) 1st. sing. रेड् 'who injures'; as in रेडसि पर्णं नयेः (_Yajur_. _Ved_. VI. 18).\n\nThe word 'also' in this aphorism has the force of removing all conditions under which these affixes were employed in the previous aphorisms, that is to say, these affixes come even when there is no _upapada_. As पीवा, धीवा.\n\nThe words 'are seen' in this _sutra_ show that all verbs do not admit of these affixes indiscriminately. It is only when we see a particular form that we can infer the existence of these affixes.",
    "32076": "As उखायाः स्रंसते = उखास्रत् (VI. 4. 24) 'falling from the pot'; पर्णध्वत् 'falling from the leaves'; वाहाद् भ्रश्यति = वाहाभ्रश्,1st. sing. वाहाभ्रट् 'falling from a car'. The हा is long by (VI. 3. 137). See _Rig_. _Ved_. I. 3. 8).",
    "32077": "Why has this aphorism been made, when by rule (III. I. 4), स्था would have taken क and by rule (III. 1. 75), it would have taken क्विप् also? This repetition is for the purpose of prohibiting the prohibition, that is to say, the _sutra_ (III. 2. 14) prohibited the _sutra_ (III. 2. 4), and the present _sutra_ removes that prohibition. Thus शंस्थः and शंस्थाः । But for this _sutra_, this form could not have been evolved; for, with the _upapada_ शम्, the verb स्था would have taken the affix अच् by (III. 2. 14).",
    "32078": "Thus उष्ण + भुज् + णिनि = उष्णभोजिन्, 1st. sing. उष्णभोजी 'who eats his meal hot'. So also शीतभोजी &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not mean a genus'? Witness ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयिता 'the inviter of _Brahmanas_'. We cannot form ब्राह्मणानामन्त्रयी\n\nWhy do we say 'when habit is to be expressed'? Witness उष्णं भुङ्क्ते कदाचित् 'he sometimes eats hot'.\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of the word '_supi_' was understood in this aphorism, its repetition here declares that _upasargas_ are not included. This is contested by the author of the _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_. According to him this affix comes even with _upasargas_. As अनुनायित्, अनुजीविन्, उपजीविन् &c.\n\nVart:- The verb आसृ in composition with the prepositions उत् or प्रति should be enumerated as taking this affix. As उदासारिन्, fem. उदासारिणी, 1st. plural उदासारिण्यः. So also प्रत्यासारिणी, pl. प्रत्यासारिण्यः ।\n\nVart:- So also when the sense is 'having skill in such and such action'. As साधुकारी 'excellent worker'; साधुदायी 'giving liberally'.\n\nVart:- So also after the verb वद preceded by ब्रह्म. As ब्रह्मवादिन्, in ब्रह्मवादिनो वदन्ति 'the knowers of _Brahma_ say'.",
    "32079": "Thus उष्ट्र इव क्रोशति = उष्ट्रक्रोशिन् 'who makes a noise like a camel'; ध्वाङ्क्षराविन् 'who makes a noise like a crow'.\n\nThis _sutra_ applies where 'habit' is not indicated : or where 'genus' is denoted in opposition to the last aphorism.\n\nWhy do we say 'when expressing the agent'? Witness as अपूपानिव भक्षयति माषान् 'he eats _masha_ like _apupa_'. Here अपूपा is object and not agent, and hence no composition takes place.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting a standard of comparison'? Otherwise there will be no composition. As उष्ट्रः क्रोशति 'the camel makes noise'. For the accents of these words, see (VI. 2. 80).",
    "32080": "The word व्रत means a 'vow' as regulated and ordained by the Scriptures. This condition 'when vow is expressed' applies to the completed word, that is to say, when the complete word made up of the root, the _upapada_, and the affix, denotes a vow. As स्थण्डिलशायिन् 'the vow of sleeping on bare ground (and nowhere else) or a person who has taken this vow'. अश्राद्धभोजिन् 'who has vowed not to eat during the performance of a _Sraddha_ ceremony.\n\nWhy do we say 'when vow is to be expressed'? Otherwise there is no composition. As स्थण्डिले शेते देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ sleeps on bare ground'.\n\nThis _sutra_ is also an exception to (III. 2 78) applicable when habit is not meant, or when genus is to be expressed.",
    "32081": "The word आभीक्ष्ण्य means continued repetition, that is to say, zealous practice or assiduous performance of anything, but does not mean habit. As कषायपायिणो गान्धाराः 'the people of _Gandhara_ are _kashaya_-drinkers'. कषाय + पा + णिनि = कषाय + पा + युक् + णिनि (VII. 3. 33). So also क्षीरपायिण उशीनाराः 'the people of _Usinara_ are milk-drinkers'. सौवीर-पायिणो बाह्लीकाः 'the people of _Bahlika_ are _sauvira_-drinkers'.\n \nBy using the word 'diversely' in the _sutra_, this affix is not applied in other places, as in the following :- कुल्माषखादः 'a grain eater'.",
    "32082": "The word '_supi_' is understood in this _sutra_. As दर्शनीयमानी 'who thinks himself handsome'; शोभनम्मानी 'who thinks himself beautiful'.\n\nThe verb मन् belonging to the 4th conjugation is taken here and not that belonging to the 8th conjugation; because the _anuvritti_ of the word 'diversely' is understood here. In the present aphorism, whether we take the _Divadi_ or _Tanadi_ मन् the resulting form would be the same, namely मानिन्. But not so in the next aphorism, where before the affix खश् there would be difference of form owing to the _vikarana_ i. e., in the 4th conjugation श्यन् would be added, but not so if the verb belonged to the 8th class.",
    "32083": "The word आत्ममान means thinking of one's own self. By the word 'and' it is meant that the affix णिनि may be employed in the same sense. This rule applies where the agent, indicated by the sense of the affix, thinks himself possessed of the qualities of 'handsomeness' &c., denoted by the _upapada_. As दर्शनीयम्मन्यः or दर्शनीयमानी 'who thinks himself handsome'; पण्डितम्मन्यः or पण्डितमानी 'who thinks himself learned'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when employed to signify thought whereof the object is self'? Witness दर्शनीयमानी देवदत्तस्य यज्ञदत्तः ' _Yajnadatta_ is thought handsome by _Devadatta_'.\n\nOf the affix खश् the letter ख् causes मुम् augment by (VI. 3. 66); and श् makes it a _sarvadhatuka_ affix, which brings in the proper _vikaranas_. The affixes so far treated of are applicable in all tenses. The others that follow denote some particular time.",
    "32084": "The phrase 'with the sense of past time' is an _adhikara_ or governing aphorism and exerts its influence up to aphorism 123 of this chapter; that is to say, these affixes give a signification of the past tense to the verb whose _anuvritti_ is also understood throughout the subsequent _sutras_; see (III. 1. 91).\n\nThus it will be taught in the next aphorism: 'after the verb यज्, when the word in composition is in the instrumental case, the affix णिनि is employed'. Here to complete the sense we must read into the _sutra_, the words 'with the sense of past time'. As अग्निष्टोमेनेष्टवान् = अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् 'who has sacrificed with an _Agnishtoma_ or a five-day series of offerings'.\n\nWhy do we say 'with the sense of past time' ? Otherwise these affixes will not be employed. As अग्निष्टोमेन यजति 'he sacrifices with _Agnishtoma_'.",
    "32085": "The _anuvritti_ of णिनि and not of खश् is to be read into this _sutra_. As अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् 'who has sacrificed with _Agnishtoma_. Here _Agnishtoma_ is the instrument for the attainment of the desired fruit.",
    "32086": "As पितृव्यघातिन् 'who has killed his paternal uncle'; मातुलघातिन् 'who has killed his maternal uncle'; हन् + णिनि = घन् + णिनि (VII. 3. 54) = घत् + णिनि (VII. 3. 32) = घातिन् (VII. 2. 116).\n\nThis affix is employed only when censure is implied. Therefore it is not employed in चोरं हतवान् 'he has killed the thief'.\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of the word कर्मणि of this aphorism extends up to _sutra_ (III. 2. 96).",
    "32087": "As ब्रह्महन्, 1st. sing. ब्रह्महा 'who has killed a _Brahmana_'; भ्रूणहा 'who has killed a foetus'; वृत्रहा 'who has killed _Vritra_, a name of _Indra_'.\n\nSince by _sutra_ 76 _ante_, the affix क्विप् was ordained to come after all verbs, and therefore would have come after the verb हन् also, where is the necessity of the present aphorism? This aphorism makes a _niyama_. i.e. the verb हन् takes the affix क्विप् only when it is in composition with the words ब्रह्म &c. Four-fold restriction is here intended.\n\n(1) When हन् has _upapada_, the words ब्रह्म &c., and not any other word; as पुरुषं हतवान् 'he has killed the man'.\n\n(2) When the words ब्रह्म &c. are _upapadas_ of any other verb than हन्, then this affix is not employed; so that the verb must be हन्; thus ब्रह्माधीतवान् 'he has read the _Veda_'.\n\n(3) The क्विप् is the only affix to denote past time in the case of हन् preceded by ब्रह्म &c., and no other affix can be employed in this sense.\n\n(4) This is employed only in the past tense and not in any other tense; as ब्रह्माणं हन्ति or हनिष्यति 'he kills or will kill the _Brahmana_'. This _sutra_ anticipates the diversity taught in the next _sutra_, and is an example of बहुलं use of the affix.",
    "32088": "This aphorism ordains क्विप् in cases which are not governed by the restrictive rule contained in the last aphorism. As मातृहा सप्तमं नरकं प्रविशेत् 'may the matricide enter the seventh hell'; so also पितृहा 'patricide'.\n\nDiversely we find also मातृघातः and पितृघातः।",
    "32089": "The phrase 'in the accusative case' is understood in this aphorism, and applies to all the above-mentioned words, except सु, which being an attributive word, of course, cannot take any case-terminations. As सुकृत् (VI. 1. 71) 'who has done well'; कर्मकृत् 'who has done all works'; पापकृत् 'who has committed sins'; मन्त्रकृत् 'who has made a mantra'; पुण्यकृत् 'who has done virtuous actions'.\n\nThis _sutra_ also ordains a restrictive rule or _niyama_. Three-fold restriction is intended here: namely, restrictions with regard to time, _upapada_, and affix; but not with regard to verbs. See (III. 2. 87). There being no restriction with regard to the root, this affix is employed when words other than these are _upapadas_. As, शास्त्रकृत् 'who has made Scriptures'; भाष्यकृत् 'who has made a commentary'. The त् is added to the root by (VI. 1. 71).",
    "32090": "As, सोमसुत् 'who has pressed the _soma_ juice, or _soma_-distiller'; 1st. dual सोमसुतौ; 1st. plural सोमसुतः ।\n\nThis _sutra_ is also for the sake of making a _niyama_ or restrictive rule. The four-fold restriction is here intended. i. e. as regards the verb, the tense, the _upapada_ and the affix.",
    "32091": "As, अग्निचित् 'one who has kept the sacred fire'; 1st. dual अग्निचितौ; 1st. plural अग्निचितः ।\n\nHere also, as in the last aphorism, four-fold restriction is intended.",
    "32092": "The words चेः and कर्मणि are understood in this _sutra_. The Name is expressed by taking the complete word consisting of the verbal root, the _upapada_ and the affix. As श्येनचित् 'a fire which has been arranged in the shape of a hawk'; कङ्कचित् 'fire arranged like a heron'.\n\nThe word आख्या indicates that these words are _rudhi_ words, their sense depending upon usage rather than etymology. The arrangement of bricks for sacrificial purpose with regard to fire, gets these various names; that is, when the bricks are arranged like a falcon, it is called श्येनचित्, and so on.",
    "32093": "The repetition of the word कर्मणि in the _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ might have been drawn from the last aphorism, indicates that when the object carries with it a sense of censure on the agent, then only this affix is employed and not with every and any object. As सोमविक्रयिन् 'the seller of _soma_ plant'; रसविक्रयिन् 'the seller of liquors'; employing disapproval of the action of those persons who carry on these mean professions. But not so in धान्यविक्रायः 'the seller of paddy'.",
    "32094": "As मेरुदृश्वन्, 1st. sing. मेरुदृश्वा 'who has seen the Meru'. परलोकदृश्वा 'who has seen the hereafter.'\n\nThough the affix क्वनिप् was valid by _sutra_ (III. 2. 75) its repetition here shows that no other affix comes in this sense after this verb.",
    "32095": "How can the verb युध्, which is an intransitive verb, govern an object ? It is a transitive verb, in as much as it is taken to be a causative verb, with the णिच् affix latent. As राजयुध्वन्,1st. sing. राजयुध्वा (VIII. 2. 7) 'who has caused the king to fight'; राजकृत्वन्, 1st. sing. राजकृत्वा (VI.1.71.) 'who has made a king'.",
    "32096": "The word सह, being a particle, and not denoting a substance, is incapable of taking any case. As सहयुध्वन् 'who has made to fight with'; सहकृत्वन् 'who has done any thing along with another'.",
    "32097": "As उपसरे जातः = उपसरजः । जन् + ड = ज् + अ (VI. 4. 143) = ज 'born of the first conception'; मन्दुरजः 'born in the stable'.",
    "32098": "As बुद्धिजः 'born through understanding'; संस्कारजः 'born of habit'; दुखजः 'born through pain'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not denoting a genus'? Observe हस्तिनो जातः 'born of elephant'; अश्वाज्जातः 'born of horse'.",
    "32099": "The term here being simply appellative, and not descriptive, cannot be explained by giving the signification of its component elements. As प्रजाः 'people', or 'a son'; as in the sentence अथेमा मानवी प्रजाः ।",
    "32100": "As पुमनुजा 'a girl born after the male child i. e. a girl having an elder brother'; स्त्र्यमनुजः 'a boy born after the female child i. e. a boy having an elder sister'.",
    "32101": "Thus the locative case has been dealt with in _sutra_ (III. 2. 97); but the affix comes when the _upapada_ has any other case than the seventh. As न जायते = अजः 'unborn'; द्विर्जातः = द्विजः 'twice-born'.\n\nThus, it is said in _sutra_ (III. 2. 98) that the _upapada_ may be in the ablative case, when genus is not denoted. We see, however, the affix employed when genus is denoted. As ब्राह्मणजो धर्मः; क्षत्रियजं युद्धम् ।\n\nIt is declared in _sutra_ (III. 2. 98) that when appellative is meant, the affix ड comes after the compound verb जन्. We find, however, the affix employed when the sense is not simply appellative; as अभिजाः or परिजाः 'born or produced all round i.e. hair'.\n\nIt is declared in _sutra_ (III. 2. 100.). 'When an object is in composition with the verb अनुजम् this affix is employed'. But it may also be employed when no object is in composition. As अनुजः 'born after i. e. younger brother'.\n\nThe force of the word अपि 'though' is to free this rule from all restrictions and conditions. So this affix comes after other verbs and other cases in composition with such verbs. As परितः खाता = परिखा 'a moat' (literally that which has been dug all round); आखा 'a pond'.",
    "32102": "The affixes क्त and क्तवतु are निष्ठा (I. 1. 26). As कृ + क्त = कृतम् 'made'; कृ + क्तवतु = कृतवत्,1st. sing. कृतवान् 'done'; so also भुक्तम् and भुक्तवान् 'eaten'.\n\nVart:- The _Nishtha_ affixes come when _adi_-_karma_ is meant. For a fuller description of what constitutes _adi_-_karma_ see _sutra_ (III. 4. 71), and the illustrations under it. Thus प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः, प्रकृतवान् कटं देवदत्तः ।",
    "32103": "As सु + ङ्वनिप् = सुत् + वन् (VI. I 71) = सुत्वन् 1st. sing. सुत्वा 'who has pressed out or extracted juice'; यज्वन्, 1st. sing. यज्वा 'who has sacrificed'. The त् is added by (VI. 1. 71). See _Rig_. _Ved_. (I. 3. 1).",
    "32104": "As जृ + अतृन् = जर् + अव् (VII. 3. 84) = जरत्, 1st. sing. जरन्, 1st. dl. जरन्तौ, 1st. pl. जरन्तः 'grown old' (VII 1. 70).\n\nBy the rule of वासरूप (III. 1. 94), the _Nishtha_ affixes also come after this verb. As जीर्णः and जीर्णवान् । जृ + क्त = जिर् + त (VII. 1. 100) and (I. 1. 51) = जिर् + न (VIII. 2. 42) = जीर्ण (VIII. 2. 77) and (VIII. 4. I) 'grown old'.",
    "32105": "As अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श 'I saw the sun from both sides'; अहं द्यावापृथिवी आततान 'I stretched the heaven and the earth'. Here the words ददर्श and आततान have the force of _nishtha_. See _Yaj_. _Ved_. (VIII. 9).\n\nWhy this separate _sutra_, when by aphorism (III. 4. 61), in the _Chhandas_ the _lun_, _lan_ and _lit_ come in all tenses ? That rule is made with regards to two or more verbs when in syntactical relation (धातुसम्बन्ध) with each other (III. 4. 1). The present rule is general, and without any such limitations.\n\n_Lit_ is the affix of the Present Perfect and will be fully treated of in the conjugation of verbs.",
    "32106": "As अग्निं चिक्यानः 'he consecrated the fire'; सोमं सुषुवाणः 'he pressed the _soma_ juice'. This being an optional affix, is sometimes not employed; as in the examples in the last aphorism.\n\nWhy has the word _lit_ been repeated in this _sutra_, when its _anuvritti_ could have been drawn from the last _sutra_ ? The substitute कानच् replaces not only the special लिट् of _sutra_ (III. 2. 105), but the general लिट् which comes after the roots in forming the perfect tense; so that the affix कानच् forms verbal adjectives as well as the perfect tense.\n\nThis affix comes after those verbs only which take _Atmanepada_ terminations. See (I. 4. 100). तूतुजान (_Rig_. _Ved_. (I. 3. 6)).",
    "32107": "As जक्षिवस् 1st. sing. जक्षिवान् 'eaten' (_Yaj_. (VIII. 19)); पपिवस् 1st. sing. पपिवान् 'drunk'.\n\nSometimes it does not come, as in the example under _sutra_ (III. 2. 105); अहं सूर्यमुभयतो ददर्श.\n\nThe division of this _sutra_ from the last, in which it could well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_, into which the _anuvritti_ of क्वसु only runs.",
    "32108": "This being a substitute only, the original affix लिट् also comes after these verbs. As, उपसेदिवान् कौत्सः पाणिनिम् '_Kautsa_ served _Panini_'. In the alternative, the proper affixes of the past tense will be employed. As उपासदत् 'he served'; उपासीदत् and उपससाद्.\n\nSo also अनूषिवान् कौत्सः पाणिनिम्. In the alternative we have अन्ववासीत्, अन्ववसत् and अनूवास.\n\nSo also उपशुश्रुवान् कौत्सः पाणिनिम्. In the alternative we have उपाश्रौषीत्, उपाश्रुणोत् and उपशुश्राव.  \n\nThe affix क्वसु is employed with the force of लुङ्, and लङ् also.",
    "32109": "These forms are thus evolved:- To the verb इ 'to go' with the preposition उप, the affix क्वसु is added: as उप + इ + क्वसु. The root is reduplicated: as उप + ई + इ + क्वसु. The reduplicate is here long ई by (VII. 4. 69). This long ई does not coalesce with the short इ by the rules of _sandhi_; for then the rule by which this ई was introduced would have no scope. Now we add the augment इट् contrary and in opposition to the rule (VII. 2. 67). and this is the irregularity. As उप + ई + इ + इट् + क्वसु. Then the root य is replaced by च by _sutra_ (VI. 4 81). As उप + ई + य + इट् + क्वसु = उपेयिवस् 1st. sing. उपेयिवान्. The augment इट् is however dropped in those cases (भ) where वस्, is changed into उप्; because the insertion of इट् was itself an exceptional case of limited scope:-  for while the general rules (VII. 2. 75) &c. ordained it, the special rule of (VII. 2. 67) prohibited it; and it was by prohibition of this prohibition that इट् was employed before वस्. Therefore in accusative plural we have उपेयुषः; instrumental sing उपेयुषा &c.\n\nThis irregular participle is not limited to the _upasarga_ उप; we find such irregular forms with other _upasargas_ and without them also; thus समीयिवान्, and ईयिवान् as well.\n\nBy the _anuvritti_ of the word वा read in this aphorism, we have लुङ् &c. in the alternative. As in Aorist उपागात्, Imperfect उपैत्, Perfect उपेयाव ।\n\nThe word अनाश्वान् is thus formed:- To the verb अश् 'to enjoy' we add the negative particle अन; apply the affix क्वसु and do not insert the augment इट्; So, we have अन + अश् + क्वसु = अनाश्वस् 1st. sing. अनाश्वान्. In the alternative we have Aorist नाशीत्, Imperfect नाश्नात् and Perfect नाश.\n\nThe word अनूचानः is thus derived:- The affix कामच् is added in expressing the agent to the verb वच् preceded by अनु. In the alternative we have Aorist अन्ववोचत्, Imperfect अन्वब्रवीत्, Perfect अनूवाच.",
    "32110": "The लुङ् forms what is known as aorist. It is in fact the name of the aorist, as the whole of this affix is replaced by other personal terminations. See (III. 1. 43) and subsequent _sutras_.\n\nThe aorist has reference to a past time indefinitely or generally, without reference to any particular time. An action done before today is expressed by the perfect or imperfect; whatever remains for the aorist is, therefore, to express a past action, done very recently, say, in the course of the current day or having reference to a present act. Aorist, therefore, merely implies the completion of an action at a past time generally, and also an action done at a very recent time, as during the course of this day. The imperfect and perfect are used in narrating events of past occurrence, generally in remote past time; the aorist is used in dialogues and conversations which refer to recent past actions, but it is not used to denote past specified time or to narrate events.-- _Apte_'s Composition. As अकार्षीत् 'he did'; अहार्षीत् 'he took'.\n\nVart:- The affix लुङ् comes after the verb वस् 'to dwell', when 'end of the present night' is indicated. Supposing a person rising from his bed at the proper time of rising (not in the middle of the night, but in the early morning) and finding another near him were to ask that one, 'where did you dwell i.e. pass the night'? That person so asked should answer in the लुङ् and not in लङ्. As अमुत्रावास्सम् 'I dwelt there'; and not अमुत्रावसम्.\n\nVart:- The above rule applies only in connection with waking after regular sleep. He who has not slept the whole night, but only for half an hour or so, should reply अमुत्रावसम्.",
    "32111": "The word अनद्यतन is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, meaning that which has not occurred during the course of the current day (_adyatana_). The whole of this affix is replaced by conjugational terminations, and the affix लङ् by itself denotes the Imperfect tense. As अकरोत् 'he did'; अहरत् 'he took'.\n\nWhy have we explained _anadyatana_ as a _Bahuvrihi_ compound? Because when there is a doubt as to the time, whether it was to-day or yesterday, there the Imperfect should not be used. As अद्य ह्यो वा अभुञ्ज्महि 'we ate to-day or yesterday'. In such a case the affix is लुङ्.\n\nVart:- The affix लङ् is also employed in signifying what is not witnessed by the narrator, when it relates to a well-known public event which can form the object of perception by the narrator. Thus in speaking of a recent public occurrence we may say :-अरुणद् यवनः साकेतम् 'the _Yavanas_ have besieged _Saketa_'; अरुणद् यवनः माध्यमिकान् 'the _Yavanas_ have besieged _Madhyamika_'.\n\nWhy do we say 'not witnessed by the speaker'? Observe उदगात् आदित्यः 'the sun arose'. Why do we say 'a popular public event' ? Observe चकार कट देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ has made the mat'. Why do we say 'which is the object of perception by the speaker'? Observe जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः '_Vasudeva_ killed _Kansa_'.",
    "32112": "The word अभिज्ञा means 'recollection'. This rule sets aside the affix लङ्. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामः 'rememberest thou, _Devadatta_, we were dwelling (lit. we will dwell) in _Kashmir_'.\n\nThe word वचन meaning 'signification' in the _sutra_, denotes that the construction is the same when the synonyms of अभिज्ञा are used; as स्मरसि 'dost thou remember'; बुध्यसे 'dost thou know'; चेतयसे 'dost thou reflect'; and the like.",
    "32113": "This prohibits लृट् which the verb वस् obtained from the last _sutra_. As अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत् कश्मीरेष्ववसाम 'thou rememberest _Devadatta_ how we did dwell in _Kashmir_'. Here the mere fact of dwelling is recollected, there being no other idea implied; therefore the subsequent aphorism has no scope here. That aphorism has its scope, when with recollection, is added another dependent idea or action, without which the sentence is not complete.",
    "32114": "The word साकाङ्क्षा means the relation between the sign and the thing signified, wished for or wanted by the speaker, or in other words, when the first verb is related to another verb used in the same sentence, as a sign is to that which is indicated by the sign. As अभिजानासि देवदत्तः कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः, तत्र सक्तून् पास्यामः or अभिजानासि देवदत्तः कश्मीरान् गच्छामः, तत्र सक्तून् पिबामः 'do you remember _Devadatta_ we went to Kashmir and there did drink _Saktu_'.\n\nThis option is allowed whether the particle यत् is or is not used. As अभिजानासि देवदत्तः यत् कश्मीरान् गमिष्यामः (or यत् कश्मीरान् गच्छाम,) यत् तत्रौदनं भोक्ष्यामहे (or यत् तत्रौदनमभुञ्ज्महि) 'Do you recollect, _Devadatta_ how we went to _Kashmir_ and how we ate rice there'.\n\nIn the above examples, the verb 'to go' is the sign, and the 'eating' or 'drinking', in the second sentence, is the thing really signified; the first verb is necessary as an introduction to the thought of the speaker which dwells more upon the second verb. Here the second sentence or proposition is used as completion or complement of the first proposition.",
    "32115": "The word परोक्ष 'unperceived' qualifies the words भूत 'past' and अनद्यतन 'non-current day' understood in this aphorism.\n\nWell, are not the senses of verbs all unperceived, since they are mere words, and words cannot be perceived ? Exactly so; but in popular phraseology, the perception is imagined to attach to the agent with regard to certain verbs; this rule relates to cases where such perception does not take place. As, चकार 'he did'; जहार 'he took'.\n\nIt is evident that the लिट् (perfect) should not be used in the first person, i. e. when the agent of the action is the speaker or writer himself; for it is impossible that the action should not have been witnessed by him. But if by reason of some distracted, unconscious or absent state of mind, it is possible for the agent to speak of the action as one, of which he was not a conscious witness, the perfect may be used even in the first person. As सुप्तोऽहं किल विललाप 'indeed I prated while asleep'.\n\nVart:- The perfect should be employed (in denoting past time simply, whether of the current day or otherwise, and whether the action has been witnessed personally or not) if the sense is total denial of the action. As कलिङ्गेषु स्थितोऽसि ? नाहं कलिङ्गम् जगाम 'did you live in the _Kalinga_ country ? I did not even go to the _Kalinga_ country'; दक्षिणापथं प्रविष्टोऽसि ? नाहं दक्षिणापथं प्रविवेश.",
    "32116": "The force of च 'and' is that the affix लिट् (perfect) may also be employed in similar construction. As इति हाकरोत् (imperfect), or इति ह चकार (perfect) 'Alas ! he did it'. शश्वदकरोत् or शश्वच्चकार 'again and again he did it'.",
    "32117": "This _sutra_ also qualifies the words भूत, अनद्यतन and परोक्ष understood in this _sutra_. The word प्रश्न means 'what should be asked'; and आसन्नकाल 'time close at hand': As, some one may ask another, अगच्छत् देवदत्तः, or जगाम देवदत्तः 'did _Devadatta_ go or has _Devadatta_ gone (just now)'? अयजद् देवदत्तः or इयाज देवदत्तः 'Did _Devadatta_ sacrifice or has _Devadatta_ sacrificed'?\n\nWhy do we say 'in asking question'? Otherwise there would be Perfect tense only. As, जगाम देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ has gone'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the past time referred to is imminently recent'? Observe भवन्तं पृच्छामि, जघान कंसं किल वासुदेवः 'I ask you, did _Krishna_ indeed kill _Kansa_ in days of yore'.",
    "32118": "All the words within brackets are understood in this aphorism. This debars लिट् or the perfect tense. Thus यजति स्म युधिष्ठिरः '_Yudhishthira_ sacrificed'; so also नलेन स्म पुराधीयते । उर्णया स्म पराधीयते ॥",
    "32119": "As एवं स्म पिता ब्रवीति 'thus said the father'; इति स्मोपाध्यायः कथयति 'thus said the preceptor'.",
    "32120": "The _anuvritti_ of the words '_anadyatana_' and '_paroksha_' does not extend to this _sutra_. This declares a rule with regard to past time in general. This debars लुङ् (the Aorist tense). As अकार्षीः कटं देवदत्त ? -- ननु करोमि भोः '_Devadatta_, did you make the mat? O, yes, I did make it'. अवोचस्तत्र किञ्चिद् देवदत्त,- - ननु ब्रवीमि भोः '_Devadatta_, did you speak there anything? O, yes, I did speak'.\n\nWhy do we say 'in reply to an interrogation'? Observe नन्वकार्षीन्  माणवकः 'certainly, _Manavaka_ did it'.",
    "32121": "As, अकार्षीः कटं देवदत्त -- न करोमि भोः or नाकार्षम्; -- अहं नु करोमि or अहं न्वकार्षम् '_Devadatta_, did you make the mat ? -- No I did not; --  what of that, I did'.",
    "32122": "The _anuvritti_ of the word _anadyatana_ which had come to a stop with (III. 2. 120) manifests itself again in this _sutra_ by a process of jumping over the two intermediate aphorisms. This sort of _anuvritti_ is technically called _manduka_-_pluti_ 'the leap of a frog' i. e. skipping of several _sutras_ and supplying a word from a previous _sutra_.\n\nThis is an optional rule, so that when _lat_ and _lun_ are not used, the proper tenses, as the case may be, must be employed. As वसन्तीह पुरा छात्राः 'the pupils lived here formerly'. So also, Aorist, अवात्सुः पुरा छात्राः; Imperfect, अवसन्निह पुरा छात्राः; Perfect, ऊषुरिह पुरा छात्राः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word स्म is not used'? Observe यजति स्म पुरा युधिष्टिरः '_Yudhishthira_ did perform a sacrifice formerly'. Here rule 118 _ante_ exerts its influence.",
    "32123": "The word वर्तमान means that which is begun and which has not yet come to an end. The action denoted by a verb in the present tense is yet continuing and has not stopped. As पचति 'he is cooking'; पठति 'he is reading'. So also whatever is constant, regular, uniform, is represented by the Present Indefinite. As तिष्ठन्ति पर्वताः 'the mountains stand'; स्रवन्ति नद्यः 'the rivers flow'.",
    "32124": "As पचमानं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold _Devadatta_ who is cooking'; पचता कृतम् or पचमानेन कृतम् 'done by one who is cooking'. पच् + शानच् = पच् + शप् + शानच् (III. 4. 113), (III. 1. 68) = पच् + अ + मुक् + आन (VII. 2. 82) = पचमान । So also पच् + शप् + शतृ = पच् + अ + अत् = पचत् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when agreeing with what does not end with the first case-affix' ? Observe देवदत्तः पचति '_Devadatta_ cooks'.\n\nSince the term लट् might have been supplied from the last aphorism, its double citation is for the sake of larger application of this rule; that is to say, this rule applies sometimes even when the word is in concord with a nominative case. As सन् ब्राह्मणः 'who is a _Brahmana_' = अस्ति ब्राह्मणः; so also विद्यते ब्राह्मणः and विद्यमानो ब्राह्मणः; जुहुत् and जुहोति; and अधीयानः and अधीते ।\n\nVart:- These affixes are employed after a verb, when the particle माङ् is in composition, and censure or curse is implied. As मा पचन् and मा पचमानः 'may he not cook'; मा जीवन् यः परावज्ञादुःखदग्धोऽपि जीवति  'cursed be he (lit. may he not live) who though smitten by the pain of the contempt of others, still lives'. Some commentators read the _anuvritti_ of the word 'option' from _sutra_ 121 into this. That option, however, is a limited option (_vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_) and not of universal application. Whenever a particular form is found as differing from the general form, there it should be understood that the option has been allowed, and not everywhere.",
    "32125": "This aphorism declares when these participles may be employed even in the first case; as हे पचन् or हे पचमान 'O thou who art cooking'.",
    "32126": "The word लक्षण means that by which a thing is recognised or known i. e. an attribute; हेतु means producer or cause. Both these words are attributes of the word क्रिया. Of _lakshana_:- as, शयानाः भुञ्जते यवनाः 'the _Yavanas_ take their meals lying down'. तिष्ठन्तोऽनुशासति गणकाः । Of _hetu_ :- as हरिं पश्यन् मुच्यते 'by (reason of) seeing _Hari_, he gets absolution'; अधीयानो वसति 'for the sake of study he dwells here'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting a characteristic or a cause'? Observe पचति 'he cooks'; पठति 'he reads'.\n\nWhy do we say 'of the action'? Not so when the participle is the characteristic or cause of a substance or a quality. As यः कम्पते सोऽश्वत्थः 'that which is shaking is the _Aswattha_'; यदुत्प्लवते तल्लभु 'whatever floats is light'; यन्निषीदति तद्गुरु 'that which sinks down is heavy'.\n\nVart:- This participle also defines the agent of an action as, योऽधीयान आस्ते स देवदत्तः 'he is _Devadatta_ who sits studying'.\n\nVart:- This participle is also used to state a general truth: as शयाना वर्धते दूर्वा 'the _Durva_ grass grows in a recumbent position'; आसीनं वर्धते बिसं 'a lotus stalk grows in an upright position'. The compound लक्षणहेत्वोः of the _sutra_ contradicts the rule by which a word of fewer syllables stands first (II. 2. 14). This shows that the rule (II. 2. 14.) is not universal.",
    "32127": "These participial affixes get collectively this name; and as such they are not limited by the conditions enumerated above; so that they replace not only the affixes of the Present tense but sometimes of Future also (III. 3. 14.), as well as other tenses. Thus ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वन्, करिष्यन्, कुर्वाणः, करिष्यमाणः ।\n\nThe word सत् occurs in _sutra_ (II. 2. 11.) &c.",
    "32128": "As पवमानः 'purifier (fire or air)'; यजमानः 'sacrificer'.\n\nIt might be asked 'is the शानन् with others that follow, an affix suo generis, or is it merely a substitute of ल, as शतृ and शानच् ? Why we ask this question is this. If they are affixes and not substitutes of ल, then they should govern genitive case by rule (II. 3. 65.) instead of nominative or the accusative. If, on the other hand, they are substitutes of ल, then by rule (II. 3. 69.) they should not govern the genitive case. But evidently they are not the substitutes of ल, as they are not so taught. How is it then that we have such forms as सोमं पवमानः 'drinking _Soma_'; and नडमाघ्नानः? These forms can be explained on other grounds than supposing that शानन् &c. must be the substitutes of ल. The term तृन् in _sutra_ (II 3. 69.) is not the affix तृन् taught in this Chapter _sutra_ 135; but it is a _pratyahara_ including several affixes. It is a _pratyahara_ formed by taking the तृ of शतृ in _sutra_ 124; and न् of तृन् in 135; and thus it means all the affixes from शतृ in 134 down to तृन् in 135. Thus though शानन्, चानश् &c. are not substitutes of ल, still the rule (II. 3. 69.) applies to them, as they are included in the term तृन्.\n\nVart:- The rule (II. 3. 69.) applies only optionally when the verb द्विष् takes the affix शतृ. As चोरस्य or चोरं द्विषन् 'hating the thief'.",
    "32129": "The word ताच्छील्य means 'habit' or 'disposition'; वयः means the condition of body such as 'infancy', 'youth' & c; शक्ति means 'capacity to do a thing'. As भोगं भुञ्जानः 'habituated to enjoy'; कवचं बिभ्राणः 'wearing an armour (of the age at which armour may be worn)'; शत्रुं निघ्नानः 'able to destroy his foe'. So also, कतीह मुण्डयमानाः, भूषयमानाः, कवचं पर्यस्यमानाः, शिखण्डं वहमानाः and पचमानाः।",
    "32130": "The word अकृच्छ्र means that which is accomplished by the agent with ease and facility. As अधीयन् पारायणम् 'the facile reading of the _Purana_'; धारयन्नुपनिषदम् 'easily mastering the _Upanishad_'. The root धारि is causative of धृ and means here 'to master'.\n \nWhy do we say 'when facility is indicated'? Otherwise कृच्छ्रेणाधीते 'he reads with difficulty'; कृच्छ्रेण धारयति 'he remembers with difficulty'.",
    "32131": "The word अमित्र means 'enemy'. As द्विषन् 'enemy', द्विषन्तौ 'two enemies', द्विषन्तः 'enemies'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an enemy'? Observe द्वेष्टि भार्या पतिम् 'the wife hates her husband'.",
    "32132": "The word यज्ञसंयोग is an instrumental compound, meaning association or connection (संयोग) with sacrifice. As सु + नु + शतृ (III. I. 76), (III. 4. 113) = सुनु+ अत् (I. 2. 4.) = सुन्वत् (VI. I. 77), Ist. sing. सुन्वन्, Ist. pl. सुन्वन्तः 'the sacrificers'; as in सर्वे सुन्वन्तः 'all are interested in, or partake of, or share in the sacrifice'.\n\nThe word संयोग indicates that the principal sacrificer. i.e. the यजमान is meant and not every person who is associated in the performance of a sacrifice in a subordinate capacity; such as याजकाः 'the sacrificing priests'.\n\nWhen connection with sacrifice is not meant we have the सुनोति सुराम् 'he distils liquor'.",
    "32133": "As अर्हन्निह भवान्विद्याम् 'thou art worthy of this knowledge here'; अर्हन्निह भवान्पूजाम् 'thou art worthy of honor in this place'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to praise' ? Witness अर्हति चौरो वधम् 'the thief deserves death'.",
    "32134": "The force of आ in this _sutra_ is limit inclusive, and includes क्विप् also. The term तच्छील means 'the natural inclination towards an action not prompted by a contemplation of its fruit or result'. The term तद्धर्म means 'who enters upon an action not from habit but thinking that it is his duty'. The term तत्साधुकारि means 'who does the action expressed by the verb in an excellent way'. Illustrations of these will be given under the subsequent aphorisms.",
    "32135": "The न् of तृन् is indicatory, and regulates the accent (VI. 1. 197). As कृ + तृन् = कर्तृ, Ist sing. कर्ता. This affix denotes habit in the following; as, कर्ता कटान् 'who is accustomed to make mats'. Nature:- as, मुण्डयितारः श्राविष्ठायना भवति वधूमूढाम् 'the family of _Sravishtayana_ shave the heads of their widows'; अन्नमपहर्तार आह्वरका भवन्ति श्राद्धे सिद्धे 'the _Ahvarakas_ steal away food as soon as _Sraddha_ is accomplished'; उन्नेतारस्तौल्वलायना भवन्ति पुत्रे जाते 'the _Taulvalayanas_ become elated on the birth of a son'. Skill:- as, कर्त्ता कटम् 'skilful maker of mats'. गन्ताऽऽखेटम् 'skilful hunter'.\n\nVart:- The simple verbs, without _upasargas_, take the affix तृन्, when the words so formed are names of sacrificial priests. As हु + तृन् = होतृ, Ist. sing. होता 'the _Hotri_ priest'; so also पोतृ 'the _Potri_ priest'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not taking the _upasargas_'? Observe उद्गातृ 'the _Udgatri_ priest'; प्रतिहर्तृ 'the _Pratihartri_ priest'. Here the affix is तृच्. Though the form is the same, there is difference however in the accent; i.e. तृन् places _udatta_ accent on the first syllable (VI. I. 197), while तृच् places it on the last (VI. 1. 163).\n\nVart:- The augment षुक् is added when नी takes the affix तृन्; as नी + षुक् + तृन् = नेष्टृ, Ist. sing. नेष्टा 'the _Neshtri_ priest'.\n\nVart:- When signifying diety, the verb त्विष् takes तृन्; the letter अ is the substitute for the इ of the root; and the affix does not take the intermediate इट् augment; as, त्विष् + तृन् = त्वष्टृ, Ist. sing. त्वष्टा '_Tvashtri_'.\n\nVart:- The root क्षद takes तृन्, when the word to be formed means an officer; as क्षतृ 'an attendant, a door-keeper'.\n\nVart:- In the _Veda_, the root क्षद takes तृच्, as क्षतृ. The form is the same as the last, but there is difference of accent.",

    "32137": "The Causatives take this affix in the Vedic literature. As दृषदं धारयिष्णवः 'who hold the stones'; वीरुधः पारयिष्णवः ।",
    "32138": "Thus भविष्णुः 'becoming'.\n\nThe _yoga_-_vibhaga_ or the division of this _sutra_ from the last, with which it could well have been read, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_.\n\nThe word 'also' indicates the existence of other verbs not included in the above two _sutras_; as, भ्राजिष्णुना लोहितचन्दनेन ।",
    "32139": "As, ग्लास्नुः 'languid'; जिष्णुः 'victorious'; स्थास्नुः 'disposed to stand firm, immoveable'; भूष्णुः 'being'.\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of the word _Chhandasi_ does not extend to this _sutra_. The indicatory letter of this affix is really ग and not क, and therefore, there is no substitution of long ई for the आ of स्था, which would otherwise have taken place, had the affix been कित् (VI. 4. 66).\n\nIn the _sutra_ (l. 1. 5.) (क्ङिति च) the letter ग is also included; for ग coming before क, is changed by the rules of _sandhi_ into क and is not therefore visible. This affix therefore does not cause _guna_.\n\nSo also in _sutra_ (VII. 2. II) (श्रयुकः किति), the augment इट् does not come after the verb स्नु, or a monosyllabic verb ending in the _pratyahara_ उक, when an affix having an indicatory क follows. Here also क includes ग; and therefore in भूष्णु we have no intermediate augment इट्.\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_ this affix comes after the verb दंश 'to bite'; as दङ्क्ष्णवः पशवः 'the beasts that bite'.",
    "32140": "As, त्रस्नुः 'trembling'; गृध्नुः 'greedy'; धृष्णुः 'bold'; and क्षिण्नुः 'throwing'.",
    "32141": "The word इति in the aphorism indicates beginning. These eight verbs begin with शम् and end with मद in the list of verbs. Of the affix घिनुण् the real affix is इन्, the other letters are servile; the घ is for the sake of substituting guttural for the final palatals; उ is for the sake of euphony, or for the sake of rule (VI. 3. 45); and the letter ण् causes _vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 116): which in the case of roots ending in म is prohibited by the rule (VII. 3. 34), the only verb taking '_vriddhi_' being मद् ।\n\nAs शमिन् Ist. sing. शमी 'calm'; likewise तमी 'desiring'; दमी 'taming'; श्रमी 'laborious'; भ्रमी 'whirling', 'moving round'; क्लमी 'fatiguing'; क्षमी 'forbearing'; प्रमादी 'mad' and उन्मादी 'mad'. Though by rule 136, the verb उन्मद takes the affix इष्णुच्, it also takes the affix घिनुण् by the rule of वाऽमरूप (III. 1 94).\n\nAll these verbs belong to the _Divadi_ class. After other verbs than these eight, we have other affixes; as असिता.",
    "32142": "The root सम्पृच् is to be taken as belonging to the _Rudhadi_ class, and not as belonging to _Adadi_, because the _vikarana_ is elided in the latter. The root परिदेव belongs to _Bhvadi_ class, the simple verb being देवृ 'to sport'. The verb क्षिप् 'to throw' is common both to _Tudadi_ and _Divadi_, and both are taken here. युज् 'to concentrate' is _Divadi_, and युज् 'to join' is _Rudhadi_; both are meant here. The verb रञ्ज् 'to color' has lost its nasal in this _sutra_, irregularly.\n\nThus सम्पृच् + घिनुण् = सम्पर्क + इन् (VII. 2. 52) = सम्पर्किन् Ist. sing. सम्पर्की 'mixture'; similarly, अनुरोधी 'compliant'; आयामी 'one who restrains'; आयासी 'one who exerts'; परिसारी 'that which flows round'; संसर्गी 'united'; परिदेवी 'lamenting'; संवारी 'greatly heating'; परिक्षेपी 'moving about'; परिराटी 'crying aloud'; परिवादी 'reviling'; परिवाही 'burning'; परिमोही 'beguiling'; दोषी 'guilty'; द्वेषी 'hating'; द्रोही 'quarrelling'; दोही 'milking'; योगी 'uniting or concentrating'; आक्रीडी 'playing'; विवेकी 'discriminating'; त्यागी 'renouncing'; रागी 'yearning after'; भागी 'sharing'; अतिचारी 'transgressing'; अपचारी 'offending'; आमोषी 'a thief'; अभ्याघाती 'attacking'. (VII. 3. 52) and (54).\n\nThe indicatory घ of the affix shows that the final palatal is changed into a corresponding guttural before this affix.",
    "32143": "As विकाषी 'injuring'; विलासी 'sportive, a sensualist'; विकत्थी 'vaunting'; and विस्रम्भी 'confiding'.",
    "32144": "As अपलाषी 'thirsty'; विलाषी. The term वि is to be read into this _sutra_ by the force of the word 'and'.",
    "32145": "As प्रलापी 'prattling'; प्रसारी 'extending around'; प्रद्रावी 'running away, fugitive'; प्रमाथी 'tormenting'; प्रवादी 'reporting'; प्रवासी 'a traveller'.\n \nThe root वस् here is the _Bhvadi_ वस् meaning 'to dwell' and is not _Adadi_ meaning 'to cover', because in the latter the _vikarana_ is elided.",
    "32146": "In this _sutra_ the whole phrase ending with असूय has taken the termination of the first case; which, however, has the force of the ablative here.\n\nAs निन्द् + वुञ् = निन्दकः (VII. I. I) 'blaming'; so also हिंसकः 'injuring'; क्लेशकः 'tormenting or troublesome'; खादकः 'eating'; विनाशकः 'destroying'; परिक्षेपकः 'surrounding'; परिराटकः 'who cries aloud'; परिवादकः 'a plaintiff'; व्याभाषकः 'detracting'; and असूयकः 'detracting'.\n\nThe same forms as the above would have been obtained by adding the affix ण्वुल taught in (III. 1. 133), as by adding वुञ्; its separate enunciation indicates the existence of this _paribhasha_ :-\n\n\"The rule of (III. 1. 94) by which an _apavada_-affix which is not uniform with an _utsarga_-affix should supersede the latter only optionally, has no concern with _apavada_-affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit' i. e. with the affixes taught in (III. 2. 134-177)\". Therefore the affixes तृच् &c, are not added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'.",
    "32147": "As आदेवकः 'one who sports or laments'; आक्रोशकः 'vociferous, a reviler'; परिदेवकः 'one who laments'; परिक्रोशकः 'a reviler'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when in composition with an _upasarga_'? Observe देवयिता and क्रोष्ठा formed by तृन् (III. 2. 135).",
    "32148": "As, चल् + युच् = चलनः 'moving' (VII. I. 1); चोपनः 'creeping'; शब्दनः 'sounding'; रवणः 'roaring'.\n\nWhy do we say 'intransitive'? Observe पठिता विद्याम्.",
    "32149": "As वर्त्तनः 'being'; वर्द्धनः 'growing'.\n\nWhy do we say '_Anudattet_'? Observe भविता.\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe एधिता, which though _Atmanepadi_, takes तृन्.\n\nWhy have we used the term आदि 'beginning' in the _sutra_? Observe जुगुप्सनः 'censuring'; मीमांसनः 'an investigator'. For without the word आदि, the rule would have stood thus:- अनुदात्तेतश्च हलः which by (I. I. 72.) would mean 'the affix युच् comes after the verbs which end with a consonant'; so that even after एध् we shall have युच्; and there would be no युच् after जुगुप्स which ends with a vowel.\n\nThis rule will not apply if the root is transitive; as वसिता वस्त्रं ।",
    "32150": "The verb जु is not to be found in the _Dhatupatha_, and is taught in the aphorisms and is hence called a _sautra_ _dhatu_. It means 'to go', 'to be quick'. As जु + युच् = जो +अन (VII. 1. 1.) and (VII. 3. 84) = जवनः (VI. I. 78), (II. 3. 46) 'a courser, a swift horse'. चङ्क्रम्य + युच् = चङ्क्रम् + अन् (II. 4. 74) = चङ्क्रमनः 'moving about'; so also दन्द्रमणः 'wandering'; सरणः 'flowing'; गर्द्धनः 'greedy'; ज्वलनः 'burning'; शोचनः 'grieving'; लषणः 'desiring'; पतनः 'falling'; पदनः 'moving'.\n\nThe enumeration of the word पद in the above, indicates that this _sutra_ applies to the transitive verbs; otherwise the _sutra_ (III. 2. 148) would have been sufficient, as पद is a चलनार्थ verb. Others say that the inclusion of पद् in this aphorism indicates the existence of the _paribhasha_ already given under _sutra_ (III. 2. 146) i.e. the rule of (III. 1. 94) has no concern with affixes added in the sense of 'having such a habit &c'. The affix इष्णुच् which by (III. 2. 136) is added to अलङ्कृतम्, supersedes therefore not merely the addition of तृन् to अलङ्कृतम् (III. 2. 135), but also the addition of ण्वुल् to the same. If a _tachchhilika_ _apavada_ were to supersede only an _atachchhilika_ _utsarga_, it would have been superfluous for _Panini_ to teach in this _sutra_ the addition of युच् to पद्, because in that case the addition of युच् to पद् by (III. 2. 154) would not have debarred the addition of युच् to पद् by (III. 2. 149). The repetition is for the sake of _jnapana_, therefore, and it indicates the existence of the above-mentioned maxim. The _jnapaka_ is not, however, of universal application; for sometimes both affixes are applied concurrently; as, गन्ता खेटं विकत्थनः ।",
    "32151": "As क्रोधनः 'wrathful'; रोषणः 'irascible'; मण्डनः 'adorning'; भूषणः 'ornament'. But not so after the verb अलङ्कृ to which _sutra_ (III. 2. 136) applies.",
    "32152": "This debars (III. 2. 149). As क्नूयिता 'making creaking sound'; क्षमायिता 'trembling'. In these cases the affix तृन् is employed (III. 2. 135).",
    "32153": "These three verbs are _anudattet_, and by _sutra_ (III. 2. 149), would have taken युच्. The present _sutra_ prohibits that. Therefore they take तृन्. As, सूदितृ Ist. sing सूदिता 'one who strikes'; दीपितृ 'one who shines'; दीक्षितृ 'one who initiates'.\n\nNow, it might be objected-- \"We find that _sutra_ (III. 2. 167) specifically enjoins the affix र after दीप्; this _apavada_ rule will therefore, supersede the general rule; where is then the necessity of the present rule? If you say that the affix युच् is also obtained by the rule of non-uniformity (III. 1. 94), we reply that the _Paribhasha_ given under _sutra_ 146 and 150 will prevent that.\" This objection is answered by saying that the above-mentioned _Paribhasha_ is not of universal application; there are exceptions to it, as कम्रा युवतिः and क्रमना युवतिः 'a young girl' which are both valid forms derived by adding र and युच् to the verb कम्. So also कम्प्रा and कम्पना शाखा 'a shaking branch'.\n \nIf we prohibit युच् after the root सूद, how do we get the forms मधुसूदन and रिपुसूदन ? This objection may be answered in three ways: (1) the present is an _anitya_ rule, not of universal application, which can be inferred from finding this _sutra_ separated from the last (_yogavibhaga_), when it was easier to make them one, (2) the words मधुसूदन &c belong to the मन्दादि class (III. I. 134) taking the affix ल्यु or (3) they are formed by (III. 3. 113) by the affix ल्युट्.",

The हन् is changed into घात् by (VII. 3. 32) and (54).",
    "32155": "The ष is indicatory showing that the feminine of the words so formed take the affix ङीष् i. e. long ई (IV. 1. 41). As जल्पाकः 'talkative'; भिक्षाकः 'a beggar'; कुट्टाकः 'who or what cuts'; लुण्टाकः 'a thief or robber'; वराकः 'low, miserable'. In the feminine जल्पाकी &c.",

    "32158": "The word निद्रा is formed by adding the preposition नि to the verb द्रा 'to go crookedly'; so also तन्द्रा is formed by adding तद् to द्रा, and then irregularly changing the द् into न्. The term श्रद्धा is formed by adding श्रत् to the verb डुधाञ् 'to hold'. The first three verbs belong to _Churadi_ class and take णिच्.\n\nAs, स्पृहयालुः 'disposed to be desirous of'; गृहयालुः 'disposed to catch hold of or seize'; पतयालुः 'tending or prone to fall'; दयालुः 'compassionate'; निद्रालुः 'disposed to sleep'; तन्द्रालुः 'slothful'; श्रद्धालुः 'full of faith'. See (VI. 4. 55) for adding अय ।\n\nVart:- The affix आलुच् comes also after the root शीङ् 'to lie down'; as शयालुः 'disposed to lie down'.",
    "32159": "As, दारुः 'munificent man'; धारुर्वत्सो मातरम् 'a sucking child of the mother'. The genitive case is here prohibited by (II. 3. 69), the रु being taken as equivalent to उ. As सरुः 'binding'; शद्रुः 'falling'; and सद्रुः 'resting'.",
    "32160": "As सृमरः 'going, a kind of deer'; घस्मरः 'gluttonous'; अद्मरः 'voracious'.",
    "32161": "As भञ्ज् + घुरच् = भङ्ग् + डर (VII. 3. 52) = भङ्गुरः 'brittle'; the palatal being changed into guttural, because of the indicatory घ. So also मेदुरः पशुः 'a fat beast'; भासुरं ज्योतिः 'splendid light'.\n\nAfter the verb भञ्ज् this affix gives a reflexive signification-- that which naturally breaks of itself.",
    "32162": "As विदुरः पण्डितः 'a knowing _Pandit_'; भिदुरं काष्टम् 'a splitting or fragile wood'; छिदुरा रज्जुः 'a cutting or breaking rope'. The affix is employed in a reflexive sense after the verbs भिद and छिद.\n\nVart:- The affix कुरच् comes after the verb व्यध 'to kill'; and there is vocalisation of the semivowel; as विधुरः ।",
    "32163": "The प् is indicatory in order to introduce the augment तुक् between the verb and the affix (VI. I. 71). Thus इ + क्वरप् = इ + त् + वर = इत्वरः, fem. इत्वरी 'a traveller'; नश्वरः, fem. नश्वरी 'transitory'; जित्वरः, fem. जित्वरी 'victorious'; सृत्वरः fem. सृत्वरी 'going, a river'.\n\nThough the affix begins with a letter of वल् _pratyahara_, and ought to have taken the intermediate इट् (VII. 2. 35) yet it is prohibited by (VII. 2. 8).",
    "32164": "The word गत्वर is formed by eliding the म् of गम् and adding the affix क्वरप्. As गत्वरः, fem. गत्वरी 'locomotive, transient'.",
    "32165": "As जागरूकः 'wakeful'.",
    "32166": "The intensives of these verbs take ऊक. As यायजूकः 'a performer of frequent sacrifices'; जञ्जपूकः 'a mutterer of prayers repeatedly'; दन्दशूकः 'a snake (what bites frequently)'.",
    "32167": "Thus, नम्रं काष्ठं 'soft wood'; कम्प्रा शाखा 'shaking branch'; स्मेरं मुखं 'smiling face'; अशस्त्रं जुहोति 'he sacrifices perpetually'; कम्रा युवती 'a beautiful maiden'; हिंस्रं रक्षः 'the injuring _Rakshas_'; दीप्रं काष्ठं 'brilliant wood'.\n\nThe word अजस्रं is an adverb, and is derived from the root जस् 'to set free', with the negative particle अ, and the affix र; as अ + जस् + र = अजस्रं ।",
    "32168": "The term सन् in the aphorism means Desideratives in the affix सन्, and not the verb, सन् because the verb सन् is never seen with this affix.\n\nAs, चिकीर्षुः 'desirous of doing'; जिहीर्षुः 'desirous of taking'; आशंसुः 'desirous'; भिक्षुः 'a beggar'.\n\nThe verb आशंस् with the _upasarga_ आ is the verb शसि 'to desire' and not the verb शंसि 'to praise'.",
    "32169": "To the verb विदि we add the augment नुम् and then the affix उ; as, विद् + नुम् + उ = विन्दुः (I. I. 47) वेदनशीलः 'intelligent'; so of इष् 'to wish', the ष is replaced by छ, and we have इच्छुः = एषणशीलः 'desirous'.",
    "32170": "The affix उ comes in the _Chhandas_, after the roots that have taken the Denominative affix क्य in the sense of 'the agent having such a habit &c'.\n\nThe term क्य includes the three affixes क्यच्, क्यङ् and क्यप् (see _sutras_ (III. I. 8), (II. 13), &c). As मित्रयुः, संस्वेदयुः, सुम्नयुः (_Rig_. _Ved_. I. 3. 4).\n\nIn the modern Sanskrit तृन् will be employed. As मित्रीयिता. By _sutra_ (VII. 4. 33), the long ई replaces the final अ, when क्यच् follows; as पुत्र + क्यच् =  पुत्री + य = पुत्रीय. Why then in the case of मित्रयुः there is not the substitution of long ई for the अ of मित्र ? Because the rule (VII. 4. 33) is set aside by (VII. 4. 35) which declares that in the _Chhandas_ the long ई is not substituted for the अ ।",
    "32171": "The द् after आ is either for the sake of euphony, or for the sake of precision. Had it been त्, then by the rule of तपर (I. 1. 70) short ऋ would only be included and not long ॠ. But the present rule is applicable to long ॠ as well.\n\nThus पा + कि = पपिः 'drinking'; as पपिः सोमं  'drinking the _soma_-juice'; ददिर्गाः 'giving cows' (_Rig_. _Ved_. VI. 23. 4). मित्रावरुणौ ततुरिः (_Rig_. _Ved_. IV. 39. 2, VI. 68. 7). दूरे अध्वाजगुरिः (_Rig_. _Ved_. X. 108. I). गम् + किन् = जग्मिः 'being in constant motion, wind'; जग्मियुवा (_Rig_. _Ved_. II. 23. 11); हन् + किन् = जघ्निः ‘killing, a weapon offensive'; जघ्निवृत्रम् (_Rig_. _Ved_. IX. 61. 2); जन् + किन् = जघ्निः as जज्ञिबीजम् (T.S. VII. 5. 20. I).\n\nThe letter क् in these affixes is indicatory. It might be said 'it is superfluous to make these affixes कित्, because these being treated like लिट् will be कित् by rule (1. 2. 5)'. True, they would be कित् by the rule (I. 2. 5), but then the rule (VII. 4. 11). (when _lit_ follows, _guna_ is the substitute of the verb ॠच्छ and of those that end in the long ॠ) would also have applied to these affixes, and would have caused _guna_. It is to prevent this _guna_ of the letter ॠ that we have annexed an indicatory क to these affixes.\n\nVart:- The affixes कि and किन् are of universal application in the _Chhandas_, and not confined to the verbs enumerated in the _sutra_, as we see them in सद् &c.; as सेदिः (_Yaj_. _Ved_. XII. 105); नेमिः (_Rig_. _Ved_. II. 5. 3).\n\nVart:- The affixes कि and किन् come after the roots धाञ्, कृञ्, सृ, जमि, गमि, and नमि in the secular literature also; as, दधिः, चक्रिः, सस्रिः, जज्ञिः, जग्मिः ,नेमिः ।\n\nVart:- The affixes कि and किन् come after the Intensive (यङन्त) roots of सह्, यह्, चल् and यत्. As, सासहिः, वावहिः, चाचलिः, यायतिः (VII. 4. 83).",
    "32172": "The affix नजिङ् comes, in the sense of 'the agents having such a habit &c', after the verbs स्वप् 'to sleep' and तृष 'to be thirsty'.\n\nAs स्वप् + नजिङ् = स्वप्नज् Ist. sing. स्वप्नक् 'sleeping, drowsy'; तृष्णज् Ist. sing. तृष्णक् 'covetous, thirsty'.\n\nVart:- So also after the verb धृष् 'to insult, be bold'; as, धृष्णज् Ist. sing. धृष्णक् 'bold, impudent'.",
    "32173": "As शरारुः 'noxious, a mischievous animal'; वन्दारुः 'praising, a bard'.",

    "32176": "With the affix यङ्, the intensives of verbs are formed; as यायावरः 'a vagrant, an ascetic'. See _sutra_ (I. 1. 58).",
    "32177": "Thus, विभ्राज् Ist. sing. विभ्राट् 'splendid'; भास् Ist. sing. भाः 'light'; धुर्व् + क्विप् = धुर् (VI. 4. 21), Ist sing. धूः 'who injures'; विद्युत् 'lightening'; ऊर्ज Ist. sing. कर्क् 'strength'; पुर् Ist. sing. पूः 'what fills'; जूः 'swift'. In the case of जु, a long vowel is the substitute of जु; ग्रावस्तुत् (VI. I. 71) 'a stone-worshipper'. Though by the universal rule (III. 2. 76), the affix क्विप् would have come after these verbs also, the repetition of the affix shows that वाऽसरूपविधि does not apply in _tachchhilika_ affixes.",
    "32178": "As युज्, Ist. sing. युक् 'joining'; छित् 'piercing'; भित् 'dividing'.\n\nBy using the words 'is seen' in the aphorism, it is implied that other rules also apply concurrently with क्विप्. Thus in some cases we find lengthening of the vowel; in some, there is reduplication of the root; in some instances there is _samprasarana_ of the semivowel; and in other cases there is not.\n\nVart:- When क्विप् follows, the long vowel is the substitute of वच् 'to speak', प्रच्छ् 'to ask', आयतस्तु 'to praise long', कटप्रु 'to move through a mat', जु 'to move rapidly', and श्री 'to serve', and there is no substitution of a vowel for the semivowel (VI. 1. 16).\n\nAs, वाक् 'the voice'; प्रच्छ् + क्विप् = प्रश् + क्विप् (VI. 1. 10) = प्रष् + क्विप् (VIII. 2. 36) = प्राट् (VIII. 4 56) 'who asks'; आयतस्तूः 'who praises long'; कटप्रूः 'a worm'; जूः 'swift'; श्रीः 'the goddess _Lakshmi_'.\n\nThe word जु which was mentioned in the last _sutra_ is redundant here.\n\nVart:- There is reduplication of the verbs द्युत् 'to shine', गम् 'to go' and हु 'to invoke', when क्विप् follows. As, विद्युत् 'shining'; जगत् 'going, the world'.\n\nVart:- There is lengthening also of the vowel of जुहुः as जुहूः 'a crescent-shaped wooden ladle used for pouring the sacrificial ghee into the fire'.\n\nVart:- The root टृ 'to tear' is shortened also; as दटृत् 'tearing'.\n\nVart:- The verb ध्या 'to think' has _samprasarana_; as धीः 'thinking'.",
    "32179": "As, विभूः 'a person called _Vibhu_'; प्रतिभूः 'a surety i. e. he who stands intermediate between the debtor and the creditor'.",
    "32180": "As विभुः 'all pervading'; प्रभुः 'lord'; सम्भुः 'Creator'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it is not a proper name'? Observe विभूः 'a person called _Vibhu_'.\n\nVart:- The words मितद्रु &c, also are formed by this affix. As मितद्रु 'the sea'; शम्भुः 'causing happiness'.\n\nWhy have we applied डु and not क्विप् to this root, as the forms would have been the same in either case? We have done so for two purposes: (1) To prevent the rules relating to _dhatus_ from applying to this. (2) To prevent the insertion of तुक् augment. Thus the Ist. dual of मितद्रु is मितद्रू, Ist. pl. is मितद्रवः । Here there is no substitution of उकङ् which the rule (VI. 4. 77) required, if द्रु had retained its _dhatu_ characteristic; so also this rule of accent in (VI. 1. 175) does not apply to Instrumental sing. मितद्र्वा &c, (2.) We have no त् which rule (VI. I. 71) required. मितं द्रवति = मितद्रुः ।",
    "32181": "The indicatory ष denotes that the feminine is formed by ङीप् (ई) affix. As धात्री 'a nurse whom the children suck (_dhayanti_)'; and '_Amalaki_ fruit which holds (_dadhati_) all medicinal properties'.",
    "32182": "As दात्र, Ist. sing. neuter दात्रम् 'a sickle' (lit. that with which one cuts); नेत्र Ist. sing. नेत्रम् 'eye'; शस्त्रं (VII. 2. 9) 'a weapon'; योत्रं 'the tie that fastens the yoke'; योक्रम् 'the tie of yoke'; स्तोत्रं 'a penegyric'; तोत्रं 'a goad', सेत्रं 'a ligament'; सेक्रं 'a sprinkling vessel'; मेड्ढ्रम् 'the penis'; पत्रम् 'a vehicle'; दंष्ट्रा 'a large tooth'.\n\nThe word दंष्ट्रा belongs to the _Ajadi_ class and hence forms its feminine in टाप् (आ) and not in ई (IV. 1. 4).\n\nThe root दंश is read in the aphorism without its nasal i e. as दश्. This indicates by implication that दश् loses its nasal before some affixes such as ल्युट्; thus we have दशनम् 'tooth'\n\nAnd lastly नह् + ष्ट्रन् = नद्ध्र fem. नद्ध्री (VIII. 2. 34) and (40), 'a thong'.",
    "32183": "The verb पू includes both पूङ् and पूञ् as पोत्रम् 'a plough-share'; पोत्रमे 'the snout of a hog'.",
    "32184": "Thus, अरित्रं 'a rudder'; लवित्रं 'a sickle'; धवित्रं 'a fan'; सवित्रं 'cause of production'; खनित्रं 'a spade'; सहित्रं 'patience'; चरित्रं 'an instituted observance or a narrative'.",
    "32185": "The verb पू includes two verbs पूङ् and पूञ् both meaning 'to purify', but belonging to two different conjugations; as पवित्रं an instrument for cleansing or purifying, such as a sieve or a strainer; and in this sense it means 'two blades of _Kusa_ grass used at sacrifices in purifying and sprinkling _ghee_'. It also means 'the sacred thread, the clarified butter, &c'.",
    "32186": "That is to say, when applied to a _Rishi_ the force is that of an instrument, and when applied to a _Devata_ the force is that of an agent. As, पवित्रोऽयमृषिः 'this sage is sacred' (through whose instrumentality one is sanctified); अग्निः पवित्रं स मा पुनातु 'the God _Agni_ is sacred' (one that purifies), 'let him purify me'. So also, वायुः सोमः सूर्य इन्द्रः पवित्रं ते मा पुनन्तु ।",
    "32187": "The _Nishtha_ affix क्त, as a general rule, is a past participial affix and denotes past time; and is so ordained by rule (III 2.102). The present _sutra_ thus makes an exception in case of those verbs which are marked with an indicatory ञि in the _Dhatupatha_; as ञिमिदा 'to be affectionately inclined'; मिन्नः (मिद् + क्त = मिङ् + त = मिन् + न (VIII. 2. 42) 'being affectionately inclined'. So ञिक्षिवदा – क्ष्विणः 'sounding inarticulately'; ञिधृषा – धृष्टः 'bold'. The _anuvritti_ of वर्तमाने 'in the sense of the present', is read into this _sutra_ from (III. 2. 123).",
    "32188": "The word मति means 'wish' or 'desire'; बुद्धि means 'knowledge'; and पूजा means 'worship', 'honor' or 'respect'. As राज्ञां मतः, - इष्टः, -बुद्धः, -ज्ञातः, -पूजितः, &c. 'the king wishes, desires, thinks, knows, honors, respects &c'.\n\nThe force of the word च is to include other kinds of verbs not included in the above _sutra_. Thus the following participles have their senses confined not to the past time only: शीलितः 'practised'; रक्षितः 'protected'; क्षान्तः 'forbearing'; आक्रुष्टः 'censured'; जुष्टः 'pleased'; रुष्टः 'angry'; रुषितः 'angry'; अभिव्याहृतः 'uttered'; तृष्टः 'happy'; तुष्टः 'satisfied'; कान्तः 'favourite'; संयतः 'restrained'; उद्यतः 'ready'; कष्टं 'evil, misery' (with a future signification); and अमृत 'immortal. So also :- सुप्तः 'sleeping'; शयितः 'lying down'; आशितः 'eaten'; लिप्तः 'smeared'; तृप्तः 'satisfied'; all these have a present signification.",
    "33001": "The phrase 'with the force of the present' (implying neither past nor future time) and 'with a sense simply appellative' (and not descriptive) must be read into this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from _sutras_ (III. 2. 123) & (III. 2. 185). By using the word 'diversely' it is indicated that these affixes are, of course, applied after roots about which they are ordained, but they come also after roots about which they are not ordained. Sometimes we must infer their application by seeing actual words. Some affixes, though there be no express injunction regarding them, are to be inferred to belong to this class. The maxim in regard to the _Unadi_ affixes is that when, in appellatives, we find the forms of verbal roots and affixes coming after them, then we may know, from the result as presented in the word, what are the indicatory letters which the affix must be possessed of in order to produce the result.\n\nThese affixes are not given in _Panini_'s work, but they have been separately collected. The affix उण् is the first of these. The first _sutra_ of _Unadi_ affixes is the following-\n\nकृवापाजिमिस्वदिसाध्यशूभ्य उण् ॥\n\nThe affix उण् comes after the verbs कृ 'to make', वा 'to blow', पा 'to drink', जि 'to overcome', नि 'to scatter', स्वद 'to be pleasant to the taste', साध् 'to accomplish', and अश् 'to pervade'.\n\nThus कृ + उण् = कारुः 'an artisan'. So also, वायुः 'the wind'; पायुः 'the organ of excretion'; जायुः 'a drug (which overcomes disease)'; मायुः 'the bile'; स्वादुः 'sweet'; साधुः 'who accomplishes the object of another, hence virtuous'; and आशुः 'quickly'.\n\nThese _Unadi_ affixes come after a limited number of roots, and not after every root, as the affixes taught in this grammar whose application is general; hence the word बहुल has been employed. Moreover there has been no exhaustive enumeration of the several roots after which these affixes come: only some of them have been collected in works treating of _Unadi_ affixes. Thus though the affixes उलच् is ordained after हृष, it comes also after शक as शङ्कुला. In fact there is a long discussion and it was a moot point at the time of _Panini_ whether these words said to be formed by _Unadi_ affixes were really derivative, or primitive ones. Moreover all the operations of these affixes have not been shown, that is their effects are not without remainder (सशेष). They are valid and good if found in sacred Scriptures or secular literature. The authors of _Niruktas_ and grammarians of the school of _Sakatayana_, consider all nouns and substantives (नाम) as derivative words from simple roots (धातुज). Therefore where the derivation of a word is not apparent, one should infer the existence of proper base (प्रकृति) or affix (प्रत्यय) to form such a word.\n\nThe following slokas will be of some use to the student for ascertaining the _Unadi_ affixes.\n\nबाहुलकं प्रकृतेस्तनुदृष्टेः प्रायसमुच्चयनादपि तेषाम् ।\nकार्यसशेषविधेश्च तदुक्तं नैगमरूढिभवं हि सुसाधु ॥ १ ।\nनाम च धातुजमाह निरुक्ते व्याकरणे शकटस्य च तोकम् ।\nयन्न पदार्थविशेषसमुत्थं प्रत्ययतः प्रकृतेश्च तदूह्यम् ॥ २ ॥\nसञ्ज्ञासु धातुरूपाणि प्रत्ययाश्च ततः परे ।\nकार्याद्विद्यादनूबन्धमेतच्छास्त्रमुणादिषु ॥ ३ ॥",
    "33002": "By the last _sutra_, it was taught that the _Unadi_ affixes come with the force of the present time. The present aphorism teaches that they come with the force of the past also, not as a general rule, but in special cases. The force of the words 'are seen' being that no general rule can be laid down about it, but on finding that certain words have a past significance, we conclude that the affix in that particular case has the force of the past time.\n\nThus वृत् + मनिन् = वर्त्मन् 'a way, road' (that which has been established as a rule); चर् + मनिन् = चर्मन् 'skin' (that which is lived in); so also भस्मन् 'ashes' (that which has been reduced to ashes).",
    "33003": "The force of the future time is in the affix, and is so ordained, and not in the original word which takes the affix. Thus we see that the _Unadi_ affixes, in a way, do come with the force of not only present, but past and future also, though in the latter two cases its scope is very limited. As गमी ग्रामम् 'intending to go to the village'; आगामी 'that which has to come' So also प्रस्थायी 'departing'; प्रतिरोधी 'an opponent', (who is going to obstruct). प्रतिबोधी 'going to be awakened'. So also प्रतियोधी 'an adversary'; प्रतियोगी 'an enemy'; प्रतियायी; आयायी; भावी, &c.\n\nVart:- The Future, for the purposes of this rule, must be _anadyatana_ future i. e. the affix should come in the sense of what will happen but not in the course of the current day. In other words, the force must be of the first future लुट्, and not of the second future लृट्. As श्वो गमी ग्रामम् 'he intends to go to the village tomorrow'.",
    "33004": "The present tense has the force of the future when the adverbs यावत् and तावत् are used. The phrase 'futurity &c' is to be read into this _sutra_ from the last. Thus आलोके ते निपतति पुरा 'he will surely fall in the range of your sight'. यावदस्य दुरात्मनः समुन्मूलनाय शत्रुघ्नं प्रेषयामि. 'I shall send _Satrughna_ to exterminate this wretch'.\n\nThese words पुरा and यावत् must be used as adverbs (_nipatas_), and not as relative pronouns. Therefore not here, यावद् दास्यति तावद् भोक्ष्यते 'as long as he will give, so long he will eat'; पुरा ब्रजिष्यति 'he goes along the city'. Here यावत् is a relative pronoun; and पुरा is the Instrumental singular of पुर् 'city'.",
    "33005": "As कदा भुङ्क्ते 'when will he eat', or कदा भोक्ष्यते or भोक्ता; so also कर्हिभुङ्क्ते or भोक्ष्यते or भोक्ता 'when will he eat'.",
    "33006": "The word 'optionally' is understood in this _sutra_. By using the word वृत्त along with किं it is meant that the rule applies even when किम् takes the affixes डतर and डतम. The word लिप्सा means 'the desire of gaining or acquiring, a wish to have something or an intention of begging'.\n\nAs कं भवन्तो भोजयन्ति or भोजयितारः 'whom will you feed'? It implies a request on the part of the questioner to feed him also. So also कतरो भिक्षां दास्यति, ददाति, दाता, or कतमो भिक्षां दास्यति &c, 'Which of the two or which of these all, will he give alms? Will he give something to me'?\n\nWhen no desire of gain is implied, the future tense must be employed as कः पाटलीपुत्रं गमिष्यति 'who will go to _Pataliputra_'.",
    "33007": "The word 'optionally' is also understood here. The word लिप्स्यमानसिद्धिः is equal to लिप्स्यमानात् सिद्धि, an Ablative-_Tatpurusha_ Compound, signifying _siddhi_ or success, that would be acquired by another by complying with the request of the speaker. The difference between this and the last _sutra_ is, that whereas the last related to interrogative sentences having किम् in construction, the present relates to sentences in general. As यो भक्तं ददाति, स स्वर्गं गच्छति 'he who gives food, goes to heaven'; यो भक्तं दास्यति or दाता, स स्वर्गं गमिष्यति or गन्ता.\n\nHere the speaker encourages the giver to the act of charity by holding out the hope, that from rice which is the object desired (लिप्स्यमान) the success (सिद्धि), in the shape of _svarga_, will accrue to the giver.\n\nIn other words, 'the present is sometimes used for the future in conditional sentences, i.e., it is employed in connection with a sentence declaring the compensation or reward which follows from the granting of the wish'.",
    "33008": "The word लोडर्थ means 'having the sense of the affix लोट् or imperative mood'. The force of _lot_ is 'to command, direct, invite &c' as given in (III. 3. 162) and (III. 3. 163). The _sutra_, translated literally, will mean 'the present tense may optionally be employed when the action denoted by the verb is related to another action denoted by another verb in the imperative, as a sign (लक्षण) is to the thing signified (लक्ष्य)'. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छति (आगमिष्यति or आगन्ता) अथ त्वं छन्दोऽधीष्व 'if the professor comes (i.e. will come) then read you prosody'. Here the coming of the professor is the _lakshana_ of the direction as to reading.",
    "33009": "All the conditions of the last _sutra_ apply here also, namely 'when the action denoted by the verb is related to another action denoted by another verb in the imperative, as a sign is to the thing indicated'. By force of the word च we read the _anuvritti_ of _lat_ also into this aphorism. The word ऊर्ध्वमौहूर्त्तिक is a secondary derivative from ऊर्ध्वमुहूर्त्त, meaning 'that which exists in time above a _muhurta_'. This is an irregular compound; and the _vriddhi_ takes place irregularly of the उ of मु and not of ऊ as the general rule required. The whole word thus formed qualifies the word 'future'. Thus ऊर्ध्वं मुहूर्त्तादुपरि मुहूर्तस्य उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छेत् (आगच्छति, आगमिष्यति or आगन्ता), अथ त्वं छन्दोऽधीष्व 'If the teacher comes after an hour (of 48 minutes), you had better read the Prosody'.",
    "33010": "As भोक्तुम् व्रजति 'he goes to eat'; भोजको व्रजति 'he goes to eat'. Here the _upapada_ or the verb in construction is व्रजति; it denotes an action performed for the sake of the future action (क्रियार्था), namely, eating.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting an action'? The _upapada_ must be an action and not a substantive; as भिक्षिस्ये इति अस्य जटाः 'matted hair is for the purpose that he should beg.' Here the affixes are not employed.\n\nWhy do we say 'performed for the sake of another action'? Observe धावतस्ते पतिष्यति दण्डः 'running, thy stick will fall'.\n\nNow, it might be asked why ण्वुल् is taught a second time, when it was already taught generally by rule (III. 1. 133); and that being a common rule, would have applied to this subject also? If you reply that the future affix लृट् would have prevented its application, in conditional sentences like the above, we say that the rule of 'non-uniform affixes applying simultaneously' given in (III. 1. 94) will step in and will conduce the application of ण्वुल् in spite of लृट्.\n\nVart:- The repetition of the affix ण्वुल् (ordained to come after a verbal root, when the word in construction therewith is another verb denoting an action performed for the sake of the future action,) is for the sake of prohibiting the application of the affixes like तृच् &c. in denoting the above sense; that is to say, the rule of वाऽसरूप (III. 1. 94) does not apply here and we cannot optionally employ any other affix, with this gerundial sense. Thus we cannot say कर्त्ता व्रजति 'he goes to do'; but we must say कर्तुम् instead.\n\nThese affixes form the gerund of the infinitive of purpose.",
    "33011": "As पाकाय व्रजति 'he goes to cook'; भूतये व्रजति 'he goes for the sake of success'; पुष्टये व्रजति ।\n\nNow it might be asked, why make this rule at all, when those affixes have already been ordained? It has already been said that the वाऽसरूप rule does not apply in regard to infinitive; and hence तुमुन् would have prevented the application of other affixes. So the making of the present _sutra_.\n\nWhy the word वचन has been employed in the _sutra_ ? The meaning is that the words should be expressive or वाचक. How do the affixes become वाचक ? When affixes which are ordained after certain bases, are employed after those bases only, then they are said to be वाचक, not when they are employed after other bases, or are even after those bases, but not in the mode as directed. So that, in short, those nouns only which have been especially formed by the भाववाच्य affixes, घञ् &c, can be employed with the force of gerund, and not every noun. The भाववाच्य nouns correspond to the nouns of action or verbal nouns.",
    "33012": "The word 'future' is understood here. The force of च is merely that of a connective particle. By rule (III. 2. 1.) the affix अण् comes after a root when the word in composition is in the accusative case. That is a general injunction; and the rule of वाऽसरूप not applying, the affix ण्वुल would have debarred it as already said; hence this repetition. This rule being an _apavada_ rule (an exception or a special rule with regard to those verbs which have the accusative case in composition) will thus, within its own jurisdiction, prevent the application of ण्वुल् of (III. 3. 10); and by the rule of परत्व given in (I. 4. 2), it will debar the affixes like क &c. Therefore this अण् comes after even those verbs also which were especially exempted from its operation by rules like (III. 2. 3). Thus by rule (III. 2. 3) the अण् of (III. 2. I) could not have come after simple verbs ending in long आ, such as दा 'to give' &c. But the present अण् with a gerundial force will come even after such verbs. As गोदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give cows', and not गोदः । So also कम्बलदायो व्रजति 'he goes to give blanket'; अश्वदायो व्रजति । दा + अण् = दायः (VII. 3. 33).\n\nSo also काण्डलावो व्रजति 'he goes to cut wood'. In this case अण् would have been applied even by (III. 2. 1).",
    "33013": "This is what is well-known as the Second Future. As करिष्यामि इति व्रजति 'he goes that I will do'; हरिष्यामि इति व्रजति 'he goes that I will take'. So also, करिष्यति 'he will do'; हरिष्यति 'he will take'. Thus the Second Future is used both in dependent sentences as well as to denote simple Future.",
    "33014": "The सत् has been defined in (III. 2. 127). This option is a regulated option; that is to say, the affixes शतृ and शानच् replace लृट् under the conditions in which they replace लट्; thus by (III. 2. 124), these affixes will replace लृट् when agreeing with what does not end with the first case-affix. In these cases सत् will invariably replace लृट्. In other cases it will optionally replace लृट्. In these cases they will form what is known as future participles. As करिष्यन्तं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold _Devadatta_ about to do'; करिष्यमाणं देवदत्तं पश्य 'behold _Devadatta_ being about to be done'. हे करिष्यन् or हे करिष्यमाण. Besides simple futurity, it denotes intention or purpose, as अर्जयिष्यमाणो वसति 'he dwells intending to earn his livelihood'; करिष्यमाणः सशरं शरासनं 'intending to furnish his bows with arrows'.\n\nWhen, however, it agrees with the nominative case, it is optionally employed. As करिष्यन्, करिष्यमाणः, करिष्यति or करिष्यते देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ will do'.\n\nThe form करिष्यन् is thus evolved. As कृ + लृट् = कृ + स्य + लृट् (III. 1. 33) = कर + इट् + स्य + शतृ = करिष्यत् nom. sing. करिष्यन् । In other words the participial affixes अत् (अन्त) and मान, technically known as शतृ and शानच्, also come after a verb that has taken the personal ending स्य of the Future.",
    "33015": "This debars '_Lrit_'. As श्वः कर्ता 'he will do tomorrow'. श्वो भोक्ता 'he will eat tomorrow'.\n\nThe word '_anadyatana_' is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound. Therefore in cases where there is not pure futurity beyond today, but a mixture of the two, लृट् will be employed and not लुट्. As अद्य श्वो वा भविष्यति 'it will be today or tomorrow'. And where there is doubt, the second Future should be employed.\n\nVart:- The First Future (लुट्) is employed with the force of the Second Future (लृट्) when sorrow is expressed. As इयं तु कदा गन्ता, यैवं पादौ निदधाति । 'Oh when will she go, who places her feet in such a way (who is such a slow walker)' अयं तु कदाऽध्येता, य एवमनभियुक्तः 'when will he learn, who is so inattentive' !",
    "33016": "The _anuvritti_ of 'future' does not extend to this _sutra_. The affixes hereinafter taught come in all the tenses.\n\nAs पद + घञ् = पादः 'foot'; रुज् + घञ् = रोगः 'disease'; so, वेशः 'entrance'.\n\nVart:- The verb स्पृश् takes घञ् when the sense is that of 'distress'; as स्पर्शः 'disease' or 'warmth'. The word स्पर्श meaning 'touch' is formed by adding the affix अच्, under rule (III. 1. 134); as स्पर्शो देवदत्तः । There is difference in accent between these two words.",
    "33017": "The word स्थिर means an object remaining steady throughout any period of time. That which thus remaining permanent moves through any interval of time, will apply to the agent of the verb. Thus, सृ + घञ् = सारः 'an essence'; as चन्दनसारः 'the essence of sandal', खदिरसारः 'the essence of catechu'.\n\nWhy do we say 'permanently fixed'? Observe सर्त्ता 'moves', सारकः 'that which flows'.\n\nVart:- The word so formed also applies to disease, fish and strength. As अतिसारः 'dysentery'; विसारः 'a fish'; सारः 'strength'.",
    "33018": "Thus, पच् + घञ् = पाकः 'cooking' (VII. 2. 116) and (VII. 3. 52); त्यागः 'abandoning'; रागः 'colouring' (VI. 4. 27). An action expresses a general state; so that all roots denote 'action' when their meaning is to be expressed. And as the meaning of the root can be expressed by the root itself, therefore, the affixes घञ् &c. come after all verbal roots, when the sense of the root is denoted as having attained to the completed state. It is not necessary that the words so formed should be always of the masculine gender, singular number. They may take any other gender or number. As पक्तिः, पचनम्, पाकौ, पाकाः । These affixes form, in short, verbal nouns, or abstract nouns being names of action.",
    "33019": "Thus प्रासः (i.e. प्रास्यन्ति तम्) 'a dart, lit. that which men throw'; प्रसेवः (i.e. प्रसीव्यन्ति तम्) 'a sack, lit. that which men stitch together'; आहारः (i.e. आहरन्ति अस्माद्रसम्) 'food, lit. that from which men take out the juice to nourish themselves'. As मधुराहारः, तक्षशिलाहारः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'not related as an agent'? Observe मेषः 'a sheep, lit. that which looks helplessly'. Here the word मेष is related to the verb मिषति as agent, and the affix is consequently not घञ्.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an appellative'? Observe कर्तव्यः कटः 'the mat must be made'.\n\nThe force of च in the _sutra_ is to indicate that घञ् may be applied irregularly in cases where appellative is not meant: as को भवता दायो दत्तः 'what gift was given by you'; को भवता लाभो लब्धः 'what gain was gained by you'.\n\nThe word कारक is used in the _sutra_ for this purpose. The word अकर्तरि is a compound word formed by the negative नञ्. The word means a non-agent. Now the word 'non-agent' has two-fold significance; either it means any other _karaka_ which is not an agent-_karaka_; or it may mean any thing in general which is not an agent. That is to say, the former negative, called पर्युदास, points out, by implication, the objects which are different from the thing prohibited; and in fact, makes the rule applicable to those objects, while the second sort of negative called प्रसज्य प्रतिषेध is a simple prohibition of the particular matter specified, without mentioning what is different from it. Giving the former interpretation to the word अकर्तरि, the word कारक becomes redundant, because 'non-agent' would mean any _karaka_ other than an agent. But the very fact, that कारक is used, indicates the existence of the following rule which is nowhere expressly taught by _Panini_ :-That नञ् is compounded even with the force of प्रसज्य प्रतिषेध. (VI. I. 45). अशित्, non-'_sit_'.\n\nBoth the phrases, 'when denoting mere condition (भाव)' and 'a _karaka_' 'which is not an agent' are understood in the succeeding aphorisms. See (II 2. 6) about नञ् Compound.",
    "33020": "Thus, नि + चि + घञ् = निचै + अ (VII. 2. 115) = निचाय (VI. 1. 78) 'a heap'; as एकस्तण्डुलनिचायः; द्वौ शूर्पनिष्पवौ । कॄ 'to scatter' + घञ् = कारः । द्वौ कारौ; त्रयः काराः ।\n\nBy using the word 'all' in the _sutra_, it is indicated that the affix अप् (III. 3. 57) is also superseded when this sense is to be indicated. Otherwise the affix अच् would only be prohibited by the _Paribhasha_:-\"_Apavadas_ that precede the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the _apavada_-operations, supersede only those rules that stand nearest to them, not the subsequent rules\". Thus अच् being taught in (III. 3. 56) would be superseded, but not so अप् taught in the subsequent aphorism (III. 3. 57).\n\nWhy do we say 'when they are the names of measures'? Observe निश्चयः 'ascertaining'.\n\nThe word आख्यः has been used in the aphorism in order to indicate that the words so formed are not Primitive words (रूढि). The numerals are also there included, and not only measures like _Prastha_, _Pala_ &c.\n\nWe have said above, that the force of the word सर्वेभ्यः in this _sutra_ is to indicate that the affix घञ् must be used after all verbs (not excluding even such verbs as require अच् or अप् by _sutras_ 56 and 57), when we want to express measure. This must be taken however, with certain limitations. The word सर्वेभ्यः is not after all so wide as at first sight it may appear. If we wish to form a word indicating measure, in the feminine gender, we cannot use घञ्; we must use the affix क्तिन् (III. 3. 94). In other words, the feminine affixes are not superseded by घञ् when it supersedes अच् and अप्. Thus in forming a feminine noun denoting measure, we have एकातिलोच्छित्तिः, द्वे प्रसूती &c.\n\nVart:- The affix घञ् comes after the causative verbs दारि and जारि, and there is _luk_ elision of the causative affix णिच्; when the word so formed is related to the verb as agent. Thus दारयन्ति भ्रातॄन् = दाराः 'a wife' (lit 'who divides brothers' a wife breaking up the brotherly love); जारयन्ति = जाराः 'a paramour'.",
    "33021": "This debars अच् (III. 3. 56). As अधि+ इ + घञ् = अधि + ऐ + अ = अध्याय 'a lesson or lecture'; उपाध्यायः (उपेत्यास्मादधीते) 'a teacher'.\n\nVart:- When the word to be formed is related to the verb इङ् as an ablative, the word is feminine also and optionally takes the affix ङीष्. As उपेत्याधीयतेऽस्या = उपाध्याया or उपाध्यायी 'a female teacher'.\n\nVart:- The affix घञ् comes after the root शॄ when the word so formed means 'wind', 'color', or 'cessation'. As शारः 'wind', 'green colour' &c. गौरिवाकृतमीशारः प्रायेण सिशिरे कृशः ।",
    "33022": "This debars अप् (III. 3. 57). As संरावः 'clamour', उपरावः &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'compounded with an _upasarga_'? Observe रवः 'sound'.",
    "33023": "As संयावः, सन्द्रावः, सन्दावः । But प्रयवः where the preposition is not _sam_.",
    "33024": "This debars the affix अच् (III. 3. 56). As श्रायः 'shelter', नायः 'a means', भावः 'a condition'.\n\nBut with _upasargas_, we have प्रश्रयः 'respect', प्रणयः 'love'; प्रभवः ‘source'.\n\nHow do we explain the form प्रभाव in प्रभावो राज्ञः 'the splendour of the king'? Here the word प्रभाव is not made from the compound root प्रभू + घञ्, but by compounding प्र with भाव by the rules of _samasa_, meaning 'excellent condition'.\n\nHow do you explain the form नय in नयो राज्ञः ? Here the root नी has taken the affix अच् diversely by (III. 3. 113).",
    "33025": "This debars the affix अप् (III. 3. 57); as, विक्षावः 'cough'; विश्रावः 'flowing forth', 'celebrated'. But when without preposition, we have क्षवः and श्रवः ।",
    "33026": "As अवनायः 'throwing down'; उन्नायः 'elevation'.\n\nHow do you explain उन्नयः in उन्नयः पदार्थानाम् ? Here the affix is '_ach_' by (III. 3. 113).",
    "33027": "As प्रद्रावः, प्रस्तावः, प्रस्रावः। But not so in द्रवः, स्तवः and स्रवः ।",
    "33028": "The word पू refers to both पूङ् and पूञ्. The rule (I. 3. 10.) must be applied here, and thus निर् comes before पू, and अभि before लू । As निष्पावः 'winnowing'; अभिलावः 'moving'. But पवः and लवः, without these prepositions.",
    "33029": "The verb गृ here refers to both the verbs गृ 'to make sound', and गृ 'to swallow'. As उद्गारः समुद्रस्य 'the roaring of the sea'; निगारो देवदत्तस्य 'the swallowing of _Devadatta_'. But when without these prepositions, we have गरः ।",
    "33030": "The verb कॄ here means 'to scatter', and not 'to injure', because no words formed by this affix are found in Sanskrit in that sense.\n\nAs उत्कारो धान्यस्य 'the winnowing of corn'; निकारो धान्यस्य  the winnowing of corn'. But when not referring to grain, we have भैक्षवोत्करः 'a heap of alms', पुष्पनिकरः 'the essence or heap of flowers'.",
    "33031": "As संस्तावश्छन्दोगानाम् 'the _Sanstava_ of the _Chhandogas_'; संस्ताव (= समेत्य स्तुवन्ति यस्मिन् देशे छन्दोगाः स देशः) means 'the place which the _Brahmanas_ repeating hymns and prayers, occupy at a sacrifice'.\n\nBut when not referring to sacrifice we have संस्तवश्छात्रयोः 'the praising together of the two pupils'.",
    "33032": "As, शङ्खप्रस्तारः 'a bed of conch'; मणिप्रस्तारः 'strewing of gems'.",
    "33033": "The word प्रथनं means 'extent, circuit, range'. As पटस्य विस्तारः 'the extension of the garment'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning extent'? Observe, तृणविस्तरः 'a collection of grass'. Why do we say 'not referring to words'? Observe विस्तरो वचसाम् 'prolixity of words'.",
    "33034": "The word छन्द here means prosodial metre such as _Gayatri_ & c; and not the Vedas; otherwise the word नाम would not have been used. Thus वि + स्तृ + घञ् = वि + स्तृ + घञ् (VIII. 3. 94) = विष्टारः 'the name of a metre called _Vishtara_-_Pankti_'.\n\nThe whole word विष्टारपङ्क्ति is the name of a metre, and is not a word ending with the affix _ghan_; only a member of this word, i.e. the first part ends with _ghan_. The seventh case-affix in the word छन्दोनाम्नि has the force of location i.e. when the word so formed occurs in a portion of a name of a metre; it is not the full name, but it is in the name i.e. forms a portion of the name.",
    "33035": "This debars the affix अप्. As उद्ग्राहः 'lifting up'.\n\nVart:- In the Vedas this affix is applied even when the word  ग्रह is preceded by नि; and the ह is changed into भ; the sense of the two words being 'to lift up' and 'throw down' respectively of the sacrificial ladle; as, उद्ग्राभं च निग्राभं च ब्रह्मदेवा अवीवृधन् ।",
    "33036": "The word मुष्टि means 'boxing', 'fist'; as, अहो मल्लस्य सङ्ग्राहः 'O! the clenching of the fist of the athlete'; अहो मुष्ठिकस्य सङ्ग्राहः 'O! the seizing of the boxer', meaning grasping firmly.\n\nWhy do we say 'referring to fist'? Observe सङ्ग्रहो धान्यस्य 'a collection of grain'.",
    "33037": "Here again we take help of (I. 3. 10) in interpreting this _sutra_. The verbs परि + नी and नि + इ, take घञ् when respectively meaning 'gambling' and 'fitness'. As परिणायेन शारान् हन्ति 'he kills (or takes) many pieces by moving a chessman.' Here परिणायेन = समन्तान्नय means 'the moving of chess-pieces from every side, and so winning the game'. So also नि + इ + घञ् = नि + ऐ + अ = नि +  आय = न्यायः 'justice', 'propriety', 'logic'.\n\nBut when not having these senses, we have परिणयः 'marriage', and न्ययं 'decay'; as न्ययङ्गतः पापः 'the sin has been destroyed'. The word अभ्रेष means पदार्थानामनपचारो यथापापकरणम् ।",
    "33038": "As पर्यायः 'turn, succession'; तव पर्यायः 'thy turn'; मम पर्यायः 'my turn'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning turn'? Observe कालस्य पर्ययः 'the lapse of time'. The word अनुपात्ययः क्रमप्राप्तस्यानतिपातः 'not breaking the series or order'.",
    "33039": "As, तव विशायः 'thy turn of sleeping' (i.e. the rest enjoyed in rotation by the sentinels on watch); मम विशायः 'my turn of rest'; तव राजोपशायः राजानमुपशयितुम्पर्यायः 'thy turn of sleeping the king'.\n\nWhy do we say 'regular succession'? Observe उपशयः 'lying by the side of or ambush'; विशयः 'doubt'.",
    "33040": "By saying 'taking by hand' the close proximity of the person taking to the thing accepted or taken is indicated. As पुष्पप्रचायः 'gathering flowers by hand'; फलप्रचायः 'gathering fruits by hand'.\n\nWhy do we say 'taking by hand'? Observe वृक्षाग्रस्थानां फलानां यष्टया प्रचयं करोति 'he gathers with the stick the fruits hanging on the top of the tree'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not meaning to steal'? Observe पुष्पप्रचयश्चौर्येण 'the gathering of flowers by theft'.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the word उच्चयः 'gathering', as पुष्पोच्चयः 'gathering of flowers by hand'.",
    "33041": "That in which people dwell (निवसति) is called निवासः or 'dwelling'. That which is gathered together (चीयते) is called चिति or 'funeral pile'. शरीर means the body of all living beings; and उपसमाधान means making a heap. Thus निकाय 'a dwelling'; as in काशीनिकायः '_Kasi_-dwelling'; आकायमग्निं चिन्वीत 'let him arrange the _akaya_ fire i.e. the funeral fire'; कायः 'body', as अनित्यः कायः 'a perishable body'; महान् गोमयनिकायः 'a heap of cow-dung'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when having these senses'? Observe चयः 'gathering'. Why is not this rule applied in महान् काष्ठनिचयः 'a large heap of wood'? Here multiplicity is expressed and not collection or aggregation.",
    "33042": "The word सङ्घ means a collection or assembly of living beings. It is of two sorts:- either by collection of persons possessing common qualifications, or a mere confused crowd of men. The collection denoting a confused crowd is here excepted and by _paryudasa_ negation the other is taken. Thus भिक्षुकनिकायः 'the assembly of beggars'; ब्राह्मणनिकायः 'the assembly of _Brahmanas_'; वैयाकरणनिकायाः 'the assembly of Grammarians'.\n\nBut सूकरनिचयः 'a herd of hogs'; because it is a mere collection. So also कृताकृतसमुच्चयः 'the collection of what is done and not done'; प्रमाणसमुच्चयः 'the collection of proofs'. Here there is no सङ्घ in either of the two senses, it not being a collection of living animals, the affix _ghan_ is not employed.",
    "33043": "The word कर्म means 'action' and is not the technical '_Karma_' meaning the accusative case. व्यतिहार means reciprocity or interchange of action. The word so evolved is feminine in form and denotes mere 'action' (भाव) also. The _anubandha_ च in णच् is qualitative and is added to distinguish this affix from other affixes: thus in _sutra_ (V. 4. 14) this particular affix is meant.\n\nThus वि + अव + क्रुश् + णच् + अञ् + ङीष् = व्यावक्रोशी (V. 4. 14,) and (VII. 3. 6) 'mutual abuse'. So also व्यावहासी, व्यावलेखी. The affix णच् forms only an imaginary stem; for this stem must take the affix अञ् by (V. 4. 14), which even does not form the complete word until the affix ङीष् of the feminine is added.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the feminine'? Observe व्यतिपाको वर्तते ।\n\nThe making of this a separate _sutra_ by itself and not reading it in the subdivision of feminine affixes beginning with क्तिन् (III. 3. 94) is for the sake of removing the obstructing aphorisms that would otherwise have prevented the application of this rule.\n\nFor, had it been taught in connection with क्तिन् &c, then the affixes that would have debarred क्तिन् &c, would a fortiori have debarred this also. But by keeping it separate from that class, it is indicated that those obstructive affixes which debar क्तिन् &c, do not debar this. Thus व्यावचोरी, व्यावचर्ची । Here चुर् being a ण्यन्त class root would have taken युच् (III. 3. 107) in the feminine, as चोरणा; and चर्च् would have taken अङ् by (III. 3. 104), as चर्चा. The roots ईक्ष् and ईह्, by (III. 3. 102) & (III. 3. 103), take अ by debarring क्तिन् । This debarring affix अ, however, is not debarred by this rule; as व्यतीक्षा, व्यतीहा are the proper feminine forms, and not व्यतीक्षी &c. The form व्यातुक्षी is, however, an apparent exception. All these exceptions, counter-exceptions &c. are examples of बहुलं taught in (III. 3. 113).",
    "33044": "The word अभिविधि means co-extensiveness, that is to say, the complete comprehension or relation between the action and the quality. Thus सांराविणम् 'a general or tumultuous uproar'; सं + कूट् + इन् + अण (V. 4. 15.) and (VI 4. 164) = 'a general confusion'; so सांस्राविणम् 'a general flow or stream'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning co-extensiveness'? Observe सङ्कोटः, संरावः, सन्द्रावः ।\n\nWhy do we use the word भाव again in this _sutra_, when its _anuvritti_ was already flowing from _sutra_ (III. 3. 18)? The object is that the वाऽसरूप rule (III. 1. 94) should not apply here and hence घञ् never comes in this sense. _Patanjali_ says that the repetition is for the sake of indicating that in neuter gender, when co-extensiveness is expressed, the affixes क्त &c. are prohibited; so that the affixes क्त &c. should not come in the neuter with the force of भाव ।\n\nThe separateness of this _sutra_ is for the same purpose as the last aphorism. The affix ल्युट् is not, however, prohibited; as सङ्कुटनम्. See rule कृत्यल्युटो बहुलं (III. 3. 113). The affix इनुण् (the operative part being इन्) forms but an imaginary stem, which does not become real and complete till it takes the affix अण् by (V. 4. 15), as shown above.",
    "33045": "Though इनुण् is immediately, near, we take the _anuvritti_ of घञ् (III. 3. 16), because we see that its _anuvritti_ is possible.\n\nThe word आक्रोश means 'cursing'. As अवग्राहो हन्त ते वृषलभूयात् 'cursed be thou, O! sinner'. So also निग्राहस्ते भूयात् ।\n\nWhy ‘when meaning cursing'? Observe अवग्रहः पदस्य; निग्रहश्चोरस्य ।",
    "33046": "As पात्रप्रग्राहेण चरति भिक्षुः पिण्डार्थी 'the beggar walks for the sake of alms, carrying a vessel in hand'; स्रुवप्रग्राहेण चरति द्विजो दक्षिणार्थी 'carrying a sacrificial ladle, the _Brahmana_ walks about for his fee'. The word लिप्सा means 'the wish to have something'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning desire of gain'? Observe प्रग्रहो देवदत्तस्य ।",
    "33047": "As उत्तरपरिग्राहः 'the northern fencing of the sacrificial altar'; अधरपरिग्राहः 'the southern fencing of the sacrificial altar'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when relating to sacrifices'? Observe परिग्रहः देवदत्तस्य 'the fencing of _Devadatta_'.",
    "33048": "The वृ here means both वृङ् and वृञ्. This debars the affix अप्. As नीवाराः 'rice growing wild or without cultivation'.\n\nWhy do we say 'meaning grain'? Observe निवरा कन्या 'a virgin girl'.",
    "33049": "This debars the affix _ach_ (III. 3. 56). Thus उच्छ्रायः 'rising of a planet'; उद्यावः 'mixing'; उत्पावः 'purifying ghee'; and उद्रावः 'flight'.\n\nHow do you explain the form समुच्छ्रयः in पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः ? The word विभाषा 'optionally' in the next _sutra_, exerts a retrospective effect on this _sutra_, and the form is an optional one. This is a most unusual thing and is called सिंहावलोकनन्यायः 'the maxim of the lion's backward glance'. It is used when one casts a retrospective glance at what he has left behind, while at the same time he is proceeding, just as the lion, while going onward in search of prey, now and then bonds his neck backwards to see if any thing be within its reach.",
    "33050": "As आरावः or आरवः 'noise'; आप्लावः or आप्लवः 'bathing'.",
    "33051": "The word 'optionally' is understood here. The word वर्षप्रतिबन्ध means the absence of rain, from some cause or another, when the season has arrived; as अवग्राहः or अवग्रहो देवस्य 'the draught of rain'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning obstruction of rain'? Observe अवग्रहः पदस्य ।",
    "33052": "Both the words _grah_ and _vibhasha_ are understood here. By 'relation to commerce' is meant here the string of the balance; and not commerce in general. That string by which a balance is held is called तुलाप्रग्रहः or तुलाप्रग्राहः, as तुलाप्रग्राहेण चरति or तुलाप्रग्रहेण चरति; and this may be said of any person whether he be a trader or not.\n\nWhy do we say 'when belonging to commerce'? Observe प्रग्रहो देवदत्तस्य 'the whip of _Devadatta_'.",
    "33053": "The word रश्मि means here the bridle by means of which horses &c. joined to the carriage, are held under control; as प्रग्रहः or प्रग्राहः 'a rein'.",
    "33054": "As प्रावारः or प्रवरः 'a cloak, a veil'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when it means a covering'? Observe प्रवरागौ ।",
    "33055": "The word अवज्ञान means 'contempt', 'neglect', 'disregard' &c. As परिभावः or परिभवः 'insult, humiliation'.\n \nWhy do we say 'when meaning disregard'? The word परिभवः may be then constructed to mean सर्वतोभवनं = परिभवः 'surrounding'.",
    "33056": "The words within brackets are to be supplied from _sutras_ 18 and 19: and these words are to be supplied in every subsequent _sutra_ as far as _sutra_ 113 of this chapter. This debars घञ्. The च in अच् is qualitative, in _sutras_ like (VI. 2. 144).\n\nThus, चयः 'collecting'; अयः 'going'; जयः 'victory'; क्षयः 'wasting'.\n\nVart:- In this connection the words भय &c. should also be enumerated. As भी + अच् = भयम् 'fear'; वर्षम् 'rain'. These being neuter words, otherwise would have taken the affix क्त &c. but for this _Vartika_.\n\nVart:- The words जव and सव are formed by this affix, and occur in the Vedas. As ऊर्वोरस्तु मे जयः, पञ्चोदनसवः । These roots जु and सु would have otherwise taken the affix अप्. The form would have been the same, but there would be difference of accent. See _Rig_. I. 112. 21, and _Yaj_. XI. 2.",
    "33057": "This debars घञ्. The प् is indicatory for the sake of accent (III. 1. 3); as, कृ + अप् = करः 'scattering'; गॄ--गरः 'beverage, poison'; शॄ--शरः 'arrow'; यु--यवः 'barley'; लू--लवः 'reaping'; पू--पवः 'winnowing corn'.\n\nThe द् in ॠद् is merely for the sake of euphony: it is not त् changed into द; for then by the rule 'that which follows त् is also called तपर' short उ only would have been taken and not long ऊ (I. 1.70).",
    "33058": "This debars घञ्; and in the case of निश्चि the affix अच् is debarred. As ग्रहः 'a planet'; वरः 'a boon'; दरः 'tearing, a cave'; निश्चयः 'certainty'; गमः 'march'.\n\nThe verb निश्चि would have taken अच्, but takes अप् which causes difference of accent.\n\nVart:-The roots वश् and रण् should also be included in this; as वशः 'obedient'; रणः 'battle'.\n\nVart:- When the sense is that of घञ्, the affix क is directed to be employed, after the following verbs :- स्था, स्ना, पा, व्यध्, हन् and युध् । As प्रस्थः 'a table-land' (on which they move); प्रस्नः 'a vessel for bathing' (in which they bathe); प्रपाः 'a place where water is distributed to travellers' (that out of which they drink); आविधः (VI. 1. 16) 'an awl, a drill' (that by which they pierce); विघ्नः 'an obstacle' (in which they are obstructed); आयुधः 'battle' (where they fight).",
    "33059": "As विघसः (11. 4. 38) 'half-chewed morsel'; प्रघसः 'voracious'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when compounded with an _upasarga_'? Observe घासः 'grass'; अद् + घञ् = घस् + अ (II. 4. 38).",
    "33060": "As नि + अद् + ण = नि + आद् + अ = न्यादः  (VII. 2. 116) 'feeding'; नि + अद् + अप् =  नि + घस् + अ (II. 4. 38) = निघसः 'eating, food'.",
    "33061": "This debars घञ्. As व्यधः 'wound'; जपः 'muttering'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when _upasarga_-less'? Observe आव्याघा, उपजाया ।",
    "33062": "Thus स्वनः or स्वानः 'sound'; हसः or हासः 'laughter'. But with _upasargas_, we have only one form; प्रस्वानः 'a loud noise'; प्रहासः 'a loud laughter'.",
    "33063": "This debars घञ्. As संयामः or संयमः 'restraint'; उपयामः or उपयमः 'marriage'; नियामः or नियमः 'restrictive rule'; वियामः or वियमः 'check, distress'; यामः or यमः ।",
    "33064": "This debars घञ्. Thus निगदः or निगादः 'recitation';  निनदः or निनादः 'noise'; निपठः or निपाठः 'reading'; निस्वनः or निस्वानः 'a noise'.",
    "33065": "This debars the affix घञ्. Thus निक्वणः or निक्वाणः 'a musical tone'. क्वणः or क्वाणः 'sound'. When it refers to 'flute', it must have some _upasarga_ not necessarily नि; as कल्याणप्रक्वणा वीणा.\n\nBut not so here, अतिक्वाणो वर्तते, where the _upasarga_ being अति and the word not referring to 'a flute', no option is allowed. When flute is not meant the _upasarga_ must be नि or no _upasarga_ at all, for the optional application of the affix अप्. To sum up, क्वण् takes अप् optionally under three conditions:- Ist when preceded by नि, or 2ndly when having no _upasarga_, or 3rdly when it refers to 'flute', and then it must have some _upasarga_.",
    "33066": "The word नित्यं 'invariably' is used in the aphorism in order to stop the _anuvritti_ of the word optionally. Thus मूलकपणः 'a handful of radishes'; शाकपणः 'a handful of vegetable'. These words secondarily have come to mean 'a measure equal to a handful', irrespective of any thing.\n\nWhen not meaning measure, we have पणः 'trade'.",
    "33067": "This debars घञ्. As विद्यामदः 'pride of knowledge'; धनमदः 'pride of wealth'; कुलमदः 'pride of family'. When compounded with _upasargas_, we have उन्मादः 'mad'; प्रमादः 'error or carelessness'.",
    "33068": "As कन्यानां प्रमदः 'the joy of girls'; कोकिलानां सम्मदः 'the rejoicing of cuckoos'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning delight'? Observe प्रमादः 'carelessness'; सम्मादः 'frenzy'.\n\nInstead of saying 'the verb _mad_ preceded by _pra_ and _sam_ takes the affix _ap_' which also would have given the above forms, the full forms have been used in the _sutra_ to indicate that these words are रूढि in this sense; for the sense of the root is not visible in these words.",
    "33069": "This debars घञ्. The root अज 'means to go, to throw'. When preceded by सम्, it means 'a collection'; and preceded by उत् it means 'driving'. As समजः पशूनां 'a herd of cattle'; उदजः पशूनां 'driving forth of cattle'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when applying to cattle'? Observe समाजो ब्राह्मणानां, उदाजः क्षत्रियाणां ।",
    "33070": "This word is derived from the root ग्रह्. The verb ग्रह् takes the affix अप् and thus forms ग्रह्, and then irregularly र is changed into ल; as अक्षस्य ग्लहः 'cast of the dice'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when referring to gambling'? Observe ग्रहः पादस्य ।\n \nOthers say, this word is derived regularly from the root ग्लह् 'to gamble', by adding the affix अप्, and thus debarring घञ्. They suppose, therefore, the existence of the root ग्लह्, to explain the form ग्लहः । The counter-example which they would give, is ग्लाहः 'receiving', formed by adding the affix घञ् ।",
    "33071": "This debars घञ्. The word प्रजनं means 'the first covering of a cow by a bull'. As गवामुपसरः 'impregnation of cows'; पशूनामुपसरः 'impregnation of cattle'.",
    "33072": "This debars घञ्. As नि + ह्वे + अप् = नि + हु + अ (VI. 1. 108) = नि + हो + अ (VII. 3. 84) = निहव (VI. 1. 78) 'invocation'; अभिहवः 'invocation'; उपहवः 'invitation'; विहवः 'calling'. But प्रह्वायः 'a summons'.",
    "33073": "As आहवः 'battle' (where they challenge each other). But otherwise आह्वायः 'calling'.",
    "33074": "The word आहावः is irregularly formed from ह्वे by the prefix आ, then _samprasarana_, and the _vriddhi_ of the vowel. Thus आ + ह्वे + अप् = आहु + अ = आहौ + अ = आहावः 'a trough near a well for watering cattle'. Otherwise आह्वायः 'calling'. Even in the word आहावः the sense of calling is understood. It is that place near a well, containing water, where cattle are called or invited to drink water.",
    "33075": "As हवः 'calling'; हवे हवे सुहवं शूरमिन्द्रम् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when no _upasarga_ is in composition with it'? Observe आह्वायः । Though the _anuvritti_ of the word भाव was understood in this aphorism from _sutra_ 18, its repetition here shows that the _anuvritti_ of _sutra_ 19. which was running, must not be taken; so that this word applies to agent-_karaka_ also.",
    "33076": "Thus वध has _udatta_ accent on its final. The affix अप् which is _andatta_ generally (III. I. 4) thus becomes _udatta_.\n\nAs वधश्चोराणाम् 'the killing of thieves'; वधोदस्यूनाम् 'the killing of robbers'.\n\nWhen action is not denoted, the affix घञ् applies; as घातः 'a blow'.\n\nSo also when an _upasarga_ is in composition with it; as प्रघातः, घातः ।\n\nThe word च in the aphorism does not connect हन् with the substitute वध, there being no co-ordination, it refers to the affixes under discussion. Thus we have the affix घञ् also; as घातः 'killing'.",
    "33077": "The word मूर्त्ति means 'hardness', 'solidity'. Thus अभ्रघनः 'a mass of cloud'; दधिघनः 'solid curd'. How do we say घनं दधि ? Here the quality is taken for the thing qualified.",
    "33078": "As अन्तर् + हन् + अप् = अन्तर् = घन् + अ = अन्तर्घनः 'name of a country of _Bahika_'; (a porch or court, an open space before the house between the entrance door and the house). Some write the word with a ण as अन्तर्घणः, that is also valid.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a country'? Observe अन्तर्घातो 'striking in the middle'.",
    "33079": "Thus प्रघणः or प्रघाणः 'a porch before the door of a house, a portico'. This is formed from हन् with प्र, irregularly.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a portion of a house'? Observe प्रघातः ।",
    "33080": "This is formed from उत् + हन् irregularly. Thus उद्घनः 'a carpenter's bench' (the wood on which placing other planks &c. the carpenter carves &c).\n\nWhen not having this sense, we have उद्घातः 'uneven'.",
    "33081": "This is formed irregularly from अप + हन्. Thus अपघनः 'a limb or member of the body'. The word अङ्गम् means a portion of the body, such as hand or foot, and not the whole body. Otherwise we have अपघातः ।",
    "33082": "As अयोघनः 'a forge-hammer' (whereby the iron is destroyed); विघनः 'a mallet'; द्रुघनः 'an axe'. Some write द्रुघणः, the न being changed into ण either by rule (VIII. 4. 3.) or by including this word in the class of आरोहणादि (IV. 2. 80).",
    "33083": "The word च in the _sutra_ draws in अप् from the last aphorism and in that case घन् replaces हन्. Thus स्तम्बघ्नः or स्तम्बघनः 'a small hoe for weeding clumps of grass'. In the feminine gender, the forms are स्तम्बघ्ना as well as स्तम्बघना । when क is added, we have स्तम्बघ्नः । Thus हन् + क + ह्न् + अ (VI. 4. 98) = घ्न (VII. 3. 54). When अप् is added हन् is totally replaced by घन् । When instrument is not meant, we have स्तम्बघातः ।",
    "33084": "Thus परिघः or पलिघः (VIII. 2. 22) 'an iron beam used for locking or shutting the gate, an iron club'.",
    "33085": "It is formed by adding अप् (III. 3. 76) to the verb हन् preceded by the _upasarga_ उप, then eliding the penultimate अ of ह; this is the irregularity. Then by _sandhi_ rules हन् is changed into घ्नः । This form would have been given by the affix क also, without any irregularity.\n\nThe word आश्रय refers to 'proximity, contiguity'. Thus पर्वतोघ्नः 'the declivity of the mountain'; so also ग्रामोपघ्नः 'bordering the village'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning support'? Observe पर्वतोपघातः ।",
    "33086": "These words are thus formed; सम् + हन् + अप् = सं + ह् + अ = सं + घ् + अ = सङ्घः। Thus सङ्घः पशूनाम् 'a herd of cattle'; so also उद्घो मनुष्यः 'an excellent man'. The word 'respectively' is inserted from (I. 3. 10). When not used in these senses, we have सङ्घातः 'union'.",
    "33087": "The word निमित means 'measured all round' i.e. 'as high as broad'. As निघा वृक्षाः 'trees as high as broad'. निघा शालयः 'square or cubic or circular halls'. Otherwise, when not meaning 'as high as broad', we have निघातः 'a blow'. The word निमित = समन्तान्मितं, समारोहपरिणाहम् । It may be derived from मा or from मि । In the first case it will mean 'measured' and in the other, 'erected, built'. Professor Bothlingk refers to _Apastamba_ _Dharma_. I. 20. 30 for the meaning of this word.",
    "33088": "The phrases 'when the sense is that of mere action', and 'when the sense is that of an appellative, the word being related to the verb from which its name is deduced, but not as agent', are of course understood in this, as in all the previous aphorisms. Then by (IV. 4. 20), (of the affix क्ति, मप् is always the augment) we must add म, for we can not use the affix त्रि alone; but we must always use त्रिम. Thus डुपचष् to cook--पक्तिमम् 'what is ripe'; डुवप्--उपत्रिमम् 'sown' (VI. I. 15); डुकृञ्--कृत्रिमम् 'artificial'.",
    "33089": "As टुवेपृ--वेपथुः 'a trembling'; टुओश्वि--श्वयथुः 'swelling'; टुक्षुः--क्षवथुः 'sneezing'; टुदु--दवथुः 'burning'.",
    "33090": "The conditions of _sutras_ 18 and 19 are understood here also. The ङ् of नङ् is for the sake of prohibiting _guna_ or _vriddhi_ (I. I. 5); as यज्ञः 'sacrifice'; याच्ञा 'solicitation'; यत्नः 'effort'; विश्नः (VI. 4. 19) 'lustre'; प्रश्नः 'a question'; रक्ष्णः 'protection.\n\n The root प्रच्छ, by (VI. 1. 16), ought to have changed its र into ॠ before the ङित् affix नङ्. Its not doing so must be taken to be an irregularity countenanced by _Panini_, as we know from the fact that _Panini_ himself uses the form प्रश्नः in (III. 2. II7).",
    "33091": "The final न् is indicatory and regulates the accent (VI. I. 197); as स्वप्नः 'a dream'.",
    "33092": "The क् is indicatory, by force of which the final आ is elided (VI. 4. 64). Thus प्र + दा + कि = प्रदिः 'a present'; प्रधिः 'the periphery of a wheel'; उपाधिः 'fraud'; अन्तर्द्धिः 'vanishing'.",
    "33093": "As जलधिः 'the ocean (in which water is held)';  शरधिः 'a quiver (that in which arrows are put)'.\n\nThe word 'location' in the aphorism indicates that the words so formed should have no other significance. The word च in the aphorism draws in the affix कि from the last _sutra_.",
    "33094": "The conditions of rules (III. 3. 18.) and (III. 3. 19) are understood here also. This supersedes घञ्, अच् and अप् affixes. Thus कृतिः 'action'; चितिः 'a gathering'; मतिः 'understanding'.\n\nVart:- The affix _ktin_ should be declared to come after the verbs आप् 'to get' &c. There is no list of these words given anywhere, but by seeing the form, we can infer the affix. Thus आप्तिः 'getting'; राद्धिः 'accomplishment'; दीप्तिः 'shining'; स्रस्तिः 'a slip'; ध्वस्तिः 'destruction'; लब्धिः 'gain'.\n\nVart:- So also after the verbs श्रु 'to hear', यज् 'to worship' and स्तु 'to praise', when instrument is meant; as श्रुतिः 'ear' (that by which we hear); so इष्टिः 'a sacrifice'; स्तुतिः 'a praise.\n\nVart:- The affix नि comes after the verbs ग्लौ 'to be exhausted', म्लै 'to fade', ज्या 'to grow old' and हा 'to leave'; as ग्लानिः 'exhaustion'; म्लानिः 'fading', ज्यानिः 'old age'; हानिः 'loss'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्तिन् coming after verbs ending in long ॠ and the verbs लू &c. is like a _Nishtha_. Thus कीर्णिः 'scattering': This form is thus evolved: कॄ + क्तिन् = कि + ति (VII. 1. 100) = किर् + ति (I. 1. 51) = कीर् + ति (VIII. 2. 77). At this stage, त is changed into न by the affix being treated as a _Nishtha_ (VIII. 2. 42), and this न is changed into ण by the ordinary rules of _sandhi_; so also गीर्णिः 'praise'; जीर्णिः 'old age'; शीर्णिः 'drying'; लूनिः (VIII. 2. 44) 'cutting'; यूनिः 'joining'; धूनिः 'agitation'; पूनिः 'destruction'.\n\nVart:- The affix क्विप् comes after the verbs सम्पत् & c; as सम्पत् 'prosperity'; विपत् 'a calamity'; प्रतिपत् 'access'. The affix क्तिन् is also employed after these verbs:-- as, सम्पत्तिः, विपत्तिः । The verbs लू &c. are 21 verbs of _kryadi_ class.",
    "33095": "This debars the affix अङ् (III. 3. 106) which generally supersedes क्तिन् in cases of compound verbs ending in long आ. Thus प्रस्थितिः 'a journey' (VII. 4. 40); उद्गीति 'a singing aloud'; गै + क्ति = गा + ति (VI. 1. 45) = गी + ति (VI. 4. 66); सगीतिः 'a concert'; प्रपीतिः 'a cistern'; सम्पीतिः 'drinking together'; पक्तिः 'cooking'.\n\nThe repetition of the word भाव in this aphorism, in spite of its _anuvritti_ being understood from _sutra_ 18 is to exclude every other significance.\n\nHow do we get forms like अवस्था and संस्था ? _Panini_ himself, in his _sutras_, has used forms like व्यवस्था &c. See (I. 1. 34). This is enough justification for us to derive forms like अवस्था, संस्था &c. by applying the affix अङ् under rule 106 inspite of the present _sutra_, which requires us to apply क्तिन् only.",
    "33096": "The construction of this _sutra_ is anomalous. Instead of the bases being put in the ablative case, they are put in the nominative case. Thus वृष्टिः 'raining'; इष्टिः 'wishing'; पक्तिः 'cooking'; मतिः 'thinking'; वित्तिः 'knowing'; भूतिः 'being'; वीतिः 'consuming'; रातिः 'giving'.\n \nThe affix क्तिन् has been generally ordained by _sutra_ 94 after all verbs. The present _sutra_ is made for the sake of regulating the accent in the case of these nouns. From इष् we have also an irregular noun इच्छा (III 3. 101), and another by the general rule 94 having acute accent on the first syllable, altogether 3 forms. See _Rig_ _Veda_ I. II6. 12; II 5. 6; 1.62. 3, 57. 2; IV. 24. 7; III. 39. I; I. 6. 5, 60. I; X. 95. 17 for these words.",
    "33097": "The _anuvritti_ of the word मन्त्रे does not exist in this; but the word उदात्त of the last syllable is understood here. The word ऊति is thus formed :- अव् 'to protect' + क्तिन् = ऊ + तिः (VI. 4. 20) = ऊतिः । this form is regular and could be evolved from _sutra_ 94 also; but not so the accent. The irregularity in पूतिः and जूतिः consists in the lengthening of उ into ऊ; in सातिः the आ of the root सै which becomes सा by (VI. I 45), is not changed into इ, as rule (VII. 4. 40) required, and this is the irregularity. This form may also be derived from the root सन् with perfect propriety, except as to the accent which would be regulated by the present _sutra_: thus सन् + क्तिन् = सा + क्तिन् (VI. 4. 42) साति. The form हेति may by derived either from हन् or हिनोति ।\n\nइन्द्र वाजेषु नोऽव सहस्रप्रधनेषु च । उग्रउग्राभिरूतिभिः । (_Rig_. I. 7. 4) 'O _Indra_, mayst thou mighty, defend us in battles and in fights of a thousand duels, with thy mighty protections'.",
    "33098": "This supersedes क्तिन्. Thus व्रज्या 'wandering about'; इज्या (VI. 1. 15) 'worshipping'. The प् of क्यप् is indicatory, and though it serves no purpose in this _sutra_, it is, however, necessary in the next, for it is by force of क्यप् having प् that we add a त by (VI 1. 71), in the words formed in the next aphorism.",
    "33099": "Thus समज्या 'an assembly'; निषद्या 'a small bed or couch'; निपत्या 'slippery ground'; मन्या 'thinking'; विद्या 'knowledge'; सुत्या (VI. 1. 71) 'extraction of _soma_ juice, parturition'; शय्या 'bed'; भृत्या 'wages, service'; इत्या 'a litter, palanquin'.\n\nHere a question arises as regards भृ. By rule (III. 1. 112), भृ would have taken क्यप्, and we could have got the form भृत्या by that rule also. But the भृत्या formed under that rule would not have denoted an appellative which the present rule does. It would be said that rule (III. 1. 112) when it used the words असञ्ज्ञायां, was rather too wide, for क्यप् does come in denoting सञ्ज्ञा in feminine nouns by the present rule; so that the word असञ्ज्ञायां there, must be qualified by the phrase, 'except in the feminine'. The test whether rule 112, is too widely worded or not, has been made to hinge on the forming of the term भार्या meaning 'wife'. This word is formed by the affix ण्यत् to the exclusion of क्यप् ।\n\nसञ्ज्ञायां पुंसि दृष्टत्वा न ते भार्या प्रसिध्यति ।\nस्त्रियां भावाधिकारोऽस्ति नेन भार्या प्रसिध्यति ॥\n\nThe word भावाधिकारः is explained by the author of _Kasika_ as भावव्यापारो, वाच्यत्वेन विवक्षितः, नतु शास्त्रीयोऽधिकारः।",
    "33100": "By the force of the word च we draw the affix क्यप् into this _sutra_, and by the process called योगविभाग we can split up this aphorism into two :-\n\n(1) कृञः 'after the root कृ there is the affix क्तिन्'\n\n(2) श च 'and the affix श as well as क्यप्'. Thus क्रिया, कृत्वा (VI. 1. 71) and कृतिः । When the affix श is added, the root assumes the form क्रिय by (III. 1. 67).",
    "33101": "The word is thus formed : इष् + श = इच्छ् + अ = इच्छा. The यक् ordained by (III. 1. 67) is not added, this is the irregularity.\n\nVart:- The following words are also irregularly formed :- परिसर्या 'perambulation'; परिचर्या 'attendance, service'; मृगया 'hunting'; अटाट्य 'the habit of roaming about as a religious mendicant'.\n\nVart:- From the root जागृ we have either जागरा or जागर्या 'waking'. The first is formed by the affix अ, the latter by श which brings in यक् (III. I. 67).",
    "33102": "The verbs that end in an affix are derivative roots, such as Desideratives, Causatives, Intensives and Denominatives. Though taking affixes, they are called धातु (III. 1. 32), after these verbs the affix अ is used in forming the feminine noun.\n\nThus कृ + सन् = चिकीर्ष् 'to wish to do'; this is a Derivative root; after this root चिकीर्ष्, we add अ । Thus चिकीर्ष् + अ (VI. 4. 48) = चिकीर्ष । Then we add टाप् by (IV. 1. 4.) and get चिकीर्षा 'the desire to do'; so also जिहीर्षा 'the desire to take'; पुत्रीया 'the desire to be like a son'; पुत्रकाम्या 'desire of a son’; लोलूया 'much cutting'; कण्डूया 'itch'. The _sutra_ is also found as अः प्रत्ययात् ।",
    "33103": "This debars क्तिन् । Thus कुण्डा 'an adulteress'; हुण्डा 'a tigress'; ईहा 'effort'; उहा 'supplying an ellipsis'.\n\nWhy do we say 'which has a prosodially heavy vowel'? Observe भक्ति devotion'. Why do we say 'which ends in a consonant'? Observe नीति 'polity'.",
    "33104": "Thus जॄष् has an indicatory ष्, the real root being जॄः । From it we have जरा 'old age' (VII. 4. 16); त्रपुष्--त्रपा 'bashfulness'.\n\nSo also from verbs of _Bhidadi_ class we have भिदा 'breaking'; in the alternative we have भित्तिः । So also छिदा 'cutting'; छित्तिः 'cutting'; आरा 'a knife, an iron instrument'; आर्तिः 'distress'; धारा 'a stream'; धृतिः । The list of _Bhidadi_ verbs will not be found given in one place in the _Dhatupatha_. They have been collected from different _Ganas_, and are the following:-\n\nभिदा, छिदा, विदा, क्षिपा, गुहा (गिर्योषध्योः), श्रद्धा, मेधा, गोधा, आरा, हारा, कारा, क्षिया, भारा, धारा, लेखा, रेखा, चूडा, पीडा, वपा, वसा, मृजा, सृजा, कृपा, (क्रपेः सम्प्रसारणं च)॥",
    "33105": "The force of च is to include the affix युच् into this _sutra_ (see III. 3. 107). All these verbs belong to the _Churadi_ or 10th class, and would have exclusively taken युच् by (III. 3. 107). \n\nThus चिन्ता 'thought'; पूजा 'worship'; कथा 'narration'; कुम्बा 'a covering', 'a thick petticoat'; चर्च्चा 'recitation'.\n\nWhen the affix is युच्, the forms are चिन्तना &c. (VII. I. I).",
    "33106": "This supersedes क्तिन्. Thus प्रदा, प्रधा, उपदा, उपधा, &c.\n\nVart:- For the purposes of this rule the particles श्रत् and अन्तर् should be treated like _upasargas_. Thus श्रद्धा 'faith' अन्तर्द्धा (I. 4. 59).",
    "33107": "This excludes the affix अ (III. I. 102). Thus कृ + णिच् = कारि; कारि + युच् = कारणा (the इ is elided by (VI. 4. 51)) 'the causing to do'; हारणा 'the causing to take'; आसना 'the sitting'; श्रन्थना 'the loosening'. How do we get the form आस्या ? It is the feminine of आस्य formed by adding ण्यत् to the root आस् by (III. 1. 124). Is not that rule made non-applicable by rule (III. 1. 94), which declares that वाऽसरूप rule does not apply to Feminine affixes? Yes, that is, however, not total exclusion. The phrase अस्त्रियाम् in (III 1. 94) is to be interpreted thus:-  \"Non-uniform affixes prohibit each other, when they belong to the class of affixes especially ordained for the feminine nouns; such as the affix क्तिन् (III. 3. 9), क्यप् (III. 3. 98), अ (III. 3. 102): That is to say, an _utsarga_-feminine affix will be always superseded by an _apavada_-feminine affix; but a feminine affix in general will not supersede another affix which is not enjoined in the feminine gender especially. In other words, feminine affixes inter se supersede each other totally, but not so with regard to general कृत् affixes\". Now by the present _sutra_ the root आस् takes युच्; this totally excludes other feminine affixes like अ (III. 1. 102); but it does not exclude the non-feminine affix ण्यत् ।\n\nThe root श्रन्थि taken here belongs to the _Kryadi_ class, meaning 'to loosen' and is not the श्रन्थ of _Churadi_ class, for the latter would be included, as a matter of course, by belonging to the _Churadi_ class which class of verbs take the affix णिच् ।\n\nVart:- The verbs घट्ट 'to move', वन्द 'to praise', and विद 'to feel', should also be enumerated, as taking युच्. Thus घट्टना 'shaking', वन्दना 'praising', वेदना 'knowledge, feeling, pain'. The verb घट्ट here belongs to the _Tudadi_ class, and means 'to move' and not घट्ट of the _Churadi_ class, for that is already included by being णिजन्त ।\n\nVart:- The affix युच् comes after इष् when it does not mean 'to desire'. Thus अध्येषणा 'solicitation'; अन्वेषणा 'the searching after'.\n\nVart:– So also optionally when इष् takes the _upasarga_ परि; as, पर्येषणा or परीष्टिः 'investigation by reasoning'.",
    "33108": "This debars क्तिन् and all the rest. By using the word आख्या in the _sutra_ it is meant that the word so formed by this affix should be the appellation of the disease. The word 'diversely' shows the usual licence in the application of all the rules of grammar. Thus प्रच्छर्द्दिका (VII. I. 1) 'vomiting'; प्रवाहिका 'diarrhea'; विवर्चिका 'itch, scab'. Sometimes this affix does not apply; as शिरोर्त्तिः 'head-ache'.\n\nVart:- The affix _nvul_ is employed also in simply pointing out the meaning of the roots; thus, आशिका 'to enjoy', शायिका 'lie down' &c.\n\nVart:- The affixes इक् and श्तिप् (that is शप् and तिप्) are also employed in merely pointing out the roots; as भिदिः, छिदिः, पचतिः &c. The constant use of these affixes is to be found in these very _sutras_. In the aphorisms the roots are exhibited in various ways; thus in _sutra_ 49 of this chapter we have the root श्रि and यु exhibited as श्रयतिः and यौतिः । These latter forms indicating nothing more than the simple roots. So also, see (VIII. 4. 17); (VI. 4. 49).\n\nVart:- The affix कार is employed in merely pointing out letters; as ककारः means 'the letter क'; so also अकारः 'the letter अ'; इकारः 'the letter इ'.  \n\nVart:- The affix इफ is employed in pointing out the letter र; as रेफ ।\n\nVart:- The affix छ् comes after the word नत्वर्थ in merely pointing it out, and there is elision of the final अ; as मत्वर्थीयः ।\n\nVart:- The affix इञ् comes after the verbs  अज् & c; as आजिः, आतिः, आदिः ।\n\nVart:- The affix इक् comes after the verbs  कृष् & c; as, कृषिः, किरिः, &c.",
    "33109": "As उद्दालकपुष्पभञ्जिका 'a sort of game played by the people in the eastern districts in which _uddalaka_ flowers are broken or crushed'. वरणपुष्पप्रवाहिका 'a sort of game'; आभ्यूषखादिका; आचोषखादिका; शालभञ्जिका; तालभञ्जिका ।",
    "33110": "The word परिप्रश्न means 'question' and आख्यान means 'answer'; in the _sutra_, in making the compound of these words, the logical sequence is not observed. The compound आख्यानपरिप्रश्न may, however, be justified on the ground that in a Compound a word consisting of smaller number of syllables should stand first (II. 2. 34,) and hence _akhyana_ is put first.\n\nThe force of च is to draw the _anuvritti_ of the word ण्वुल् from the last into this. By the word 'optionally', it is meant that those affixes which would otherwise present themselves from the subsequent rules, should also be applied; thus: Q.—कां त्वं कारिमकार्षीः 'What work did you do'? A.—सर्वां कारिमकार्षम् 'I did all work'. Optionally we may have instead of कारि the following also. Q.—कां कारिकां, कृत्यां, कृतिं, क्रियां, अकार्षीः A.— सर्वां कारिकां or कृत्यां or कृतिं or क्रियां अकार्षम् । Similarly, Q.—कां गणिं (गणनां, गणिकां &c.) अजीगणः A.— सर्वाङ्गणिं &c. अजीगणम्. So also कां याजिम् or याजिकाम्; कां याचिम् or याचिकां &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'in question and answer'? Observe कृतिः and हृतिः ।",
    "33111": "The word पर्याय means turn or order of succession; अर्ह means worthy of respect; ॠणं means debt owed to another; and उत्पत्ति means birth or production. This rule supersedes क्तिन् and other affixes. Thus: (1) भवतः शयिका 'your turn of sleeping'; भवतोऽग्रग्रासिका 'your turn of eating first'. (2) अर्हति भवानिक्षुभक्षिकाम् 'you deserve to have a meal of sugar and molasses'. (3) इक्षुभक्षिकां मे धारयसि 'thou owest me a meal of sugar and molasses'; ओदनभोजिकां 'a meal of rice'; पयः पायिकां 'a drink of milk'. (4) इक्षुभक्षिका मे उदपादि ।\n\nThe word 'optionally' is understood in this _sutra_ also; as चिकीर्षोत्पद्यते ।\n\nThe forms given by ण्वुल् and ण्वुच् are the same, the difference is only in the accent. (VI. 1. 193,) and (VI. 1. 163).",
    "33112": "The _anuvritti_ of the word 'optionally' does not extend to this aphorism. The word आक्रोश means to curse. This supersedes the affixes क्तिन् &c. Thus अकरणिस्ते वृषल भूयात् 'may failure be to thee, O sinner'! तस्याकरणिरेवास्तु 'may he be disappointed'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning to curse'? Observe अकृतिस्तस्य कटस्य 'the non-making of his mat'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when नञ् is in composition'? Observe सृतिस्ते वृषल भूयात् 'may death be to thee, O! sinner'!",
    "33113": "The _anuvritti_ of the phrases 'when denoting action' and 'when the relation of the word formed to its parent verb is not that of an agent', which began with _sutras_ (III. 3. 18) and (III. 3. 19), does not extend to this _sutra_ or further. By saying 'diversely' we mean that they occur in other places than those where ordained by the rules. Thus the _kritya_ affixes are ordained to come when 'act' or 'object' is to be expressed, but they come also when the _karaka_ is other than the objective. Thus स्नानीयं चूर्णम् 'powder for bathing'; दानीयो ब्राह्मणः 'a _Brahmana_ to whom a donation is to be made'. In the first of these examples the 'powder' is the 'instrument' expressible by the 3rd. case, and in the second the '_Brahmana_' is the recipient expressible by the fourth case; so that in both cases the affix is applied without any express rule.\n\nSimilarly, ल्युट् is ordained to come in denoting instrument, location, and a verbal noun (III. 3. 115) and (III. 3. 117). But it is applied in other senses also. Thus राजभोजनाः शालयः 'halls for the eating of kings'; राजाच्छादनानि वासांसि 'dresses to be worn by the king'.\n\nBy using the word 'diversely', even the _krit_ affixes are applied in places other than those expressly ordained. Thus, पादाभ्याम् ह्रियते = पादहारकः । गले चोप्यते = गलेचोपकः । For accent see (VI. 2. 150).",
    "33114": "These are neuter abstract nouns: thus, हसितम् 'laugh'; जल्पितं 'speech'; शायितं 'sleeping'. So also गतं, सहितं &c.",
    "33115": "Thus हसनं छात्रस्य 'the laughter of the student'; शोभनं 'beauty'; जल्पनं 'speech'; शयनं 'sleep'; आसनम् 'seat'.\n\nThe separation of this _sutra_ from the last, in which it might well have been included, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms, in which the _anuvritti_ of _lyut_ only runs, and not that of क्त ।",
    "33116": "This _sutra_ is thus translated by Bohtlingk:-“The affix ल्युट् comes in connection with an object, when through the contact with that, the agent of the action feels a lively pleasure\". Though the affix _lyut_ would have presented itself by the last aphorism, under the circumstances mentioned in this _sutra_, the framing of this _sutra_, is really for the purpose of teaching, that the compound so formed is a नित्य or invariable compound i. e. a compound which cannot be analysed into its component members:--for every उपपद compound is a नित्य compound. (II. 2. 19) Thus पयः पानंसुखं 'the pleasure of drinking milk'; ओदनभोजनं सुखं 'the pleasure of eating rice'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word in construction is in the accusative case'? Observe तूलिकाया उत्थानं सुखं 'rising from a bed of down is pleasant'. Here there is no compounding as the _upapada_ तूलिका is in the ablative case.\n\nWhy do we say 'from the contact'? Observe अग्निकुण्डस्योपासनं सुखं 'it is pleasure to sit near by a fire-hearth'. Here there being no contact between 'fire' and 'body', there is no compounding.\n\nWhy do we say 'to the agent'? Observe गुरोः स्नापनं सुखं 'to the teacher it is pleasure, when he is made to bathe'. Here the word गुरुः is not the agent, but the object of the verb स्नापयति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'corporally'? Observe पुत्रस्य परिष्वञ्जनं सुखम् 'embracing of the son is a pleasure'. Here the pleasure is a mere mental satisfaction and not a physical one.\n\nWhy do we say 'a pleasant sensation'? Observe कण्टकानां मर्दनं दुःखम् 'it is painful to rub thorns'. In all the above counter-examples there is no compounding; see (II. 2. 19) and the connected _sutras_.",
    "33117": "Thus इध्मप्रव्रश्चनः 'an axe' (lit. an instrument for cutting wood); '_palasa_-cutter'; गोदोहनी 'milk-pail' (a vessel into which milk is milked); so also सक्तुधानी । In other words, this affix expresses also the idea of the instrumental case (a tool), and of the locative case (a repository).",
    "33118": "The force of the word प्रायेण 'generally' is to show that this rule is not a universal rule. Thus दन्तच्छदः 'the lip'. छादि 'to cover' + घ (VI. 4. 96) = छद lit. 'that by which the teeth are covered'; so also उरच्छद 'a breast plate'; घटः । These denote instruments.\n\nSo also in denoting 'location'. Thus आ + कृ + घ = आकरः 'a mine', so named because men work (_akurvanti_) in it, आलयः 'a house' that in which men settle down.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the masculine gender'? Observe प्रसाधनम् 'a comb'; (lit. that by which men decorate). Here the affix is _lyut_.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the complete word so formed is merely an appellative'? Observe प्रहरणो दण्डः 'the beating stick'.\n\nThe indicatory घ् is merely qualifying; for the application of _sutra_ (VI. 4. 96.) by which after the causative छादि, when घ is added, the long आ is shortened.",
    "33119": "These words are irregularly formed by the affix घ with the same force as in the last aphorism. This is an _apavada_ or exception to rule (III. 3. 121), by which after roots ending in consonants, the affix घञ् is added. Thus गोचरः 'pasturage', (lit. that in which the cows graze); सञ्चरः 'a passage', (lit. through which they move ); वहः 'a vehicle' (lit. by which men are carried); व्रजः 'a cow-pen' (by which they go); व्यजः 'a fan' (by which they move the air); the anomaly in this consists in not replacing the अज् of व्यज् (वि + अज्) by the substitute वी as required by _sutra_ (II. 4. 56); आपण 'a market' (lit. that in which men come and traffic); निगमः 'the _Veda_', 'a market' (that into which they enter).\n\nThe force of the word च in the aphorism is to include other words also, which have not been already mentioned. Thus कषः, निकषः 'a touch-stone', (lit. that on which they rub).",
    "33120": "This supersedes घ । The ञ् is indicatory and causes the _vriddhi_ of ॠ (VII. 2. 115) and is also for the sake of regulating the accent (VI. 1. 195), (VI. 1. 197). The indicatory घ् is useful in the subsequent aphorism where it changes the palatals into gutturals. Thus अवतारः 'the descent (or incarnation of a diety); अवस्तारः 'a screen round a tent'.\n\nHow do we apply अवतार also in phrases like अवतारो नद्याः 'the descent of rivers', for here the word _avatara_ is not an appellative? This use is also allowed, because the _anuvritti_ of the word प्राय is understood here also; so that those words _avatara_ &c. may be employed in senses other than appellative.",
    "33121": "The whole of the phrase within brackets is to be read into this _sutra_ from _sutra_ (III. 3. 118). This excludes घ. Thus  लेखः 'a writing' (that in which something is inscribed); वेदः 'the _Veda_' (that by which all is known); वेषः 'dress' (that which is entered into); बन्धः 'obstruction'; मार्गः 'a way' (that on which they seek); अपामार्गः 'a plant' (that by which disease or the like is cleared away); रामः '_Rama_' (i. e. in which the devout delight).",
    "33122": "These words are formed by adding the affix घञ् to the exclusion of घ which would have come by rule (III. 3. 118). All these words are derived from roots which end in vowels. Thus अधि + इ + घञ् = अध्यायः 'a chapter or book' (lit. that in which they read); नी--न्यायः 'logic, justice', (lit. that by which men are lead); उत्-यु--उद्यावः 'mixture' (lit. that in which they blend); सम्-हृ--संहारः 'destruction' (lit. by which they are destroyed); आ-धृ-आधारः 'support' (lit. in which anything is held); आ-वि--आवायः = आवयन्ति अस्मिन् ।\n\nThe force of च is to include others not enumerated above; as, अवहारः ।",
    "33123": "The word is thus formed: उत् + अञ्च + घञ् = उदङ्कः 'a vessel'.\n\nWould not the affix घञ् have come by _sutra_ (III. 3. 121), why then this aphorism? This is made a separate aphorism in order to prohibit the application of the affix, where the word to be formed means 'water'.\n\nThus तैलोदङ्कः 'a leathern vessel for oil'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not referring to 'water'? Observe उदकोदञ्चनः 'a bucket for drawing water' (उद् + अञ्च + ल्युट्).\n\nWhy do not we give the counter-example by adding the affix घ to the root उदञ्च्? Because the form evolved by applying घ, would be the same in every respect as that evolved by घञ्; even the accent would be the same. For by _sutra_ (VI. 2. 144), the _udatta_ accent, in the case of घञ्, will fall on the final.",
    "33124": "The word is thus formed in the sense of instrument. आ + नो + घञ् = आनायः 'a net' (by which they are caught); as आनायो मत्स्यानां 'a net for fish'; आनायो मृगाणाम् 'a net for wild deer &c'.",
    "33125": "The affix घञ् has been read into the _sutra_ by force of the word च । Thus आखानः or आखनः 'a spade, a hoe'.\n\nVart:- The affix ड also comes in this sense after the verb खन्. Thus आखन् + ड = आखः 'a spade'. The indicatory ड् showing that the final portion called टि should be elided.\n\nVart:- The affix डर also comes in the same sense; as आखरः 'a spade'.\n\nVart:- So also the affix इक्ः; as आखनिकः 'a spade'.\n \nVart:- So too the affix इकवक as आखनिकवकः 'a spade'.",
    "33126": "The _anuvritti_ of the phrase 'when related as instrument or location' ceases with this aphorism. The word कृच्छ्र means heavy, and दुर् has the force of conveying that sense. The word अकृच्छ्र means 'light, easy'; and the words ईषत् and सु convey that sense. Thus ईषत्करो भवता कटः 'a mat is made easily by you'; so also दुष्करः 'made with difficulty'; सुकरः 'made with ease'. Similarly ईषद्भोजः 'eating pleasantly'; दुर्भोजः and सुभोजः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'after ईषत् &c'.? See कृच्छ्रेण कार्यः कटः 'the mat which is made with difficulty'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning 'hard or light'? Observe ईषत्कार्यं 'a small work'.\n\nOf the affix खल्, the letter ख and ल् are indicatory; ख causing the insertion of a nasal (technically called मुम् augment, (VI. 3. 67)); and ल् regulates the accent (VI. 1. 196). The augment मुम् will be added in the subsequent _sutra_, the ख thus having no work in this _sutra_.",
    "33127": "Thus ईषदाढ्यं भवं 'being enriched easily'; दुराढ्यं भवम् 'to be enriched with difficulty'; स्वाढ्यङ्करो देवदत्तो भवता '_Devadatta_ can be made rich by you easily'.\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the agent and object in composition should be, as if they ended in the affix च्वि (V. 4. 50). Compare (III. 2. 56) and (III. 2. 57.) &c. Therefore we do not have it here स्वाढ्येन भूयते or आढ्येन सुभूयते ॥",
    "33128": "The word ईषद् &c. are to be read into this _sutra_, not so the words कर्तृकर्मणा &c. This supersedes the affix खल्. Thus ईषत्पानः सोमो भवता 'the _soma_ juice can be lightly drunk by you'; दुष्पानः 'difficult to be drunk'; सुपानः 'easy to be drunk'. ईषद्दानो गौर्भवता 'the cow can be given with ease by you'; दुर्दानः सुदानः &c.",
    "33129": "This debars the affix खल्. Thus सूपसदनोऽग्निः । सूपसदनमन्तरिक्षम् । See T.S. 7. 5. 20. I",
    "33130": "Thus सुदोह नाम कृणोद् ब्रह्मणे गां; so also सुवेद नाम कृणोद् ब्रह्मणे गां ॥ (_Rig_. _Veda_. X. 112. 8).\n\nVart:- In the modern Sanskrit, the affix '_yuch_' comes after the verbs, आस्, युध्, दृश्, धृष्, and मृष्; as दुःशासनः '_Duhsasana_'; दुर्योधनः '_Duryodhana_'; दुर्दर्शनः, दुर्द्धर्षणः and दुर्मर्षणः ।",
    "33131": "The words समीप and सामीप्य are the words with the same signification, the latter being derived from the first by adding the affix ष्यङ्. This affix is added with a self-descriptive force, without making any modification in the meaning. We learn thus incidentally from _Panini_'s using the word सामीप्य, that the affix ष्यङ् also comes with a self -descriptive (_svartha_) force, and the words चातुर्वर्ण्यः &c. are thus formed.\n\nThe affixes which begin with _sutra_ (III. 2. 123) (वर्तमाने लट्) and end with (III. 3. I) (उणादय बहुलं,) are affixes which come in denoting the present time. These affixes come also with the force of the past or future time, when the sense is that the action has just taken place, or will immediately take place. Thus, to the question कदा देवदत्ताऽगतोसि 'when didst thou come _Devadatta_', it may, be replied, either अयमागच्छामि 'I come now', or आगच्छन्तमेव मां विद्धि 'know me even to have come'; or अयमागमम् 'I have now come'; or एषोस्म्यागतः 'I have come now'. So also to the question कदा देवदत्त गमिष्यसि 'when will you go _Devadatta_', it may be replied, either एष गच्छामि 'I go now' or गच्छन्तमेव मां विद्धि or एष गमिष्यामि or गन्तास्मि &c.\n\nThe phrase 'in like manner' (वत्) has been employed to indicate complete resemblance; that is to say, with whatever qualifications, the affixes have been enjoined to denote present time, namely, with whatever bases (प्रकृति), and words in compositions (उपपद), and restrictive significations (उपाधि), certain affixes have been enjoined;-the same affixes under those conditions and those circumstances, only will denote also immediate future and recent past. Thus शानन् by rule (III. 2. 128) comes after the _prakritis_ पू and यज् in forming present participles; this affix, to denote past and future, must come only after पू and यज्, and so on. Thus पवमानः, यजमानः, अलङ्करिष्णुः (III. 2. 136) &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'not remote from the present, (सामीप्य)'? This rule will not apply when distant future or distant past is intended to be expressed. As परुद् अगच्छत् पाटलिपुत्रम् 'he went day before yesterday to _Pataliputra_'; वर्षेण गमिष्यति 'he will go in a year'.\n\nOne may say that \"the word गच्छामि can denote by itself nothing but the present tense, and it is because it occurs in a sentence in connection with other qualifying words, that it is made to denote any other time; and it is a well-known fact that a tense which a sentence as a whole may indicate, has no bearing on the question as to what tense a verb must take, when we are preparing it for taking a grammatical tense; and hence the present _sutra_ is superfluous\". To such we reply that the present _sutra_ and those that follow are not meant for those who know the proper idioms of Sanskrit language; but for those only who do not know this.\n\nDr. Bohtlingk translates this _sutra_ thus:-- 'Whatever is near to the present time, may be expressed as a present tense'.",
    "33132": "The word 'optionally' is understood here also. The phrase 'not remote from the present' is not valid in this aphorism. The word आशंसा means the wish or expectation of getting an object not yet obtained, and consequently this can refer only to future time. The force of च is to draw the word वर्त्तमानवत् from the last _sutra_ in this aphorism. This _sutra_ has been thus put by Mr. _Apte_:--\"When hope is expressed in a conditional form, the Aorist (लुङ्), the Present, or Simple Future is used in both the clauses to denote a future time. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदगमत् or आगतः, or आगच्छति or आगमिष्यति वा एते व्याकरणमध्यगीष्महि, or अधीतवन्तः or अधीमहे or अध्येष्यामहे 'if the teacher were to come, we should read grammar'.\n\nThis construction is possible only when the past tense is expressed by लुङ् (Aorist); and not by लङ् or लिट्. For लुङ् denotes past time in general, while लङ् and लिट् denote particular forms of past time; (see (III. 2. 110)), (III. 2. 111) and (III. 2. 115). The phrase भूतवत् making an analogy with time in general, will not therefore, refer to लिट् or लङ् which refer to past time in special.\n\nWhy say 'when hope is expressed'? Observe आगमिष्यति 'he will come'.",
    "33133": "This supersedes the last rule by which Aorist could also have been employed. By the present rule the Second Future can only be employed. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेत्क्षिप्रमागमिष्यति (or उपाध्यायश्चेदागतः--_Apte_.) क्षिप्रं व्याकरणमध्येष्यामहे 'if the teacher were to come soon, we shall soon learn grammar'.\n\nBy force of the word वचन in the aphorism, we take the synonyms of क्षिप्र also, such as शीघ्रं, आशु, त्वरितम्, &c. \n\nAn objector might say, \"the use of the word लृट् in the _sutra_ is redundant; for Future tense is the natural tense to be used, whenever hope is indicated. _Sutra_ (III. 3. 132) was merely an exception to this rule; so that the present _sutra_ re-enacting the general rule, ought to have been worded thus;-- न क्षिप्रवचने 'not so when a word expressing quickness is employed'; for such a rule debarring the past tenses given by (III. 3. 132), would have, of necessity, given scope to the Future tense which is the natural tense to express hope\". To them we say, that there are two future tenses, लृट् and लुट् । By specifying लृट् we mean that लुट् should not be employed even where it would otherwise have come, such as in the following:- श्वः क्षिप्रमध्येष्यामहे 'to-morrow we shall learn soon'.",
    "33134": "This is also an _apavada_ of rule (III. 3. 132), and teaches the employment of the Potential with a future force. Thus उपाध्यायश्चेदागच्छेद्, आशंसेयुक्तोऽधीयीय 'if the teacher will come, I hope, you will study with diligence'. This being a subsequent rule, will apply even when the words expressive of 'quickness' are in composition. Thus आशंसे क्षिप्रमधीयीय 'I hope, you will learn soon'. So also, अवकल्पये युक्तोऽधीयीय, &c.",
    "33135": "The affixes लङ् (Imperfect Past) and लुट् (First Future), have been ordained to come, when past time not belonging to the current day, and future time not belonging to the current day, are respectively indicated. The present _sutra_ prohibits these two affixes. The word क्रियाप्रबन्धः means 'performing an action with continuity'; and सामीप्य means 'not remoteness of time, immediateness, without the intervention of anything of the same genus'. Thus यावज्जीवं भृशमन्नमदात् (not अददात्) 'he gave food throughout his life'; or भृशमन्नं दास्यति 'he will give much food'. यावज्जीवं पुत्रोप्यापिपत् 'throughout his life he taught', or यावज्जीवमध्यापयिष्यति  'throughout his life he will teach'. In both these cases the Aorist and the Second Future are used instead of the Imperfect and the First Future.\n\nSo also when recent past or immediate future is meant, the Aorist and the Second Future are employed, instead of the Imperfect and the First Future. Thus येयं पौर्णमास्यतिक्रान्ता, एतस्यामुपाध्यायोग्नीनाधित or सोमेनायष्ठ or गामदित 'during the full-moon that has just past, the teacher consecrated the fire, or performed the _soma_-sacrifice or gave a cow'. Here the Aorist is for the Imperfect. येयममावास्याऽऽगामिनी, एतस्यामुपाध्यायोग्नीनाधास्यते or सोमेन यक्ष्यते, or स गां दास्यते 'on the next new-moon day, the teacher will perform the fire-sacrifice or the _soma_-sacrifice, or he will give a cow'. Here the Second Future is employed instead of the First Future.\n\nThe double negative न अनद्यतन 'not non-today' implies the proper corresponding tenses which indicate _adyatana_.",
    "33136": "The phrase नानद्यतनवत् is valid in this _sutra_ also. The two conditions of the last aphorism, namely, 'continuity of action' and 'immediateness', however, do not apply here. Thus योऽयमध्वागन्तव्य आपाटलिपुत्रात्तस्य यदवरं कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्रोदनं भोक्ष्यामहे, तत्र सक्तून्पास्यामः 'on this side of the road from the city of _Kosambi_ to the city of _Pataliputra_, there we will eat rice, and there we will drink _saktu_'.\n\nWhy do we say 'in denoting future time'? Observe योऽयमध्वागत आपाटलिपुत्रात् तस्य कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्यैमहि 'on this side of the road that leads from the city of _Kosambi_ to the city of _Pataliputra_, we read together &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'when signifying limit'? Observe योऽयमध्वानिरवधिकगन्तव्यस्तस्य यदवरं कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्रोदनं भोक्तास्महे, सक्तून् पातास्मः । Here the First Future is employed.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the word अवर is in construction'? Observe योऽयमध्वागन्तव्य आपाटलिपुत्रात् तस्य यत्परं कौशाम्ब्यास्तत्रोदनं भोक्तास्महे &c.\n \nThe examples of limit given in this aphorism, refer to local limit; in the subsequent _sutras_ examples will be given as to the limit of time and some difference will be observed therein.",
    "33137": "The whole of the last _sutra_ should be read into this. The difference between this and the last _sutra_ is, that _sutra_ (III. 3. 136) referred both to the limit of space and time, while _sutra_ (III. 3. 137) refers to the limit of time only; moreover with regard to time, there is exception with regard to the portions of day and night. The _yoga_-_vibhaga_, the separation of this _sutra_ from the last, is for the sake of subsequent aphorisms. Thus योऽयं संवत्सर आगामी तत्र यदवरमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र अध्येष्यामहे 'in the month of _Chaitra_, the year after next, we shall read together'; तत्रोदनं भोक्ष्यामहे 'we shall eat rice then &c'.\n\nThis construction is, of course, only valid in denoting future time, otherwise not. Therefore not here: योऽयं वत्सरोऽतीतस्तस्य यदवरमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्यैमहि 'in the month of _Chaitra_, the year before last, we read together'; तत्रौदनमभुञ्जमहि 'we ate together &c'.\n\nWhy do we say 'limit'? Observe योऽयं निरवधिकः काल आगामी तस्य यदवरमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्येतास्महे--तत्रोदनं भोक्तास्महे ।\n\nThe limit must be 'on this side i. e. अवर side'. With the वर side limit, this rule will not apply. With the word पर, this construction is optional. See the next _sutra_.\n\nWhy do we say 'when not divisions of day and night'? There are three sorts of counter-examples in this case; as, योऽयं मास आगामी तस्य योऽवरः पञ्चदशरात्रः or योऽयं  त्रिंशद्रात्र आगामी तस्य योऽवरोर्द्धमासः or योऽयं त्रिंशदहोरात्र आगामी तस्य योऽवरः पञ्चदशरात्रस्तत्र युक्ता अध्येतास्महे तत्र सक्तून् पातास्मः । Here _Lut_; or First Future has been employed and not the Second Future.",
    "33138": "The whole of the last aphorism must be read into this: The _sutra_ will then stand thus: \"The Second and the First Futures are optionally both employed in denoting future time, not belonging to the current day, instead of the First Future alone, when the word पर is used signifying a limit of time on that side of a fixed period, provided that this word does not give the sense of day or night\".\n\nThis rule allows an option when the time refers to the पर side of a starting limit. Thus योऽयं संवत्सर आगामी तस्य यत् परमाग्रहायण्यास्तत्र युक्ता अध्येष्यामहे or अध्येतास्महे 'we will read together in the month of _Chaitra_, the year after next'.\n\nAll the counter-examples given under the last aphorism, are also valid here by substituting the word पर instead of अवर.",
    "33139": "The words 'in denoting future time' are here. The reasons for affix लिङ् are such as cause and effect &c. mentioned in _sutra_ (III. 3. 156) and (III. 3. 157) &c. The लृङ् is called the conditional tense. \"It comes in the conditional sentences in which the non-performance of the action is implied; or where the falsity of the antecedent is implied as a matter of fact. It usually corresponds to the English Plu perfect Conditional, and must, in Sanskrit, be used in both the antecedent and the consequent clauses\".-- _Apte_'s Guide.\n\nThus सुवृष्टिश्चेदभविष्यत् तदा सुभिक्षमभविष्यत् 'if there had been good rain, then there would have been plenty of food; or if there were to be good rain then there would be plenty of food'. It is implied that there was not good rain, nor consequent plenty: or that the occurrence of good rain is dubious, and the desirable consequence equally so.\n\nSo also here, दक्षिणेन चेदायास्यन्न शकटं पर्याभविष्यत् 'if he were to go by the right side, the carriage would not be upset'; यदि कमलकम् आह्वास्यन् न शकटं पर्याभविष्यत् 'if he were to call _Kamalaka_ (which he will not), the carriage would not be upset'; आभोक्ष्यत भवान् घृतेन यदि मत्समीपम् आगमिष्यत् 'you would eat food with clarified butter, if you (were to) come to me (but you will not come)'.\n\nAll these sentences refer to future time. The non-upsetting is a future contingency and is an effect the cause of which is the 'calling of _Kamalaka_'. The speaker--having apprehended the cause and effect, and having also learned from other sources that such an effect will not take place, that is to say, that _Kamalaka_ will not be called, and the carriage will be upset-- has employed this conditional tense to express his idea. The whole sentence यदि कमलकम्  &c. really gives this sense:-That both actions, 'the calling' and 'the non-upsetting', which are subjects of a future time, and which are related as cause and effect, will not be completed; that neither _Kamalaka_ will be called, nor the impending fate averted from the carriage. The _sutra_ may also be thus rendered according to Professor Bohtlingk:- In a conditional sentence, which would require a Potential according to (III. 3. 156), is used, if the sense is that of Future time, the Conditional Tense, when the action is not complete.",
    "33140": "The whole of the last aphorism is understood in this. The last _sutra_ enjoined लृङ् in the Future tense; this _sutra_ ordains it in the Past, the Conditional tense having both these significations. The reasons for affixing लिङ् are given in _sutras_ (III. 3. 152) and those that follow it. In _sutra_ (III. 3. 141) and those that follow, as far as (III. 3. 152), optional rules for the employment of the Conditional tense will be given. Thus:- दृष्टो मया भवत्पुत्रोऽन्नार्थी चङ्क्रम्यमाणः अपरश्च द्विजो ब्राह्मणार्थी, यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत्, तदाऽभोक्ष्यत, न तु भुक्तवान्, अन्येन पथा स गतः । 'I saw your son, wandering about in search of food, I saw also a twice-born in search of a _Brahmana_(whom he would feast); if he (your son) had been seen by him (the twice-born), then he would have been fed; but as a matter of fact, he has not been fed, he went by a different road'.\n\nThe conditional sentence यदि स तेन दृष्टोऽभविष्यत् तदाऽभोक्ष्यत is employed under circumstances set out above. It refers to a past time, there is the relation of cause and effect existing, one being in search of food, and another in search of a guest to feed; and the action is not completed; both taking different roads, did not come across each other.",
    "33141": "All the words within brackets must be supplied from the previous _sutras_ to complete the sense. This _sutra_ consists of three words वा 'optionally', आ 'as far as' and उताप्योः (the _sutra_ (III. 3. 152)). The words वा + आ + उ form वो by the rules of conjunction. The particle आ in this aphorism has the force of limit exclusive and not that of limit inclusive. The optional use of the conditional tense will be illustrated in the following aphorisms, where, in addition to the special tenses to be employed by those rules, we may employ the conditional also under those very circumstances, in the alternative, provided that the non-completion of the action is understood. Prof. Bohtlingk translates this aphorism thus: \"optionally so, in connection with उत् and अपि, the conditional tense may be employed\".",
    "33142": "The word गर्हा means 'censure', 'blame'. The affix लट् has been enjoined to come with a present signification, and would not have come to denote time in general, which, however, it does here, for here the Present tense is employed in preference to the tense required by the time of the action, which is totally excluded. Hence the present _sutra_.\n\nThus अपि तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयति 'even your honor sacrifices (or sacrificed or will sacrifice) to a _Sudra_'; जातु तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयति गर्हामहे, अहोअन्याय्यमेतत् 'possibly your honor sacrifices for a _Sudra_'; the sense implied being that such conduct on the part of those men are blameworthy.\n\nIn the present case, there being no occasion for the application of लिङ्, of course, we cannot employ लृङ् to denote the non-completion of the action.\n \nSo also अपि or जातु जायां त्यजसि ' Fie! you abandon (or abandoned or will abandon) your wife'!",
    "33143": "The word 'censure' is understood, and by च we draw लट् from the previous _sutra_ into this. By using the word 'optionally' in the aphorism, it is indicated that this rule does not exclude the application of the alternative tenses which would otherwise have been required by the time of the action. It is not total exclusion like the last. Thus कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयति or याजयिष्यति 'Indeed, how your honor can (or will) sacrifice for a _Sudra_'.\n\nSo also, कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयिता, अयाजयत् or याजयाञ्चकार ।\n\nHere there is an occasion for the application of the Potential mood (लिङ्); therefore when we intend to express non-completion of action in the past time, we can optionally employ the Conditional also (लृङ्). As कथं नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलम् अयाजयिष्यत् or याजयेत् 'Indeed, why did your honor (attempt to) sacrifice for that _Sudra_ (in vain)'.\n\nUnder similar circumstances, in denoting future time, the Conditional (लृङ्) must invariably be employed (III. 3. 139); as, कथं धर्मम् अत्यजिष्यः 'why will you (attempt to) give up your duty'.",
    "33144": "Here also the Potential and the First Future are employed in preference to the time required by the action.\n\nThe word 'censure' is understood here; not so, however, the word 'optionally'. This excludes all other tense-affixes. The repetition of the word लिङ् in this _sutra_, is for the sake of excluding लट्, whose _anuvritti_ would also have run into this _sutra_, had we taken the _anuvritti_ of लिङ् from the last _sutra_, instead of repeating it. Thus कः कतरो वा हरिं निन्देत्, निन्दिष्यति वा 'who will censure _Hari_'?\n\nIn the Past tense, when the non-completion of action is implied, we may optionally employ the Conditional (लृङ्); and in the Future tense, under similar circumstances, we must employ the Conditional necessarily; as को नाम वृषलो यं तत्र भवानयाजयिष्यत् 'who is the _Sudra_ for whom your honor did sacrifice (in vain)'. This _sutra_ may be rendered thus also:—\" In connection with an Interrogative Pronoun, when censure is implied, may be employed the Potential or the First Future\".",
    "33145": "The _anuvritti_ of the word 'censure' ceases. The word अनवक्लृप्तिः means 'impossibility, not to be believed'. The word अमर्षः means 'not endurable or not to be tolerated'. This excludes all other tenses, the Potential and the 2nd. Future coming in preference to all other tenses required by the time of the action. In the _Dvandva_ Compound अनवक्लृप्त्यमर्षयोः, the word अनवक्लृप्ति ought to have stood as second member of the compound as it contains larger number of syllables than the word अमर्ष (II. 2. 14). The non-compliance with rule (II. 2. 14.) indicates that the rule of यथासङ्ख्यं, (I. 3. 10) does not apply here, which would otherwise have applied-- the sense of the _sutra_ then being 'that the Potential should be employed when the act is not likely to occur, and the 2nd. Future to be used when the act is not to be tolerated'. This is not, however, the interpretation which we should put upon the _sutra_.\n\nThus नावकल्पयामि, न सम्भावयामि, न श्रद्दधे, तत्र भवान् नाम वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयिष्यति 'I do not believe, or think it possible or trust that your honor sacrifices (or sacrificed or will sacrifice) for a _Sudra_'. न मर्षयामि तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् or याजयिष्यति 'I can not tolerate that your honor does (did or will) sacrifice for a _Sudra_'.\n\nWhen past time together with the non-completion of the action is to be expressed, we may optionally employ the Conditional (लृङ्), but necessarily so, when Future time is to be expressed. Thus नावकल्पयामि तत्रभवान् नाम वृषलं अयाजयिष्यत् 'I do not believe that your honor did or will sacrifice for a _Sudra_'.",
    "33146": "The words within brackets must be supplied from the last aphorism. The whole word किङ्किल is to be taken as an _upapada_ and not the word किं and किल separately. This word expresses anger. The words having the sense of _asti_ are अस्ति, भवति and विद्यते । This rule supersedes the Potential (लिङ्). Thus किङ्किल or अस्ति or भवति or विद्यते नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयिष्यति, न मर्षयामि, न श्रद्दधे 'Is it possible that your honor will (or did or does) sacrifice for a _Sudra_ ? I cannot believe or tolerate it'.\n\nAs there is no occasion for लिङ् here, we cannot have the Conditional (लृङ्) required by rule (III. 3. 141).\n\nAnother example is न श्रद्दधे न मर्षये वा किङ्किल त्वं शूद्रान्नम् भोक्ष्यसे 'I do not believe or can tolerate that thou shouldst eat the food of _Sudra_'; अस्ति भवति विद्यते वा शूद्रीं गमिष्यसि 'Is it possible that thou shouldst go to a female _Sudra_'.",
    "33147": "This excludes the First Future or '_Lrit_'. जातु तन्न भवान् वृषलम् याजयेत्, or यन्नाम तत्र भवान् वृषलम् याजयेत्, न श्रद्दधे, न मर्षयामि ।\n\nVart:- The words यदा and यदि should be enumerated along with the words जातु and यत् in this rule. As यदि or यदि वा त्वादृशो हरिं निन्देन्नावकल्पयामि न मर्षयामि 'neither do I think, nor do I tolerate that one like you should blaspheme _Hari_'.\n\nHere also when the non-completion of the action is implied, the Conditional (लृङ्) is necessarily employed in denoting future time, and optionally so in denoting past time. As जातु, यत्, यदा or यदि त्वादृशो हरिं निन्देत् or अनिन्दिष्यन् नावकल्पयामि, न मर्षयामि वा 'neither do I believe, nor do I tolerate that one like you did attempt to blaspheme _Hari_'. यदि सुरभिमवाप्स्यस्तन्मुखोच्छ्वासगन्धम् तव रति रभविष्यत् पुण्डरीके किमस्मिन् 'if you had felt (which you clearly have not) the fragrant smell of her breath, would you have had any liking for this lotus'?",
    "33148": "This supersedes the First Future. The separation of this aphorism from the previous one, is for the sake of the rules that follow. The rule (1. 3. 10) does not also apply here. Thus यच्च यत्र वा त्वमेवं कुर्याः न श्रद्दधे, न मर्षयामि 'I do not think, nor can I tolerate that thou wilt do so'.\n \nThe Conditional (लृङ्) will also be employed under its own proper conditions as shown in the last aphorism.",
    "33149": "The governing force of the words _anavaklipti_ and _amarsha_ ceases. This debars all other tense-affixes. Thus यच्च or यत्र तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् ॠद्धौ वृद्धः सन् ब्राह्मणः, गर्हामहे, अहो अन्याय्यमेतत् 'we blame you who being an opulent, old _Brahmana_ (who ought to know better) officiate as a sacrificial priest for a _Sudra_, O! It is improper'!\n\nWhen the non-completion of the action is indicated, the Conditional tense must be employed under the rules given in (III. 3. 139)- (III. 3. 140)- (III. 3. 141). As यच्च or यत्र त्वं हरिं निन्देः or अनिन्दिष्यः, गर्हामहे 'we censure that you should (have attempted to) blaspheme _Hari_', &c.",
    "33150": "The word चित्रीकरणं means 'wonder, astonishment, strangeness &c'. This debars all the other tense-affixes. Thus यच्च or यत्र तत्र भवान् वृषलं याजयेत् आश्चर्यमेतत् 'this is a wonder that you should sacrifice for a _Sudra_'.\n \nWhen the non-completion of the action is indicated, the Conditional is employed under the rules (III. 3. 139), (III. 3. 140) and (III. 3. 141). Thus आश्चर्यमेतत् यच्च or यत्र त्वं शूद्रं याजयेः or अयाजयिष्यः 'it is a wonder that you should (have attempted to) perform a sacrifice for a _Sudra_'; आश्चर्यमेतत् यच्च or यत्र त्वं शूद्रं अयाजयिष्यः 'it is a wonder that you should (hereafter attempt to) make a _Sudra_ perform a sacrifice'.",
    "33151": "In all other cases, that is to say, in cases where the words यच्च or यत्र are not employed, as well as where the word यदि is not used, the First Future is used in preference to the Potential.\n\nThus आश्चर्यं, चित्रं, अद्भूतम् अन्धो नाम पर्वतमारोक्ष्यति, बधिरो नाम व्याकरणम् अध्येष्यते 'it is wonderful, strange and astonishing that the blind man should ascend a mountain, or a deaf person should read grammar'.\n\nNot so, when the word यदि is employed. Thus आश्चर्यं यदि सोऽधीयीत 'a wonder, if he study'. आश्चर्यं यदि स भुञ्जीत 'a wonder, if he eat'.\n\nAs there is, in this case, no occasion to employ the Potential, we cannot employ the Conditional as directed in _sutras_ (III. 3. 139), (III. 3. 140) and (III. 3. 141).",
    "33152": "This excludes all the other tense-affixes. The meaning which is common both to उत and अपि is that of बाढम् 'assuredly, certainly, surely, really'. Thus उत कुर्यात् 'certainly he does'; अपि कुर्यात् 'assuredly he does' उताधीयीत 'certainly he studies (will study &c)'; अप्यधीयीत 'surely he studies &c'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when they mean certainly'? Observe उत दण्डः पतिष्यति 'will the stick fall'? अपि द्वारं धास्यति 'he shuts the door'. Here उत is employed in asking questions, and अपि with धा means 'to shut'. The option allowed by rule (III. 3. 141.) ceases. Hereafter the Conditional (लृङ्) must invariably be used even in indicating Past action, when action is not completed, and there is reason for the employment of लिङ्(Potential). In indicating Future time, of course, लङ् must necessarily be employed as before. Henceforward, therefore, no option is allowed, but लृङ् must be employed where _sutras_ (III. 3. 139) and (III. 3. 140) require it.",
    "33153": "The phrase कामप्रवेदना means the expression of one's wish. This debars all other tense-affixes. As कामो मे भुञ्जीत भवान् = अभिलाषो मे भुञ्जीत भवान् 'it is my wish that you will eat'.\n\nWhy do we say 'except the word कच्चित्'? Observe कच्चिज्जीवति ते माता कच्चिज्जीवति ते पिता । माराविद त्वां पृच्छामि कच्चिज्जीवति पार्वती ॥ 'I hope thy mother is living, I hope thy father is living, I ask thee, O _maravid_ ! (Parrot), I hope that _Parvati_ is living'.",
    "33154": "The word लिङ् is understood here. The word सम्भावन means supposition and expectation in the power or ability of another to perform any action. This word is here qualified by the sense of the word अलं. The word अलं means 'adequate'; so that the above-mentioned सम्भावनं must be completed, full and true i.e. realised. The phrase सिद्धाप्रयोगे qualifies अलं, and means 'if the non-employment or omission of अलं is valid or unobjectionable. When is that unobjectionable, when the sense of अलं is implied by the sentence, but this word itself is not used? The Potential Mood is employed when the expectation is of the kind above described. This rule debars all other tense-affixes. Thus अपि पर्वतं शिरसा भिन्द्यात् 'l expect he will break even the hill with his head'; अपि द्रोणपाकं भुञ्जीत 'I expect you will eat away even a _drona_ of cooked food'.\n\nWhy do we use the word अलं 'competent to do'? Observe, विदेशस्थायी देवदत्त प्रायेण गमिष्यति ग्रामम् 'I expect _Devadatta_ who is living in a foreign country, will some day go back to his country'. Here though 'expectation' is expressed the idea conveyed by अलं, namely, the power to do something or adequacy to do is not present; and hence the Future is employed instead of the Potential.\n\nWhy do we use the phrase सिद्धाप्रयोगे 'when the actual result does not take place'? Observe, अलं देवदत्तो हस्तिनं हनिष्यति '_Devadatta_ is in a position to kill the elephant, and he will carry it out also'.\n\nUnder similar circumstances, in past and future times, when non-completion of action is indicated, the Conditional tense (लृङ्) must be invariably used in preference to every other tense. Professor Bohtlingk translates the _sutra_ thus: “The Potential is employed when it is expressed that some one is believed to be capable of doing something, pre-supposing that the actual performance of the action does not take place“.",
    "33155": "The whole of the last _sutra_ qualifies this _sutra_; the 'expectation' indicated here being of the kind mentioned in the last _sutra_ and governed by the conditions laid down in that aphorism. The word by which an 'expectation' is expressed such as सम्भावय अपि, or अपिनाम, is called सम्भावन-वचन. This _sutra_ enjoins an option where by the last aphorism, there would have been necessarily the Potential Tense. Thus सम्भावयामि भुञ्जीत or भोक्ष्यते भवान् 'I expect you will eat'; अवकल्पयामि भुञ्जीत or भोक्ष्यते भवान् 'I hope you will eat'; श्रद्दधे भुञ्जीत or भोक्ष्यते भवान् 'I believe you will eat'. But no option is allowed, and the Potential must necessarily be used, when the word यत् is employed. As सम्भावयामि यद् भुञ्जीत भवान् 'I expect you will eat'.\n\nThe _sutra_ may also be rendered thus. \"The Potential is not necessarily employed where there is in connection with it a verb in the sense of 'to hold as possible', but not when यद् is employed.\"",
    "33156": "The word हेतु means 'cause' or 'condition' and हेतुमत् means 'consequence or effect'. This supersedes all other tense-affixes; in other words, 'in conditional sentences in which one statement is made to depend upon another as its reason or ground, the Potential is used in both the antecedent and the consequent, otherwise called the protasis (हेतु) and apodosis (हेतुमत्), the former containing the condition or ground of argument, and the latter the conclusion based upon it'. Thus :- दक्षिणेन चेद्यायान्न शकटम् पर्याभवेत् 'if he go by the right side, the cart will not be upset'; यदि कमलकम् आहूयेन्न शकटम् पर्याभवेत् 'if he calls _Kamalaka_, the cart will not be upset'. Here 'going by the right side' is the protasis (हेतु), and 'not-upsetting' the apodosis (हेतुमत्).\n\nThis is an optional use of the Potential; we may use the Second Future in the alternative; thus दक्षिणेन चेद् यास्यति न शकटं पर्याभविष्यति 'if he goes by the south, the cart will not be upset'.\n\nThe word विभाषा 'optionally' used in the _sutra_ immediately preceding is also understood here.\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of लिङ् could have been taken from the last aphorisms, its repetition here is for the sake of pointing out the particular time, namely, the Future, in which the Potential should be employed. Therefore it is not employed in the following sentences: हन्तीति पलायते 'he kills, therefore he flies'; वर्षति इति धावति 'it rains, therefore he runs'.\n\nIt, of course, follows that when the non-completion of the action is indicated, the Conditional (लृङ्) should be employed, under these very circumstances. See examples under _sutra_ (III. 3. 139).",
    "33157": "This supersedes all other tense-affixes. When words expressing 'wish', such as इष्, कम्, प्राथ &c, are used, the Potential or Imperative is used; thus of इच्छामि कामये or प्रार्थये भुञ्जीत भवान् or भुङ्क्तां भवान् 'I wish, desire or pray that your honor may eat'.\n\nVart:- It is only when a desire is expressed that Potential or Imperative should be employed and not merely when the verb 'to wish' or its synonyms are in composition. Therefore the Potential or Imperative are not used here: इच्छन् करोति 'wishing, he does'.\n\nThe _sutra_ may be rendered thus: 'In connection with a verb in the sense of 'wishing' the Potential or the Imperative may be employed.",
    "33158": "Thus इच्छति, वष्टि or वाञ्छति भोक्तुम् 'he desires to eat'; कामयते भोक्तुम् 'he wishes to eat'; पिनाकपाणिं पतिम् आप्तुम् इच्छति 'desires to obtain for her husband the _Pinaka_-handed God _Siva_'.\n\nBut why do we say 'when the agent of the Infinitive and the verb are the same'? We can not say देवदतं भोक्तुम् इच्छति यज्ञदत्तः '_Yajnadatta_ wishes _Devadatta_ to eat'; for here the agents of भुज् and इष् are not the same. We must say, भुञ्जानम् instead of भोक्तुम् ।\n\nWhy do not we use it here:- इच्छन् करोति 'wishing, he does'? Because the Infinitive is never found in such constructions. In other words, the Infinitive in तुम् is employed when both the verbs have the same agent.",
    "33159": "Under similar conditions, with words implying 'wish', the Potential is used in the sense of the Infinitive; Thus भुञ्जीय इति इच्छति 'he wishes that he may eat'; अधीयीयेतीच्छति 'he wishes that he will read'.\n\nWhen the non-completion of the action is implied, the Conditional must be employed under rule (III. 3. 139).",
    "33160": "This ordains लिङ् where there would have been otherwise लट्. Thus इच्छति or इच्छेत् 'he wishes'; वष्टि or उश्यात्; कामयते or कामयेत ।",
    "33161": "The word विधिः means 'commanding or directing a subordinate'; निमन्त्रणं means 'giving invitation'; आमन्त्रणं means 'expressing permission to do as one likes'; अधीष्ठः means 'to politely express a wish'; सम्प्रश्नः means 'a question'; and प्रार्थना means 'a prayer'.\n\nThis excludes all other tense-affixes. Thus:--\n\n(1)\tकटं कुर्यात् 'let him make the mat'; ग्रामम् भवान् आगच्छेत् 'you come to the village';\n\n(2 and 3) इह भवान् भुञ्जीत 'you will or may dine here'; इह भवान् आसीत 'here you will or may sit';\n\n(4) अधीच्छामो भवन्तं माणवकं भवानुपनयेत 'we wish that you should condescend to initiate this boy';\n\n(5) किं भो व्याकरणमधीयीय उत तर्कम् ? 'Sir, what shall I learn, the Grammar or the Logic'?\n\n(6) भवति मे प्रार्थना व्याकरणं अधीयीय 'this is my prayer that I should learn Grammar'.",
    "33162": "The Imperative Mood is employed also under the circumstances mentioned in the last aphorism. The division of this aphorism from the last, is for the sake of subsequent _sutras_ in which the _anuvritti_ of लोट् only runs and not those of others. Thus :--\n\n(1) कटं तावद् भवान् करोतु 'make the mat'; ग्रामं भवान् आगच्छतु ।\n\n(2 and 3) अमुत्र भवान् आस्ताम् 'there you are invited to, or you may, sit'. \n\n(4) पुत्रम्भवान् अध्यापयतु 'you will teach, I hope, the son'.\n\n(5) किं भो वेदमध्ययै उत तर्कं 'Sir what shall I learn, the Veda or the Logic'?\n\n(6) भवति मे प्रार्थना व्याकरणमध्ययै छन्दोऽध्ययै 'this is my prayer that I may learn the Grammar, or that I may learn the Prosody'.",
    "33163": "The word प्रैष means 'direction'; अतिसर्गः means 'permission to do as one likes'; प्राप्तकालः means 'arrival of appropriate occasion or time for the doing of an action'. The force of च is to introduce the word लोट् into this aphorism. Thus भवता कटः करणीयः, कर्तव्यः, or कृत्यः or कार्यः 'you must, (may, or it is proper time for you to) make the mat'.\n\nSo instead of the Passive Potential Participles, for such the _Kritya_ affix (III. 1. 95) &c)) may properly be called; we may have the Imperative also. Thus करोतु कटं  'you must (may or it is the appropriate time to) make the mat'.\n \nIt might be asked 'Why the _kritya_ affixes are enjoined to come with the force of direction, permission &c'. They have been ordained most generically to come in denoting action in the Abstract (भाव) and object (कर्म) and a fortiori they will come in denoting the senses of direction, permission & c; for the latter are but a species of action. If you say that लोट् being ordained in these special senses, will (on the principle, that an _apavada_ or special rule excludes an _utsarga_ or general rule within the jurisdiction of such special rule) exclude _kritya_ affixes; we would reply, that _kritya_ affixes will not be excluded, for the rule of non-uniform affixes (III. 1. 94) will apply'.\n\nTo this objection we answer 'the special mention of the word _kritya_ in this _sutra_, indicates the existence of the following maxim :--\n\n'The rule of non-uniform affixes (III. 1. 94) does not necessarily apply in all cases after _sutra_ (III. 3. 94) treating of primary affixes by which feminine nouns are formed'.\n\nQ.-- What is the difference between the words विधि and प्रैष ? Some say विधि means a precept enjoining something for the first time; while प्रैष means mere 'direction'.",
    "33164": "The words प्रैष &c. of the last _sutra_ must be read into this. The force of च is to introduce the words कृत्या and लोट् from the last _sutra_, into this. Thus ऊर्ध्वं मुहूर्त्तादुपरि मुहूर्तस्य भवता खलु कठः कर्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः, or भवान् खलु कटं कुर्यात (Potential) or करोतु (Imperative). 'You may make the mat after an Indian hour'; or 'you must &c', or 'it is proper time for you to make a mat just now'. Compare (III. 3. 9).",
    "33165": "This supersedes the Potential (लिङ्) and Potential Passive Participles (कृत्या). Thus ऊर्ध्वम् मुहूर्ताद् भवान् कटं करोतु स्म, ग्रामं गच्छतु स्म, माणवकमध्यापयतु स्म 'you (may, must, or it is proper time to) make the mat, or go to the village, or teach _Manavaka_ just now'.",
    "33166": "The word स्म is understood here. The word अधीष्ट has already been explained in _sutra_ (III. 3. 161). This rule supersedes the Potential. Thus अङ्ग स्म राजन् माणवकमध्यापय or अङ्ग स्म राजन्नग्निहोत्रं जुहुधि 'O! King! I wish that you teach the boy or make _Agnihotra_ sacrifice'.",
    "33167": "Thus कालो भोक्तुम् 'time to eat'; समयः खलु स्नानभोजने सेवितुम् 'it is time to bathe and take food'; वेला भोक्तुम् 'time to eat'. In short, Infinitive in तुमुन् may be used with words meaning 'time'; as अवसरोऽयमात्मानं प्रकाशयितुम् 'this is, indeed, the time to show myself'.\n\nWhy do not we use the Infinitive here? कालः पचति भूतानि 'time devours all creatures'. The sense of 'direction &c'. is understood in the _sutra_; so when 'direction &c' is not meant, the Infinitive will not be used.\n\nWhy do not we use the Infinitive here, कालो भोजनस्य 'proper time to eat'? Because, by the rule of non-uniform affixes (III. 1. 94), we can use also the affix ल्युट् (by which the word भोजन is formed). As we have already in _sutra_ (III. 3. 163) that after _sutras_ (III 1. 113) and forward, namely, in other _sutras_ than those treating of feminine affixes, the rule of (III. 1. 94) may be employed as an _Anitya_ or a non-universal rule.",
    "33168": "This ordains the Potential and supersedes the Infinitive in '_tumun_'. Thus कालः, समयः, वेला वा यद् भवान् भुञ्जीत 'it is time that your honor should take your meals'.",
    "33169": "The force of च is to introduce the Potential (लिङ्) into this, from the last. Thus भवता खलु कन्या वोढव्या वाह्या or वहनीया, (_kritya_); or भवान् खलु कन्यया वोढा (_trich_); or भवान् खलु कन्यां वहेत् (_lin_) 'your honor is fit to marry the girl'.\n\nWhy specifically enjoin '_kritya_' and '_trich_' in the sense of fitness? They being enjoined universally, would a fortiori, be applied when fitness is to be denoted ? Because the लिङ् being specially enjoined to denote fitness, and being an _Apavada_, would have debarred _kritya_ and _trich_, which being universal affixes, would give way. Nor can we, to prevent this contingency, take shelter under rule (III. 1. 94) of 'non-uniform affixes', for we have seen that that rule is not universally valid.",
    "33170": "Thus अवश्यं कारी 'must be done'. The compounding here takes place by (II. 1. 72). So also शतं दायी 'ought to be given a hundred'; सहस्रं दायी; निष्कं दायी &c.",
    "33171": "Thus भवता खलु अवश्यं कटः कर्त्तव्यः, करणीयः, कार्यः or कृत्यः 'you ought to make the mat'; भवता शतं दातव्यं, देयं, &c, 'you ought to pay a hundred'.\n\nQ.-- Where is the necessity of this aphorism ? The _kritya_ affixes, being enjoined universally without any limitation would, of course, come under these special circumstances also.\n\nA.-- They would be excluded by the special affix णिनि of the last _sutra_, which comes especially with the force of 'necessity' and 'obligation'.\n\nQ.-- Not so, for णिनि comes in denoting the 'agent' (कर्ता), while _kritya_ denotes the 'action' (भाव) and the 'object' (कर्म); so their scope being different, how can one supersede the other ?\n\nA.-- Well, to remove this objection, some say, that _kritya_ words like भव्य, गेय &c. (III. 4. 68) which especially refer to the agent, are the proper examples to be given under this aphorism; and not examples of _kritya_-formed words in general.",
    "33172": "The word 'capability' qualifies the root so that the sense of capability must be inherent in the root; Thus भवता खलु भारो वोढव्यः, वहनीयः, वाह्यः (_kritya_), or भवान् खलु भारं वहेत् 'you can carry the load'.\n\nThough _kritya_-affixes would have come in this sense, even without any special rule, for they are general affixes, their special mention in this _sutra_ is to guard against their being superseded by लिङ्, for rule (III. 1. 94) is not universally valid.",
    "33173": "The word आशीस् means the wish to obtain an object which one desires, a blessing, an expression of one's good wishes. The लिङ् here referred to is what is known as the आशीर्लिङ् or the Benedictive tense. Its conjugation is different from the conjugation of the ordinary लिङ् which we have called the Potential or Optative; as चिरं जीव्याद् भवान् or चिरं जीवतु भवान् 'may you live long'!\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting benediction'. Observe चिरं जीवति देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ lives long'.",
    "33174": "The affixes therefore, 'give the sense of the agent, with the addition that the action is simply the object of a prayer of some one who wishes that that may be the action of that agent, the sense being simply appellative'. Thus तन्तिः = तनुतात् 'a weaver' (lit. may he weave); सातिः or सतिः = सनुतात् (VI. 4. 45) 'wealth or gift'; भूतिः = भवतात् 'success'; मन्मिः = मनुतात् 'respect'. These are examples of words formed by the affix क्तिच् । Of words formed by क्त in this sense, we have देवदत्तः = देवा एनं देयासुः _Devadatta_ (lit. may the Gods give him). Though the affix क्त has already once been generally ordained, its repetition here is to prevent its being superseded by क्तिच् । The च् of क्तिच् is qualifying only, distinguishing it from क्तिन् &c. and is useful in _sutra_ (VI. 4. 39).",
    "33175": "This sets aside all other tense-affixes. As मा कार्षीत् 'let him not do' मा हार्षीत् 'Iet him not take'.\n\nHow have we then the Imperative and the Future tenses in the following sentence instead of the Aorist ? मा भवतु तस्य पापं मा भविष्यति । This sentence is against good usage. Or, we may explain it by saying that there is another मा which has not the indicatory ङ; and with that मा, other tenses may be used. The augment is elided after the prohibitive participle मा, by (VI. 4. 74).",
    "33176": "By च we introduce लुङ् into the aphorism. Thus मास्म करोत् or कार्षीत् 'let him not make'; मास्म हरत् or हार्षीत् 'let him not take'.",
    "34001": "The above _sutra_ is thus translated by Professor Bohtlingk:- \"Words formed with affixes stand, (in reference to the time) in closer relation to the verb (with which they are allied)\". Thus (III. 2. 85) has taught that words like अग्निष्टोमयाजिन् have a past significance, i.e. they denote a person who has already performed the ceremony of _Agnishtoma_. According to the present _sutra_, in spite of this past significance, inherent in the word, one may use this word with a future tense, whereby it is reduced to a future-denoting word. Thus अग्निष्टोमयाज्यस्य पुत्रो जनिता means 'to him a son will be born who will perform the said _Agnishtoma_ sacrifice'.\n\nThe above is not a literal translation but rather an adaptation. The literal translation will be something like this. \"Affixes are employed in denoting relation (सम्बन्ध) between the senses of verbs\". The word धातुसम्बन्ध is a Genitive Compound meaning 'relation of root'. The word धातु 'root' is figuratively used for धात्वर्थ 'sense of root'; so that the above compound means 'relation of the senses of roots'. In other words, the relation between the roots should be that of qualifier and the qualified. When there exists such a relation between the senses of two verbs, namely, that of qualifier and the thing qualified, then the affixes may be employed in denoting other times than that specifically ordained for them. In other words, to quote from the Guide to _Panini_: \"It is to be observed, that when primitive words are joined with verbs so as to qualify them, the time of the verbs being mainly the time that controls the sentence, any time denoted by the primitive affixes, by which the former words have been formed will be subordinate to and regulated by, but need not correspond to, the time of the verbs, so far as the form of those words is concerned.\"\n\nThus तत्र वसन् ददर्श 'living there, he saw'; अग्निष्टोमयाज्यस्य पुत्रो जनिता 'to him a son will be born, a performer of the _Agnishtoma_ sacrifice'; कृतः कटः श्वो भविता 'he will be to-morrow maker of the mat'; भाविकृत्यमासीत् ।\n\nHere, though the time of the action of living denoted by वसन् is present, (III. 2. 124), this action is present only in relation to the action of seeing, and though because the latter action is past, the former action also is past with reference to the speaker or writer, this circumstance does not affect the form of वसन्, which therefore may remain as it is. In other words, 'affixes are related directly to the root, and not to the whole sentence'.\n\nSimilarly the word अग्निष्टोमयाजी is formed by an affix (III. 2. 85) denoting past time, while the word जनिता is in the Future tense. Now, this linking together of a word in the Past tense with a word in the future is a valid usage. Here the time of the qualified verb भविता does not affect the special time of the qualifier _Agnishtomayaji_.\n\nQ.-- Why has the word प्रत्यय been repeated in this _sutra_, when it was understood in this from (III. 1. 1) ? Ans.-- The repetition is for the sake of indicating that affixes which are not ordained to come after roots (धातु), but which are enjoined to come after nouns &c. such as _Taddhita_ affixes, are even valid in other tenses than those in which they have been specifically enjoined when related to a verb. Thus गोमानासीत् 'he was possessed of a cow'; गोमान् भविता 'he will be possessed of a cow'. Here the _Taddhita_ affix मतुप् is added to the noun गो 'cow', with a present signification (V. 2. 94), the word गोमत् meaning 'who has cows' or 'in which there are cows.' This word, गोमत्, however, is related and validly so, to the words आसीत् and भविता—one in the Past tense and the other in the Future.",
    "34002": "Professor Bohtlingk translates this as follows: \"When the repetition of an action is expressed, the Imperative is used, and though the second person singular is used, it may also stand for the second person plural.\"\n\nThe phrase धातुसम्बन्ध of the last _sutra_ is understood here also. The frequency or repetition of an action is called समभिहारः । This word qualifies the sense of the original. In other words, \"when the sense of frequency &c, is understood in connection with the action, this sense not being included in that of the verb, as it may be in the case of a verb from frequentative roots.\"\n\nThis Imperative mood is employed in all Tenses and Persons in connection with all moods. But this peculiar use of the Imperative is confined to the 2nd. person singular and plural _Parasmaipada_ (हि and त); and 2nd. person singular and plural _Atmanepada_ (स्व and ध्वम्). In other words, “the Imperative second person (_Parasmaipada_ and _Atmanepada_) is repeated, though the subject of the main verb be different and the verb be in any tense.\" Thus लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति 'he cuts repeatedly', as if some one was always calling out to him 'cut thou, cut thou'. लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येव इमौ लुनीतः or इमे लुनन्ति 'they cut often and often'. So also लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येव त्वं लुनासि, युवाम् लुनीथः or यूयं लुनीथ 'thou or you two or you all cut repeatedly' as if some one was calling out to you 'cut you, cut you'.\n\nSo also लुनीत लुनीतेत्येव यूयं लुनीथ, अहं लुनामि, अयमलावीत् &c. 'you cut, I cut, he has cut repeatedly', as if some one was calling out to us 'cut ye, cut ye'. Similarly with _Atmanepada_ roots; as अधीष्वाधीष्वेत्येवायमधीते, इमौ अधीयाते, इमे अधीयते &c. 'he or they study hard' as if some one was calling out to them 'study thou, study thou'.\n\nSo also अधीष्वमधीष्वमित्येव यूयमधीध्वे &c. Similarly in every tense, mood and person; as, अधीष्वाधीष्वेत्येवाहमधीये, आवामधीवहे, वयमधीमहे ।\n\nThe Intensive verbs in यङ् also have this meaning of frequency, but there the verb is not repeated, as the sense of frequency there is inherent in the verb; in this case we must repeat the verb to express frequency. See (VIII. 1. 4).\n\nThis use of the Imperative is not found in Literature (Bohtlingk), but in _Marathi_.",
    "34003": "In this case also the terminations of the second person singular and plural _Atmanepada_ and _Parasmaipada_ are employed, namely, हि, स्व, or त and ध्वम् । Thus भ्राष्द्रमट मठमट खदूरमट स्थाल्यपिधानमटेत्येवायमटति or इमावटतः, or इमेऽटन्ति ।\n\nSimilar examples can be formed as in the last aphorism; only the Imperative is not doubled as in the last case.\n\nSimilarly छन्दोऽधीष्व, व्याकरणमधीष्व, निरुक्तमधीष्वेत्येवायमधीते, or इमावधीयाते or इमेऽधीयते 'he or they two or they all learn, learning Prosody, learning Grammar, learning _Nirukta_'.\n\nThis being an optional rule, we have these forms also; व्याकरणमधीते, छन्दोऽधीते, निरुक्तमधीते, इत्येवायमधीते, इमावधीयाते, इमेऽधीयते । छन्दोधीषे, व्याकरणमधीषे, निरुक्तमधीषे, इत्येव त्वमधीषे, युवामधीयाथे, यूयमधीध्वे । छन्दोधीये व्याकरणमधीये, निरुक्तमधीयइत्ये याहमधीये, आवामधीवहे, वयमधीमहे ।",
    "34004": "The examples have already been given under _sutra_ (III. 4. 2). We cannot say लूनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं छिनत्ति; we must use a verb from the root लू 'to cut'. Such as लुनाति, &c. So also अधीष्वाधीष्व takes अधोते only after it and not a synonymous verb like पठति &c.",
    "34005": "Thus ओदनं भुङ्क्ष्व, सक्तून्पिब, धानाः खादेत्येवायमभ्यवहरति 'he takes his meals, eating rice, drinking _saktu_, and tasting fried corn'. Here the verb अभ्यवहरति has a sense common to all the verbs in the Imperative mood. The object of taking the second verb, having the senses common to all the antecedent verbs, is to prevent the repetition of all the previous ones. In the secular vernacular, the brevity, however, is often not approved.",
    "34006": "The words धातुसम्बन्ध and अन्यतरस्याम् are understood here also. By saying 'optionally', other tense-affixes may be similarly employed.\n\nThus देवो देवेभिरागमत् (_Rig_. I. I. 5.) 'O God _Agni_! come hither with the gods'. Here the Aorist आगमत् has the force of the Imperative. ये भूतस्य प्रचेतस इदं तेभ्योऽकरं नमः 'I make salutation &c. &c'. (_Rig_. X. 85. 17). Here अकरं is Aorist (लुङ्) and has the sense of the Present.\n\nSo also अग्निमद्य होतारमवृणीतायं यजमानः। Here लङ् is used instead of लट् ।\n\nSo also अद्या ममार = अद्य म्रियते । Here लिट् is used instead of लट् ।",
    "34007": "Thus in the sense of 'command' &c., he may be employed instead of लिङ्. This is called the Vedic Subjunctive and is peculiar to the Vedas only. Thus जोषिषत् (_Rig_. II. 35. 1) 'may he make us beautiful'. तारिषत् (_Rig_. I. 25. 12) 'may he increase'. पताति विद्युत् (_Rig_. VII. 25. 1) 'may the thunder-bolt fall'. भवाति (_Rig_. V. 37.5) 'may he become'. So also मन्दिषत्, नेता, नेषत्, तक्षिषत्, उदधिं च्यावयाति ।",
    "34008": "The word उपसम्वाद means 'reciprocal agreement, contracting to do'. Thus यदि मे भवानिदं कुर्य्याद् अहमपि भवत इदं दास्यामि 'If you do this for me, I will give this to you'. Agreements like these are called उपसम्वाद; while guessing or inferring the result from a cause is called आशङ्का 'apprehension or fear'.\n\nThus अहमेव पशूनामीशै ॥ मदग्रा एव वो ग्रहा गृह्यान्तै ॥ मद्देवत्यान्येव वः पात्राण्युच्यान्तै ॥ नेज्जिह्यायन्तो (or नेज्जिह्यायन्त्यो) नरकं पताम ॥ (_Nir_. I. II. Bohtlingk) = जिह्माचरणेन नरकपात आशङ्कयते ॥ All the above examples have the sense of Potential, but the Subjunctive (_Let_) must be employed necessarily in these senses and not optionally, which _anuvritti_ was understood in the last _sutra_.",
    "34009": "In the Vedic literature the Infinitive is formed by the above 15 affixes. These, when stripped of their indicatory letters, will be found to consist of the following five affixes :-- (1) से = से, सेन् and क्से ॥ (2) असे = असे, असेन् and कसेन् ॥ (3) अध्यै = अध्यै, अध्यैन्, कध्यै, कध्यैन्, शध्यै and शध्यैन् ॥ (4) तवै ॥ (5) तवे = तवेङ् and तवेन् ।\n\nThe difference in the affixes is made by four indicatory letters, viz. न्, क्, श् and ङ् । The forces of क्, श् and ङ् have already been explained; the indicatory न् makes the word take the _udatta_ accent on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197). Thus से is acute (III. I. 3); सेन् has acute on the first syllable of the word (VI. 1. 197); असे has accent of the affix (III. I. 3); असेन् throws the accent on the first syllable of the word; the indicatory श makes the numbers 11 and 12 _Sarvadhatuka_, and the root takes the proper _Vikarana_ of its class before these affixes; while before तवै, the acute falls both on the first syllable and the last syllable simultaneously (VI. 1. 200), (VI. 2. 51).\n\nBefore going to give examples of these affixes, let us explain what is meant by तुमर्थ 'the sense of the affix तुम्' । The word तुमर्थ is here equivalent to भाव or 'action'; for the _pratyayas_ or affixes, to which no meaning has been assigned in grammar, convey the meaning of the bases to which they are added. Thus no special meaning having been attached to तुमुन्, it will convey the meaning of the root to which it is added, i. e. it will denote the 'action' of the verb, or Infinitive mood. (1) से—वक्षे रायः । (2) सेन्—तवामेषे स्थानाम् (_Rig_. V. 66. 3). (3 and 4) असे and असेन्—अस्मे शतं शरदों जीवसे धा (_Rig_. III. 36. 10). So also कृत्वे दक्षाय जीवसे (_Rig_. X. 57. 4). With असेन् the word will be जीवसे । (5) क्से—प्रेषे भगाय । (6) कसेन्—गवामिव श्रियसे (_Rig_. V. 59. 3). It has not the नित् accent (VI. 1. 197) which would have given us श्रियसे । (7 and 8) अध्यै, अध्यैन्—कर्मण्युपचारध्यै । (9) कध्यै—इन्द्राग्नी आहुवध्यै (_Rig_. VI. 60. 13). (10) कध्यैन्—श्रियध्यै । (11 and 12) शध्यै, शध्यैन्—पिबध्यै (_Rig_. IV. 27. 5); the accent however is on पि । सह मादयध्यै (_Rig_. VI. 60. 13). (13) तवै—सोममिन्द्राय पातवै । (14) तवेङ्—तं ते गर्भं हवामहे दशमे मासि सूतवे (_Rig_. X. 184. 3). (15) तवेन् = गन्तवे (_Rig_. I. 46. 7); कर्तवे (_Rig_. 1. 85. 9); हर्तवे ॥",
    "34010": "Thus (1) प्रयै देवेभ्यो महीः (_Rig_. I. 142. 6); प्र + या + कै = प्रयै = प्रयातुम् । (2) अपामोषधीनां रोहिष्यै । रुह् + इष्यै =  रोहिष्यै = रोहणाय । (3) अ + व्यथ् + इष्यै = अव्यथिष्यै = अव्यथनाय ।",
    "34011": "Thus दृशे विश्वाय सूर्यम् (_Rig_. I. 50. 1) द्रष्टुम् । विख्ये त्वा हरामि = विख्यातुम् ।",
    "34012": "Of the affix णमुल् the real affix is अम्; the letter ण् causes _vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 115); and ल regulates the accent (VI. I. 193). So also of कमुल्, the letter क् prevents _guna_ and _vriddhi_ substitution (I. I. 5).\n\nThus अग्निं वै देवा विभाजं नाशक्नुवन् 'the Gods were not able to divide _Agni_'. विभज् +णमुल् = विभाजं = विभक्तुम् । So also अपलुपं नाशक्नुवन्, instead of अपलोप्तुम् ।",
    "34013": "Thus ईश्वरोऽभिचरितो = अभिचरितुम् । ईश्वरो विलिखः = विलिखितुम् । ईश्वरो वितृदः = वितर्दितुम् ।",
    "34014": "The force of _kritya_ affixes is to denote 'action' (भाव) and 'object' (कर्मन्). Thus अन्वेतवै = अन्वेतव्यम्; परिधातवै = परिधातव्यम्; नावगाहे = नावगाहितव्यम्; दिदृक्षेण्यः (_Rig_. I. 146. 5) = दिदृक्षितव्यम्; शुश्रूषेण्यः = शुश्रूषितव्यम्; कर्त्वम्; (_Rig_. I. I0. 2) = कर्तव्यम् ।\n \nThe affix तवै was mentioned in _sutra_ (III. 4. 9) also; there it has the force of the Infinitive, and here that of the Passive Participle. For its accent, see (VI. I. 200; 2. 51).",
    "34015": "Thus रिपुणा नावचक्षे (_Rig_. IV. 58. 5)=नावख्यातव्यम् । अव + चक्ष् + एश् = अवचक्षे । The _sutra_ (II. 4. 54) is not applied here.",
    "34016": "These are also Infinitives. The phrase कृत्यार्था is not to be read into this _sutra_. The word भावलक्षण qualifies the sense of the root (भावो लक्ष्यते येन). Thus, स्था--आ संस्थातोर्वेद्यां सीदन्ति = आसमादेः सीदन्ति । इण्--पुरा सूर्यस्योदेतोराधेयः । कृञ्-- पुरा वत्सानामपाकर्तोः । वद्--पुरा प्रवदितोरग्नौ प्रहोतव्यम् । चर्--पुरा प्रचरितोराग्नीध्रीये होतव्याः । (_Gopatha_ _Brahmana_ II. 2. 10)। हु--आ होतोरप्रमत्तस्तिष्ठति । तम्--आ तमितोरासोत (_Taitt_. _Br_. I. 4. 4. 2) । जन्--आ विजनितोः सम्भवाम (_Taitt_. S. II. 5. I. 5).",
    "34017": "Thus विसृपः । पुरा क्रूरस्य विसृपः (_Yaj_. I. 28.); आतृदः (_Rig_. VIII. I. 12); पुरा अत्रुभ्य आतृदः (_Rig_. VIII. I. 12). These words are Indeclinable by (I. I. 40).",
    "34018": "The _anuvritti_ of the words 'in the Vedas &c' does not extend further. Thus अलं कृत्वा 'do not make'; खलु पीत्वा 'do not drink'; अलं काले रुदित्या 'do not weep, O girl !\n\nWhy do we say 'when there are अलं and खलु'? Witness माकार्षीः 'do not make'. Why do we say 'when expressing prohibition'? Observe अलङ्कारः 'decoration'.\n \nThe phrase 'in the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians' shows that it is an optional rule. Therefore we have अलंरोदनेन 'do not weep'. Or if rule (III. 1. 94) be applied, then the use of the word प्राचां is for the sake of merely showing respect (_pujartha_); the rule could have stood without it.",
    "34019": "Thus अपमित्य याचते 'having offered an exchange, he asks' अप + मे + क्त्वा = अप + मा + ल्यप् = अप + मि + तुक् + य (VI. 1. 45) and (VI. 1. 71) = अप + मित्य (VII. 4. 40). This is an optional rule, as the phrase 'according to the northern' indicates. So we have in the alternative, याचित्वाऽपयमते 'having asked he exchanges'; and this is the more general use of _ktva_; namely, it comes after that verb which is concerned about a time anterior to that of the other; see rule 21. The present _sutra_ is an exception to (III. 4. 21).\n\nThe root मेङ् has been exhibited in the _sutra_ as माङ्, with the vowel आ instead of ए. This indicates the existence of the following _Paribhasha_:--\n\n\"A root, which, when destitute of _anubandhas_, ends in either ए, ओ or ऐ, must not be considered to have ceased to end in either ए, ओ, or ऐ, when an _anubandha_ has been attached to it.\" By this _Paribhasha_ दैप् must be regarded as ending in ऐ, and as therefore आ may be substituted for the vowel ऐ (VI. 1. 45), even while प् remains, दैप् does assume the form दाप् and is consequently; by the prohibition अदाप् in _sutra_ (I. 1. 20), forbidden to be termed घु ।",
    "34020": "The situation on the पर 'the other side' and अवर 'this' side, is called परावरयोगः । Thus अप्राप्य नदीम् पर्वतः स्थितः 'the mountain is situate without having reached the river i. e. on this side of the river, the river being on the other side. Here the word पर्वत is qualified by the word नदी which is the point from which the situation is taken; and which in this case, is on the other side of the mountain. Similarly अतिक्रम्य तु पर्वतं नदी स्थिता 'the river is situate on the other side of the mountain'. Here the relation between the 'mountain' and the 'river' is of अवर and पर ।\n\nIn other words:- \"The gerund of a root may be used to imply the situation of a thing with reference to the situation of another spoken of as the agent of the action denoted by that root and of the action denoted by another verb or primitive word used along with the gerund; though the action referred to in the gerund is not prior to the other action\"--G. P.",
    "34021": "Thus भुक्त्वा व्रजति 'having eaten he goes'; पीत्वा व्रजति 'having drunk, he goes'.\n\nThe rule is not confined to the case of two verbs: thus, स्नात्वा, पीत्वा, भुक्त्वा, दत्वा व्रजति 'having bathed, drunk, eaten and given, he goes'.\n\nWhy do we say 'having the same agent'? When the agents are different, the gerund cannot be used, but the Locative Absolute construction will have to be used to express the same sense. Thus भुक्तवति ब्राह्मणो गच्छति देवदत्तः the '_Brahmana_ having been fed, _Devadatta_ goes'.\n\nWhy do we say 'which denotes prior action'? For, if the actions are co-eval, the gerundial construction will not be employed. Thus व्रजति च जल्पति च 'he goes and chatters'.\n\nVart:- The phrase आस्यं व्यादाय स्वपिति, सम्मील्य हसति 'he sleeps, with his mouth open, and laughs with his mouth closed', is valid, though the affix क्त्वा is not added to the verb denoting prior action.",
    "34022": "The phrases 'when the agent of both the verbs is the same' and 'after the verb whose action occurs first in time' are to be read into this _sutra_ to complete the sense. The force of च is to introduce the affix क्त्वा into this _sutra_. The affixes _ktva_ and _namul_ express 're-iteration' then only when the verb is doubled, and not singly. See rule (VIII. I. 4). Thus भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'having eaten repeatedly, he goes'; similarly भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति, पायं पायं व्रजति 'having drunk repeatedly he goes'.",
    "34023": "The word आकाङ्क्षा means 'inter-dependence' or the inability of a word, phrase or sentence, to indicate the intended sense in the absence of another word, phrase, or sentence. In other words, when there are two actions one prior and another subsequent, and they complete the sense of the sentence, without standing in need of any other verb; in such a case, _ktva_ and _namul_ are not used, when the word _yad_ is in composition. This _sutra_ prohibits the affix _ktva_ also, though the affix _namul_ is in immediate context. Thus यदयं भुङ्क्ते ततः पचति, यदयमधीते ततः शेते, 'having eaten, he cooks ; having read, he sleeps'.\n\nBut when there is inter-dependence or आकाङ्क्षा, we have यदयं भुक्त्वा व्रजति, अधीत एव ततः परम् । Professor Bohtlingk translates it thus : \"In connection with यद् the above-mentioned Absolutives will not be applied, unless the two verbs required one more as complement.\"",
    "34024": "This is an _Aprapta_-_vibhasha_. The word 're-iteration' is not understood here. Thus अग्रे, प्रथमं, पूर्वं वा भोजं भुक्त्वा व्रजति  'having first eaten he goes'.\n\nBy using the word 'optionally' it is indicated, that the regular Tenses, such as the Present &c, may be employed also. Thus अग्रे भुङ्क्ते ततः व्रजति 'he eats first and then goes'.\n\nQ-- The affixes of _Lat_ (Present tense) &c. would have been applied by the rule of वाऽसरूप (III. 1. 94); why then use the word 'optionally'?\nAns.-- The very use of the word 'optionally' in this _sutra_ indicates the existence of this _Paribhasha_ :- \"The rule (III. I. 94) has no concern with the affixes _ktva_ and _namul_, when both these affixes are enjoined at one and the same time by a single rule.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot apply (III. 1. 94) and use the affixes _Lat_ &c, when 're-iteration' is meant That is the exclusive province of क्त्वा and णमुल् ।\n\nWhy is not here the _Upapada_ compounding by rule (II. 2. 20)? For an answer to this, see the commentary on (II. 2. 20). Had only णमुल् been enjoined by this _sutra_, and not क्त्वा also, then we could have formed the उपपद समास, for such is the force of the word एव in that _sutra_.",
    "34025": "Of the affix  खमुञ्, the efficient portion is अम्; the indicatory ख introduces the augment मुम् (VI. 3. 67). Thus चोरं कारमाक्रोशति 'he reviles him as thief, i. e. he calls out in abuse 'thou art a thief., thou art a robber, &c.' The person is not really made a thief, but making him a thief is to express one's indignation.",
    "34026": "The words within brackets are to be read into the _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from (III. 4. 21). Thus स्वादुङ्कारं or लक्षणङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having made his food sweet or seasoned'.\n\nIn the _sutra_, the word स्वादुम् is used ending with म्. It is an anomalous form, and indicates that a म् must be added to the _upapadas_ in these cases the object served by this form being that rule (IV. 1. 44), by which feminine of words like स्वादु ending in उ is formed by long ई, does not apply here. Thus स्वाद्वीम् कृत्वा यवागूम् भुङ्क्ते = स्वादुङ्कारं यवागूम् भुङ्क्ते । Here though यवागू is feminine, the attribute is still स्वादुं and not स्वाद्वीं ।\n\nIt might be said 'why not use the previous affix खमुञ्? That will solve all difficulties; and will give us the augment मुम् । To this, however, there is a fatal objection. The augment मुम् will, no doubt, come in the last example, but it will not come when the word to be formed is an Indeclinable (VI. 3. 67), such as, when the sense is of the affix च्वि and all _chvi_-ending words are Indeclinables (I. 4. 61). Therefore, the affix खमुञ् will not remove the difficulty in the following case; अस्वाद्वीं स्वाद्वों कृत्वा भुङ्क्ते = स्वादुङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having first sweetened what was not sweet before'.\n\nBy applying rule (III. 1. 94), we have the affix क्त्वा in the alternative. Thus स्वादु कृत्वा भुङ्क्तं । All these affixes form abstract nouns (भाव) as they have the sense of the affix तुमुन् (III. 4. 16). In connection with णमुल्, the Instrumental case can not, however, be used, i. e. we cannot use the Passive construction; e.g. स्वादुङ्कारं यवागूर्भुज्यते देवदत्तेन will be wrong.",
    "34027": "When is the non-employment of कृञ् valid ? When the same sentence will remain correct by omitting कृ, i. e. when without employing it, the same idea will be expressed. Thus अन्यथाकारं, एवङ्कारं, कथङ्कारं or इत्थङ्कारं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats otherwise, he eats so, how does he eat, or he eats thus'. In fact, the sentence अन्यथाकारं भुङ्क्ते is equivalent to अन्यथा भुङ्क्ते ।\n\nWhy do we say 'if the non-employment would be valid'? Witness अन्यथा कृत्वा शिरो भुङ्क्ते 'he eats, having turned his head aside'. Here कृञ् could not be spared.",
    "34028": "When one questions or replies in indignation, displeasure or anger, then is this construction valid. Thus तथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन 'l will eat in that way; what is that to you'? Similarly यथाकारं भोक्ष्ये, किं तवानेन ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when an angry reply is made'? Observe यथाकृत्वाऽहं भोक्ष्ये तथा त्वं द्रक्ष्यसि 'in what way I will eat, that thou wilt see'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the omission of कृञ् would be valid'? Witness यथाकृत्वाऽहं शिरो भोक्ष्ये किं तवानेन 'what is that to you, in what way turning my head I will eat'?",
    "34029": "Thus कन्यादर्शं वरयति 'he woos every girl that he sees i.e. all the girls seen'. ब्राह्मणवेदं भोजयति 'he feeds as many _Brahmanas_ as he knows, i.e. all'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting the total number of such objects'? Observe ब्राह्मणं दृष्ट्वा भोजयति 'having seen the _Brahmana_ he feeds him'.",
    "34030": "As यावद्वेदं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats all that he gets'. यावज्जीवमधीते 'he studies as long as he lives, i.e. throughout his life'.",
    "34031": "Thus उदरपूरं भुङ्क्ते 'he eats so as to fill his belly'? चर्मपूरं स्तृणाति 'he spreads so as to cover the skin'.",
    "34032": "Thus गोष्पदपूरं or गोष्पदप्रं वृष्टो देवः 'it rained filling up small puddles (lit. the impression made by the foot of the cow on the soil)'. सीतापूरं or सीताप्रं वृष्टो देवः 'it rained filling up all furrows'.\n\nWhy have we used the word अस्य 'of this _pur_' in the _sutra_ ? The long ऊ of पूर् is to be elided, and not the long ऊ, if there be any, of the _upapada_. Thus मूषिकाबिलपूरं or मूषिकाबिलप्रं वृष्टो देवः । Here the long ऊ of मू is not shortened.",
    "34033": "The verb क्नोपि is the causative root formed from the simple root क्नूय् 'to wet'. Thus चेलक्नोपं वृष्टो देवः or वस्त्रक्नोपं or वसनक्नोपं &c. 'it rained so as to wet the clothes'.",
    "34034": "Thus निमूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes down to the roots'; समूलकाषं कषति 'he scrapes up to the roots'. In fact, the gerund of the root and the root itself denote the same thing; the whole sentence निमूलकाषङ्कषति being equal to निमूलं कषति. From this _sutra_ up to _sutra_ (III. 4. 46), the subsequent verb governing the previous word, must be derived from the same root from which the gerund is derived; see _sutra_ (III. 4. 46).",
    "34035": "Thus शुष्कपेषं पिनष्टि = शुष्कं पिनष्टि 'he grinds it dry'; चूर्णपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds to powder'; रूक्षपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds it dry'. Here also an appropriate verb from the same root पिष् must be used to govern the gerund.",
    "34036": "Thus समूलघातं हन्ति (VIII. 3. 32) and (VIII. 3. 54) 'he destroys so as to tear up by the roots i.e. he totally extirpates'; अकृतकारं करोति 'he does a thing which was not done before'; तं जीवग्राहं गृह्णाति 'captures him so as to preserve his life, i. e. captures him alive'. Here also appropriate verbs from the same roots are used to govern the gerund.",
    "34037": "Thus पाणिघातं वेदिं हन्ति (VII. 3. 32) and (VII. 3. 54) = पाणिना वेदिं हन्ति 'the strikes the _Vedi_ with the hand'; पादघातं भूमिं हन्ति 'he strikes the ground with the foot'. Reading this _sutra_ along with (III. 4. 48), we find that हन् here does not mean 'to kill', and the further difference between this aphorism and that is, that in the case of this _sutra_ a cognate verb from the same root must be used, as the gerund; not so in _sutra_ (III. 4. 48); or this _sutra_ may be for the sake of forming Invariable compounds with the _upapadas_, such as पादघातं ।\n\nAccording to _Patanjali_, this affix comes after हन् under this aphorism, even when हन् means 'to injure'; thus counteracting rule (III. 4. 48), by anticipation, and in opposition to the general principle of interpretation enunciated in rule (I. 4. 2). Thus असिघातं हन्ति 'he kills with the sword'; शरघातं हन्ति 'he kills with arrows'.\n\nRule (III. 4. 46) applies here also, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.",
    "34038": "Thus उदपेषं पिनष्टि = उदकेन पिनष्ठि (VI. 3. 58.) 'he grinds with water'; तैलपेषं पिनष्टि 'he grinds with oil'. Here also (III. 4. 46) applies, and an appropriate verb from the same root is employed to govern the gerund.",
    "34039": "Thus हस्तवर्ते, करवर्ते or पाणिवर्ते वर्तयति = हस्तेन वर्तयति 'he revolves by the hand'. So also, तम् हस्तग्राहम् गृह्णाति 'he takes him by the hand': so पाणिग्राहम्, करग्राहम् &c.\n\nHere also rule (III. 4. 46) applies and appropriate verbs from the same roots must be employed to govern the gerund.",
    "34040": "The word स्व means 'self', 'kinsmen' and 'property'. Thus स्वपोषं पुष्णाति 'he feeds himself'; आत्मपोषं, गोपोषं, पितृपोषं, मातृपोषं, धनपोषं, रैपोषं &c. See (I. 1. 68). Rule 46 applies here also.",
    "34041": "Of course, rule (III. 4. 46) applies here also, and the gerund must be governed by a verb from the same root _bandh_. Thus चक्रबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds to the wheel'; कूटबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in a snare'; मुष्टिबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in the fist'. चोरकबन्धं बध्नाति = चोरके बध्नाति ।",
    "34042": "Thus क्रौञ्चबन्धं बध्नाति 'he binds in the manner called _krauncha_-_bandhan_ or 'heron-knot'. मयूरिकाबन्धं बध्नाति or बद्धः 'he binds or is bound in a 'peacock-knot'. अट्टालिकाबन्धं बद्धः 'bound in a knot called _attalika_-_bandhan_'.\n\nAll the above, _krauncha_-_bandhan_ &c. are names of various sorts of 'bonds or knots'. The rule (III. 4. 46.) also applies here.",
    "34043": "Thus जीवनाशं नश्यति = जीवो नश्यति 'perishes, so that his life perishes i.e. dies away'; पुरुषवाहं वहति 'the man carries, i.e. the man becoming a servant, carries another on him = पुरुषः प्रेष्यो भूत्वा वहन्ति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an agent'? Observe, जीवेन नष्टः 'destroyed by life'; पुरुषेणोढः 'carried by a man'.",
    "34044": "Thus ऊर्ध्वशोषं शुष्यति वृक्षः = ऊर्ध्वे शुष्यति 'the tree is dried up while it is still standing'. Compare यद्वोर्ध्वशोषतृणवद्विशुष्कः 'or wither like the up-heaved grass drying up' (_Bhatti_. III. 14); ऊर्ध्वपूरं पूर्यते 'is filled full to the brim'. Rule (III. 4. 46) applies here also.",
    "34045": "The word 'agent' is read into the _sutra_, by virtue of the word च 'also'. That with which any thing is compared is called उपमान or 'object of comparison or similitude'. As घृतनिधायम् निहितम् जलम् 'water was kept as ghee would be kept'. सुवर्णनिधायम् निहितः 'was kept as gold'. The force is that of इव; thus घृतनिधायम् निहितः = घृतमिव निहितः । So also when the object of comparison is as agent: thus, अजनाशे नष्टः 'he perished like a goat'. So also चूडकनाशम् दन्तनाशम्, &c.",
    "34046": "From _sutra_ (III. 4. 34) up to _sutra_ (III. 4. 45), a verb from the same root must be employed in the subsequent part, as _anuprayoga_, from which the gerund in _namul_ was formed. This rule has been illustrated in the examples under the previous aphorisms.\n\nThe present is a restrictive or _niyama_ rule. This chapter deals with affixes employed in denoting syntactical relation between two verbs (धातुसम्बन्धे प्रत्ययाः)। See (III. 4. 1) : so a gerund in _namul_, would, of course, be followed by some verb as _anuprayoga_; the present _sutra_ declares that the other verb must be from the same root as the gerund.",
    "34047": "The _Upapada_ _samasa_ is optional in this case (II. 2. 21). Thus मूलकोपदं शम् भुङ्क्ते or मूलकेनोपदंशम् भुङ्क्ते 'he eats after having relished the food with radish'. Similarly आर्द्रकोपदंशम् भुङ्क्ते or आर्द्रकेणोपदंशम् 'relished with ginger'.\n\nThe words मूलक &c in the above examples are the 'objects' of the verb उपदंश्, and 'instruments' of the verb भुज् ।\n\nBy the rule of वाऽसरूप (III. I. 94) the affix क्त्वा (or its substitute ल्यप्) may be optionally used, wherever we may use the affix णमुल् । Thus मूलकेनोपदश्य भुङ्क्ते ।",
    "34048": "Thus दण्डोपघातम् गाः कालयति 'he collects together cows, beating them with a club'. The compounding is optional (II. 2. 21). Thus we have also दण्डेनोपघातम् । Similarly with other verbs having the sense of हिंस; thus, दण्डताडम् or दण्डेन ताडम् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the object of the gerund is the same as the object of the main verb'? When the objects are different, णमुल् will not be employed. Thus चोरम् दण्डेनोपहत्य, गोपालको गाः कालयति 'having beaten the thief with the club, the cowherd collects together the cows'.",
    "34049": "The phrase '3rd case-affix' must be read into the _sutra_ by virtue of the word च । Thus पार्श्वोपपीडं शेते 'he sleeps pressing on his sides'. The compounding is optional (II. 2. 21); so we have in the alternative, पार्श्वयोरुपपीडम् or पार्श्वाभ्यामुपपीडम् ।\n\nSo also व्रजोपरोधम् (or व्रजे उपरोधम् or व्रजेनोपरोधम्) गाः स्थापयति 'he stations the cows so that they are all in the fold'. पाण्युपकर्षं (or पाणावुपकर्षम् or पाणिनोपकर्षम्) धानाः सङ्गृह्णाति । It is _Bhvadi_ कृष् here, and not _Tudadi_.",
    "34050": "The word समासत्तिः means 'immediate contiguity'. Thus केशग्राहम् (or केशेषु ग्राहम् or केशैर्ग्राहम्) युध्यन्ते 'having closely caught each other by the hair, they fight.' Similarly हस्तग्राहम् or हस्तेषु ग्राहम् or हस्तैर्ग्राहम्; so also यष्टिग्राहम् 'taking a stick'; लोष्ट्रग्राहं &c. See (II. 2. 21).",
    "34051": "The word प्रमाणं means 'length or extension'. Thus द्वयङ्गुलोत्कर्षं ( द्वयङ्गुले उत्कर्षम् or द्वयङ्गुलेनोत्कर्षम्) खण्डिकां छिनत्ति 'he cuts pieces of the length of two fingers'. See (II. 2. 21).",
    "34052": "The word परीप्सा means 'haste, hurry'. Thus शय्योत्थायं (or शय्याया उत्थायं) धावति 'having risen from bed, he runs away'. That is to say, he runs with such a haste that he does not perform even the necessary ablutions &c, but as soon as he rises from the bed, he runs off. Similarly रन्ध्रापकर्षम् पयः पिबति 'he drinks milk from a hole in the vessel', he being in such a haste, that he does not care to drink from the proper aperture. भ्राष्ट्रापकर्षमपूपान् भक्षयति 'he eats cakes hot from the frying pan', not waiting till they are placed on a dish.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning hurry'? Observe, आसनादुत्थाय गच्छति 'having risen from the seat, he goes'. Here 'haste' not being intended, the affix क्त्वा (ल्यप्) is employed. See (II. 2. 21).",
    "34053": "Thus यष्टिग्राहम् (or यष्टिं ग्राहम्) युध्यन्ते 'they fight, having hastily taken up sticks'. That is, they are in such a haste to fight, that they do not tarry to take up the proper weapons, offensive and defensive, but engage in fight with anything that is at hand, such as sticks, stones &c. Similarly लोष्ट्रग्राहम् or लोष्ट्रं ग्राहम् ।",
    "34054": "Thus ध्रुविक्षेपं कथयति 'he narrates, throwing his eye-brows (glances) about in all directions'. अक्षिनिकाणम् जल्पति 'he prattles, having closed the eyes'.\n\nThe स्वाङ्ग word is \"a word denoting a thing which not being liquid or gaseous, and being capable of being perceived by the senses, and not being one produced by a change from the natural state, exists in a living being, or though found elsewhere actually or at any particular time, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually, (not figuratively) the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.\"\n\nThe word अध्रुव means 'non-vital organ', or a limb which even being cut off, does not necessarily destroy life. Therefore, we cannot use the affix णमुल् in the following, as head is not an अध्रुव limb:- उत्क्षिप्य शिरः कथयति 'he narrates, having thrown the head on one side'. Compare (VI. 2. 177).",
    "34055": "The word परिक्लिश्यमान means 'completely hurt or affected'. Thus उरः प्रतिपेषं or उरःपेषं युध्यन्ते = कृत्स्नमुरः पीडयन्तः 'they fight so as to afflict their whole bosom'. So also शिरःपेषं or शिरःप्रतिपेषं ।\n\nThe difference between this and the last _sutra_ consists in this, that this _sutra_ applies even to vital organs, such as 'breast', 'head' &c; while the last aphorism applies 'non-vital organs' only.",
    "34056": "The word व्याप्ति (or व्याप्यमान) means the full and complete pervasion of the substances with the actions (denoted by the verbs विश्, &c). The word आसेवा means 'assiduous performance of any action, or absorption into it'. In other words, 'frequency' of an action is आसेवा । The word व्याप्ति therefore refers to the noun (in the accusative case) and आसेवा to the verb (such as _vis_ &c). These two words have the same significance here as the words नित्य and वीप्सा in _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 4.) and by the application of that rule, both the noun and the verb require to be repeated. That rule, however, will not apply here, when there is compounding by (II. 2. 21). But when there is no compounding, (for rule (II. 2. 21.) makes composition only optional) then there is repetition of the noun if व्याप्ति 'all' is meant; and of the verb, if आसेवा 'frequency or assiduous performance' is meant. Thus गेहानुप्रवेशमास्ते, (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रवेशमास्ते or गेहमनुप्रवेशमनुप्रवेशमास्ते) 'having entered the house, he sits down', meaning either, 'having entered every house in succession, he sits down', or 'having repeatedly entered the house, he sits down'.\n\nSimilarly with the root पत्, we may have three examples as in the last, and so also with the roots पद् and स्कन्द् । Thus गेहानुप्रपातमास्ते (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रपातमास्ते or गेहमनुप्रपातमनुप्रपातमास्ते); गेहानुप्रपादमास्ते (or गेहङ्गेहमनुप्रपादं or गेहमनुप्रपादमनुप्रपादम्); गेहावस्कन्दमास्ते (or गेहगेहमवस्कन्दं or गेहमवस्कन्दमवस्कन्दम्) ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the sense is that of all or frequency'? Observe, गेहमनुप्रविश्य भुङ्क्ते 'having entered the house, he eats'.\n\nQ.- By _sutra_ (III. 4. 22), _namul_ would have been valid, when _abhikshna_ was meant; and _abhikshna_ and _aseva_ mean the same thing i. e, 'frequency'. Why then ordain _namul_ again, by the present _sutra_, in the sense of _aseva_ ? If you say, \"we repeat it, in order to prevent the coming of the affix क्त्वा\", that is not so. For क्त्वा would come by वाऽसरूप rule; (see (III. 1. 94) and (III. 4. 47)).\n\nA.- The repetition is for the sake of _Upapada_-_samasa_ with a word in the accusative case. Under rule 22, there was no _upapada_, while in the present case there is an _upapada_.\n\nProfessor Bohtlingk translates this _sutra_ thus:- \"विश्, पत्, पद्, and स्कन्द् in composition with an accusative, form the absolutive gerund in अम् (_namul_), when one wishes to express that every object of that name is completely affected by the action, or that the action is constantly repeated in that object.\"",
    "34057": "The word क्रियान्तर means 'the interval between two actions'. Thus द्व्यहात्यासं or द्व्यहमत्यासम्म् गाः पाययति 'he gives drink to the cows, after an interval of two days, i. e every third day'. So also द्व्यहतर्षं or द्व्यहं तर्षं गाः पाययति 'having kept the cows thirsty for two days, he makes them drink'. That is to say, 'having given them a drink today, he gives them another drink after an interval of two days'; &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'after the verbs अस् and तृष्'? Because the affix णमुल् will not be applied after other roots, though the sense be that of interval of time. Thus द्व्यहमुपोष्य भुङ्क्ते 'having fasted for two days, he eats'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when denoting an intermission of action'? Observe अहरत्यस्येषून् गतः; here there is no intermission in the action of 'going'.\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting time' ? Observe योजनमत्यस्य गाः पाययति 'allowing an interval of four miles to pass, he gives drink to the cows i. e. he waters the cows at every four miles'. Here the interval is that of 'space' and not of 'time', and hence the affix is ल्यप् and not णमुल् ।",
    "34058": "Thus नामादेशमाचष्ठे 'he mentions it, telling his name'. नामग्राहं मामाहूयति 'he calls me by taking my name (i.e. by my name)'.",
    "34059": "The word अयथाभिप्रेताख्यान means literally 'to denote the expression of that which is not really intended' i.e. a manner not suited to the proper communication of that news, such as communicating a bad news in a loud voice and good news in a low voice. The compounding being optional, the affix क्त्वा may be replaced by ल्यप्. Thus we have three forms नीचैःकृत्य, नीचैःकृत्वा, or नीचैःकार. Thus if one had communicated an agreeable news like the birth of a son in a low voice, the other may retort \"किं तर्हि वृषल नीचैःकृत्वा, नीचैःकृत्य, or नीचैःकारमाचक्षे\"; and so, if one had communicated an unpleasant news as ब्राह्मण कण्याते गर्भिणी in a loud voice, the other may reply \"किं तर्हि वृषलोच्चैःकृत्वा, उच्चैःकृत्य, or उच्चैःकारमाचक्षे । (See (II. 2. 22) for compounding).\n\nWhy do we say 'communicating in an undesired manner'? Observe उच्चैःकृत्वाऽऽचक्षे पुत्रस्ते जातः । Here only क्त्वा is added. Why have we repeated क्त्वा in this _sutra_, when in this chapter, by the rule of वाऽसरूप (III. 1. 94), _ktva_ would have presented itself in the alternative? The repetition is for the sake of _samasa_ or composition, by the application of (II. 2. 22). The repetition of णमुल् is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_, into which the _anuvritti_ of _ktva_ and _namul_ runs concurrently.",
    "34060": "The word अपवर्ग means 'completing or finishing'. Thus तिर्यक् कृत्य, तिर्यक् कृत्वा or तिर्यक्कारं गतः - समाप्य गतः 'having completed, he went away'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning completion'? Observe तिर्यक् कृत्वा काष्ठं गतः 'having placed the wood obliquely, he went away'. Here णमुल् is not employed. See (II. 2. 22) for compounding. The word तिर्यचि is the locative of the word-form तिर्यच्, and not of the word तिर्यच् । Other examples are: एतदोश् (V. 3. 5); अदसो मात् (I. I. 12).",
    "34061": "The word स्वाङ्ग has already been defined in _sutra_ (III. 4. 54). The _svanga_ word in the present case must be such as should end in the affix तस् - a _taddhita_ affix technically called तसि and तसिल् (V. 3. 78) &c)). Though here there are two roots कृ and भू, and there are two affixes to be applied i. e. क्त्वा and णमुल्; yet the rule of 'respective allocation' (I. 3. 10) does not apply here. Both the affixes are applied to each of the roots. Thus मुखतः कृत्य गतः or मुखतः कृत्वा गतः or मुखतः कारङ्गतः । Similarly पृष्टतःभूय तिष्ठति or पृष्टतः भूत्वा तिष्ठति or पृष्टतः भावं तिष्ठति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'a word denoting a limb of one's own body'? Observe सर्वतः कृत्वा गतः ।\n\nWhy do we say 'ending in the affix तस्'? Observe मुखीकृत्य गतः, मुखीभूय गतः ।\n\nWhy do we use the word 'the affix'? If तस् is not an affix, but a verb, the rule will not apply. Thus मुखे तस्यति = मुखतः 'throws in the mouth'. With this मुखतः so formed, we cannot apply the rule. Thus मुखतः कृत्वा गतः ।",
    "34062": "Two words, नाना 'various' and विना 'without' are formed by the affix ना (V. 2. 27); affixes having the force of धा are धा, ध्यम्, धम् and एधा (V. 3. 42) to (V. 3. 46) which are added to numerals in the sense of 'part' or 'fold' &c. The force of _chvi_ has already been explained.\n\nThus अनाना नाना कृत्वा गतः = नाना कृत्य गतः Similarly नाना कृत्वा or नानाकारं गतः । So also विना कृत्य, विना कृत्वा or विना कारं गतः । So also नाना or विना भूय-भूत्वा or भावं गतः । With words formed by धा and cognate affixes, we have:- द्विधा or द्वैधं कृत्य—कृत्वा—कारं—भूय—भूत्वा or भावं गतः । But not so in हिरुक् कृत्वा, पृथक् कृत्वा ।\n\nWhy do we use the word 'affix (प्रत्यय)' in the _sutra_? Without it, the _sutra_ would have run thus: नाधार्थे च्व्यर्थे, and then any word, having the sense of ना, which has the force of 'except', 'various' or the sense of धा which means 'part or fold', when in composition with कृ or भू, would have taken the affix णमुल् and क्त्वा. But that is not so. Thus the words हिरुक् 'except' and पृथक् 'separately' have the sense of ना and धा respectively; as हिरुक्कृत्वा, or पृथक् कृत्वा ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the _upapada_ has the force of the affix _chvi_'? Observe नाना कृत्वा काष्ठानि गतः ।\n\nThe word अर्थ in नाधार्थ qualifies only the term धा, and not ना, for there are no other affix having the sense of ना, which is a single affix taught in (V. 2. 27); while, as shown above, there are other affixes having the force of धा । The composition optionally takes place by (II. 2. 22).",
    "34063": "Thus तूष्णीम्भूय, तूष्णीं भूत्वा, or तूष्णीम्भावम् 'having become silent'. The repetition of भू in this _sutra_, shows that the _anuvritti_ of कृ does not run into it and altogether ceases.",
    "34064": "The word आनुलोम्य means 'agreeable, friendly or favourably disposed, or doing according to the wish of another'. Thus अन्वग्भूय—अन्वग्भूत्वा or अन्वग् भावमास्ते 'he is favourably disposed'.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning friendly' ? Observe अन्वग्भूत्वा तिष्ठति 'he remains behind'.",
    "34065": "The use of the Infinitive in तुमुन् formed by this rule, differs from that given in _sutra_ (III. 3. 10). In that _sutra_ the Infinitive had the force of 'purpose' and here there is no such force. Moreover in this case there is an _upapada_ in construction, though that _upapada_ is a verb; in rule (III. 3. 10), there was no such _upapada_.\n\nThus शक्नोमि भोक्तुम् 'I am able to eat'. Similarly जानाति—ग्लायति—घटते—आरभते—लभते—प्रक्रमते—सहते—अर्हति—अस्ति—भवति—or विद्यते भोक्तुम् 'he knows', he is wearied, he strives, he begins, he gets, he proceeds, he bears, he condescends or he is, to eat'.\n\nThis _sutra_ presents a knotty point. _Bhattoji_ _Dikshita_ says अर्थग्रहणमस्तिनैव सम्बध्यते अनन्तरत्वात् i.e. the _sutra_ gives roots from शक् to अर्ह and roots having the same sense as अस् 'to be'. But this is hardly consistent with the almost overwhelming evidence of usage. According to _Dikshita_'s interpretation, पारय 'to be able' cannot be used with the Infinitive, but न पारयामि निवेदयितुम् (S. 4), पारयिष्यस्यत्रभवत्यअपरान्दधुम् (M. 3.) are instances from a standard author; similarly विद् 'to know' cannot be used with the Infinitive; but न च वेद सम्यग् द्रष्टुम् न सा (R. VI. 30) is as good an instance. We must, therefore, suppose that the _sutra_ indicates the existence of an interpretation connecting अर्थ with all the preceding roots; otherwise we shall have to condemn as wrong, all such constructions as those given above. Taking this view I have interpreted the _sutra_, connecting अर्थ with all the above roots.- _Apte_'s Composition.",
    "34066": "The word पर्याप्ति means 'capability, ability, fulness'. Thus लिखितमपि ललाटे प्रोज्झितुम् कः समर्थः (_Hitopadesa_) 'who is able to avoid that which is stamped on his forehead'. लोकान् अलं दग्धुम् हि तत्तपः (_Kumara_ II. 56) 'his penance is able to burn the worlds'. अस्ति मे विभवः सर्वं परिज्ञातुं (_Vikramorvasi_ 2) 'I have power to know every thing'. भोक्तुम् प्रवीणः कुशलः पटुर्वा 'skilful in eating'.\n\nAnother interpretation of the _sutra_ is \"the affix _tumun_ is added to a verb, when it has in composition with it, the word पर्याप्ति or अलम् or a synonym of _alam_ having the sense of _paryapti_. Thus पर्याप्तो भोक्तुम्, अलं भोक्तुम्, भोक्तुम् पारयति ।\n\nWhy do we say 'having the sense of capability'? Observe अलम्कृत्वा ।\n\nWhy do we say 'having the meaning of अलम्'? Observe पर्याप्तुम् भुङ्क्ते । The word शक् in the preceding _sutra_ has not the sense of अलम् in that aphorism. With the sense of अलम्, the present _sutra_ will apply: as शक्यमेवं कर्तुम् ।",
    "34067": "The words formed by _krit_ affixes have the sense of agency; when no other special sense has been assigned to them by any rule, then this rule will apply, and fix the force of the affix. This rule will not, therefore, apply to _krit_ affixes like ख्युन् (III. 2. 5) and (III. 2. 6) to which a special sense has been assigned, but affixes like ण्वुल् and तृच् &c, (III. 1. 133). Thus कारकः means a 'doer'; कर्त्ता 'an agent'; नन्दनः 'one who causes happiness'; ग्राही 'who seizes'; पचः 'who cooks'.",
    "34068": "These words are formed by _kritya_ affixes and therefore by rule (III. 4. 70), they would generally denote an action in the abstract, and the object, but not the agent. The present _sutra_, however, makes them denote optionally the agent also. In the alternative they denote the action-name and the object also. Thus भव्य may mean 'existed', 'existence', or 'one who exists'; गेय means 'a singer', 'a song', or 'singing'; प्रवचनीय means 'one who explains', 'what ought to be explained', or 'an explanation'; उपस्थानीय means 'who waits upon', 'what ought to be waited upon or served', or 'waiting upon or attendance'; जन्य = जायतेऽसौ or जन्यमनेन means 'one who gives birth i. e. a father', 'birth' or 'what is born'; आप्लाव्य = आप्लवतेऽसौ or आप्लाव्यमनेन means 'who immerses', one 'immersing', or 'what ought to be immersed'; आपात्य = आपतत्यसौ or आपात्यमनेन means 'what falls upon', 'falling upon', or 'what ought to fall upon'. Thus गेयो माणवकः साम्नां 'the boy is the singer of the _Sama_'; or गेयानि माणवकेन सामानि 'the boy ought to sing the _Sama_'; प्रवचनीयो गुरुः स्वाध्यायस्य 'the _guru_ is the expounder of the lesson'; प्रवचनीयो गुरुणा स्वाध्यायः 'the lesson ought to be explained by the teacher'; उपस्थानीयोऽन्तेवासी गुरोः 'the pupil is the servant of the teacher'; उपस्थानीयः शिष्येण गुरुः 'the teacher ought to be served by the pupil'.",
    "34069": "The term ल् means the ten affixes known as लट्, लिट्, &c; ल् is the common element of them all; and these affixes, when stripped of all indicatory letters, leave behind only the letter ल् which is thus common name for them all. The लः in the _sutra_, is the nominative plural of ल् । By the word च in the _sutra_, we draw in the word कर्ता or 'agent' from the last _sutra_ into this. The force of these tense-affixes, when placed after transitive verbs is to denote the object and the agent; and when placed after intransitive verbs, is to denote either 'action' (भाव) or it may denote the 'agent'.\n\nThe verb itself denotes the action; to be or to do, generally; or to be or to do, in a particular manner. In the active voice the affix marks the agent; in the passive voice of a transitive verb, it marks the object; but in the passive form of an intransitive verb, the action itself. Thus, गम्यते ग्रामो देवदत्तेन 'the village is gone to by _Devadatta_'; here ते of गम्यते denotes the object and is in passive construction. गच्छति ग्रामं देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ goes to the village'; here the affix ति of गच्छति denotes the agent, and the sentence is in active construction. The verb गम् being a transitive verb, can take both the active and passive constructions or, to use the Sanskrit technical phraseology, the tense affixes, after transitive verbs, denote the agent and the object. They can never denote भाव or action after transitive verbs, that is, transitive verbs cannot be used impersonally. Let us now give examples of Intransitive verbs; आस्यते देवदत्तेन 'it is seated by _Devadatta_'; the verb आस्यते here denotes merely भाव or 'action'. In other words, we may call this an impersonal construction. आस्ते देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ sits'; here the verb आस्ते denotes the agent or is in the active voice.\n\nProfessor Bohtlingk translates the _sutra_ thus:- \"A finite verb expresses the agent as well as the object; but the Intransitive verbs denote, in addition to that, the Impersonal idea of the action\". The word भाव means action considered in the abstract.",
    "34070": "The word तयोः 'of those two' refers to भाव 'an Impersonal act', and कर्म, 'object'. The word एव 'only' is used in the _sutra_ to exclude the word 'agent' from it. Thus कर्तव्यः कटो भवता 'the mat must be made by you'; भोक्तव्यः ओदनो भवता 'the rice must be eaten by you'. Here the affix तव्य has the force of denoting the object; we may, therefore, call it the Potential Passive Participle affix. So also आशितव्यं भवता 'thou must eat'; शयितव्यं भवता 'thou must lie down'. Here the sense of the affix तव्य being that of the action itself, which being Impersonal, is in the singular number, as it is one only, and neither male nor female, there is, from the nature of the case, a singular affix, and the neuter gender is employed.\n\nSimilarly the affix क्त denotes both the object and the action; कृतः कटो भवता 'the mat is made by you'; भुक्त ओदनो भवता 'the rice is eaten by you'. Here त is used with the force of denoting the object and may be called the past passive participle.\n\nSimilarly त may be used in denoting the mere act; आसितं भवता 'you sat'; शयितं भवता 'you lay down'.\n\nSimilarly the affixes having the sense of खल् (III. 3. 126) denote both the object and the Impersonal act. In the following examples the affixes denote the object; ईषत्करः कटो भवता 'this mat is made, by little at a time, by you'; सुकरः 'what is made with ease'; दुष्करः 'what is made with difficulty'. In the following examples the affixes denote the act; ईषदाढ्यम्भवं भवता and स्वाढ्यम्भवं भवता ।\n\nAfter transitive verbs, the _kritya_, the _kta_ and the _khalartha_ affixes only denote the object, but never denote the भाव or 'an Impersonal action'.",
    "34071": "The word आदिकर्मणि means 'the beginning of an action' or when the action signified by the roots, is intended to be expressed merely as having been simply begun. The force of च in the _sutra_ is to indicate that even when the beginning of an action is intended to be expressed, the क्त may be used to denote the act and the object as well. Thus प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः here the agent is denoted. प्रकृतः कटो देवदत्तेन; here the object is denoted. प्रकृतम् देवदत्तेन; here mere action is denoted. Similarly प्रभुक्त ओदनं देवदत्तः (agent); प्रभुक्त ओदनो देवदत्तेन (object); प्रभुक्तं देवदत्तेन (act).",
    "34072": "The phrase 'the act and the object' has been added into the _sutra_ by virtue of the word च. Thus गतो देवदत्तो ग्रामम्  '_Devadatta_ is gone to the village' (agent); देवदत्तेन ग्रामः गतः 'the village was gone to by _Devadatta_ (object); गतं देवदत्तेन '_Devadatta_ went' (act). The past participle forms from Intransitive verbs, denote the agent and the act only; or in other words, they are used impersonally and in the Active voice, but never in the Passive voice or denoting the object. Thus ग्लानो भवान् 'you were wearied' (agent), ग्लानं भवता (object); आसितो भवान् 'you sat' (agent), आसितं भवता (object); उपश्लिष्टो गुरुम् भवान् 'you embraced the teacher' (agent), उपश्लिष्टो गुरुः भवता 'the _guru_ was embraced by you' (object), उपश्लिष्टम् भवता 'you embraced' (act); उपशयितो गुरुम् भवान् 'you lay near the _guru_' (agent), उपशयितो गुरुः भवता (object), उपशयितं भवता (act); उपस्थितो गुरुम् भवान् (agent), उपस्थितो गुरुः भवता (object), उपस्थितं भवता (act); उपासितो गुरुम् भवान् (agent), उपासितो गुरुः भवता (object), उपासितं भवता (act); अनूषितो गुरुम् भवान् (agent), अनूषितो गुरुः भवता (object), अनूषितं भवता (act); अनुजातो माणवको माणविकाम् (agent), अनुजाता माणवकेन माणविका (object), अनुजातं माणवकेन (act); आरूढो वृक्षं भवान् (agent), आरूढो वृक्षो भवता (object), आरूढं भवता (act); अनुजीर्णो वृषलीं देवदत्तः (agent), अनुजीर्णा वृषली देवदत्तेन (object), अनुजीर्णं देवदत्तेन (act). The verbs श्लिष् &c, become transitive with certain prepositions or _upasargas_, hence they have been mentioned here. Otherwise there was no necessity of mentioning them separately; as they, being intransitive verbs, when without prepositions, would be included in the word _akarmaka_ of the _sutra_.",
    "34073": "The word दाश comes from the root दाशृ 'to give' by adding  affix अच् under rule (III. 1. 134). This being a कृदन्त word would have otherwise denoted the agent by rule (III. 4. 67) of this chapter. The present _sutra_ makes it denote the recipient or have the force of the dative case. Thus दाश means 'to whom something is given i. e. a servant'. Similarly _goghna_ does not mean 'the killer of cow' but 'he on whose coming the cow is killed in order to give him, that is to say, a guest'. It is this irregularly-formed word _goghna_ which is made applicable to the priests, guests, sons-in-law &c, and not the regularly-formed word _goghna_ which means 'a killer of cow' or a '_Chandal_'. Thus दाशः = दाशन्ति तस्मै; गोघ्नः = तस्मै दातुं गां घ्नन्ति ॥",
    "34074": "These words are formed by _Unadi_ affixes. Thus भी + मक् = भीम (_Un_. I. 145, 148); भी + षुक् + मक् =भीष्म (_Un_. I. 148) &c. By the next _sutra_, _Unadi_ words do not denote ordinarily the recipient and the ablation.\n\nThe present _sutra_ makes them do so in the case of भीमादि words. The following is a list of _Bhimadi_words :- भीमः, भीष्मः, भयानकः (_Un_. III. 82), वरुः, चरुः, (_Un_. I. 7), भूमिः (_Un_. IV. 45), रजः (_Un_. IV. 217), संस्कारः, सङ्क्रन्दनः, प्रपतनः, समुद्रः, स्रुचः, or स्रुवः (_Un_. II. 61),स्रक् (_Un_. II. 62) खलतिः ।",
    "34075": "The _Unadi_ affixes being a subdivision of _krit_ affixes, would have, by rule (III. 4. 67), denoted the agent. By the present _sutra_ they are made to denote the object, the instrument and the location also. The word ताभ्यां has been used in the _sutra_ in order to include the word _sampradana_ also. For, had the _sutra_ been अन्यत्रोणादयः, only the _Apadana_ _karaka_ would have been excluded, as being the nearest; but not so the _Sampradana_ _karaka_. Thus कृषितोऽसौ = कृषिः (_Un_. IV. 120) 'agriculture i.e. what is ploughed' (object); तन्यत इति = तन्तुः (_Un_. 1. 69) 'a thread i.e. what is drawn out'; वृत्तमिति वर्त्म (_Un_. IV. 145) 'a way i.e. what is established'; चरितं = चर्म (_Un_. IV. 145) 'skin' (in which they live).",
    "34076": "The verbs denoting ध्रौव्य or 'persisting in a place' are Intransitive verbs. The word _pratyavasana_ means 'eating' also; the force of च in the _sutra_ is that the affix _kta_ expresses other relations also. Thus after verbs denoting 'fixedness' or _dhrauvyartha_ it denotes the agent, the act and the location; after verbs denoting 'motion' it gives the sense of agent, object, act and location; after verbs denoting 'taking or eating', it has the sense of object, act and location. Thus आसितो देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ sat'; आसितं तेन 'sitting by him' (act); इदमेषामासितम् 'this was their seat' (location); यातो देवदत्तो ग्रामम् '_Devadatta_ went to the village' (active); यातो देवदत्तेन ग्रामः (passive); यातं देवदत्तेन (abstract); इदमेषां यातम् 'this is their place of going' (location); भुक्त ओदनो देवदत्तेन (passive); भुक्त ओदनं देवदत्तः (active); देवदत्तेन भुक्तम् (abstract); इदमेषां भुक्तम् (location); कथं भुक्ता ब्राह्मणाः । पीता गावः । The आ in भुक्ता and पीता has the force of मतुप् (IV. 2. 85). भुक्तमेषामस्ति or पीतमेषामस्ति ।",
    "34077": "This _sutra_ consists of one word लस्य meaning 'of ल'. It is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. The word लस्य is the genitive singular of ल, the अ in ल being for the sake of pronunciation. The ल means the ten affixes: लट् present, लिट् perfect, लुट् first future, लृट् second future, लोट् imperative लेट् Vedic subjunctive, लङ् imperfect, लिङ् potential and benedictive, लुङ् aorist, लृङ् conditional. Six of these tenses have indicatory ट्, and four have indicatory ङ् । \n\nProfessor Bohtlingk translates this _sutra_ thus:- In the following _sutras_, the word लस्य should be supplied to complete the sense, i.e. the phrase 'in the place of all those endings which are known as the Personal endings of various tenses and moods, and are known in their totality as ल' ।",
    "34078": "These are the well-known Conjugational-affixes, called also Personal endings, and are ordained generally after all the ten tenses. But as a matter of fact, they undergo various additions and alterations in the different tenses. Some of these changes have already been mentioned before; see _sutra_ (II 4. 85), (III. 1. 33), &c. Others will be mentioned hereafter. It is only in the present tense or लट् that the affixes as above given, may be applied to the root, in some cases, without any alteration.\n\nThe प in तिप्, सिप् and मिप् is for the sake of accent (III. 1. 4); the ट् in इट् for distinguishing it in the _sutra_ इटोऽत् (III. 4. 106); and the ङ in महिङ् for forming the _Pratyahara_ तिङ् which is the general name of the above 18 conjugational or personal affixes. Stripped off their indicatory letters, the following table shows the conjugational affixes as added under various tenses:-\n\nPRESENT TENSE.--लट् ।\n\n_Parasmaipada_.\n\n- 3rd person, ति, तस्, अन्ति\n- 2nd person, सि, थस्, थ\n- 1st person, मि, वस्, मस्\n\n_Atmanepada_.\n\n- 3rd person, ते, आते, अन्ते\n- 2nd person, से, आथे, ध्वे\n- 1st person, ए, वहे, महे\n\nIMPERFECT OR FIRST PRETERITE.—लङ् ।\n\n_Parasmaipada_.\n\n- 3rd person, त्, ताम्, अन्\n- 2nd person, स्, तम्, त\n- 1st person, अम्, व, म\n\n_Atmanepada_.\n\n- 3rd person, त, आताम्, अन्त\n- 2nd person, थास्, आथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person, इ, वहि, महि  \n\nPOTENTIAL OR OPTATIVE.—विधिलिङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, यात्, याताम्, युस्\n- 2nd person, यास्, यातम्, यात\n- 1st person, याम्, याव, याम  \n\n- 3rd person, ईत, ईयाताम्, ईरन्\n- 2nd person, ईथास्, ईयाथाम्, ईध्वम्\n- 1st person, ईय, ईवहि, ईमहि  \n\nIMPERATIVE.--लोट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, तु, ताम, अन्तु\n- 2nd person, हि, तम्, त\n- 1st person, आनि, आव, आम  \n\n- 3rd person, ताम्, आताम्, अन्ताम्\n- 2nd person, स्व, आथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person, ऐ, आवहै, आमहै  \n\nPERFECT OR SECOND PRETERITE.—लिट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, अ, अतुस्, उस्\n- 2nd person, थ, अथुस्, अ\n- 1st person, अ, व, म  \n\n- 3rd person, ए, आते, इरे\n- 2nd person, से, आथे, ध्वे\n- 1st person, ए, वहे, महे  \n\nFIRST FUTURE OR DEFINITE FUTURE.—लुट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, ता, तारौ, तारस्\n- 2nd person, तासि, तास्थस्, तास्थ\n- 1st person, तास्मि, तास्वस्, तास्मस्  \n\n- 3rd person, ता, तारौ, तारस्\n- 2nd person, तासे, तासाथे, ताध्वे\n- 1st person, ताहे, तास्वहे, तास्महे  \n\nSECOND FUTURE OR INDEFINITE FUTURE.—लृट् ।\n\n- 3rd person, स्यति, स्यतस्, स्यन्ति\n- 2nd person, स्यसि, स्यथस्, स्यथ\n- 1st person, स्यामि, स्यावस्, स्यामस्  \n\n- 3rd person, स्यते, स्येते, स्यन्ते\n- 2nd person, स्यसे, स्यथे, स्यध्वे\n- 1st person, स्ये, स्यावहे, स्यामहे  \n\nAORIST OR THIRD PRETERITE.—लुङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, सीत्, स्ताम्, सुस्\n- 2nd person, सीस्, स्तम्, स्त\n- 1st person, सम्, स्व, स्म\n\n- 3rd person, स्त, साताम्, सत\n- 2nd person, स्थास्, साथाम्, ध्वम्\n- 1st person, सि, स्वहि, स्महि  \n\nPRECATIVE OR BENEDICTIVE.—आशीर्लिङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, यात्, यास्ताम्, यासुस्\n- 2nd person, यास्, यास्तम्, यास्त\n- 1st person, यासम्, यास्व, यास्म  \n\n- 3rd person, सीष्ठ, सीयास्ताम्, सीरन्\n- 2nd person, सीष्ठास्, सीयास्थाम्, सीध्वम्\n- 1st person, सीय, सीवहि, सीमहि  \n\nCONDITIONAL.—लृङ् ।\n\n- 3rd person, स्यत्, स्यताम्, स्यन्\n- 2nd person, स्यस्, स्यतम्, स्यत\n- 1st person, स्यम्, स्याव, स्याम  \n\n- 3rd person, स्यत, स्येताम्, स्यन्त\n- 2nd person, स्यथास्, स्येस्थाम्, स्यध्वम्\n- 1st person, स्ये, स्यावहि, स्यामहि",
    "34079": "The ल or the tense-affixes that have an indicatory ट् are six:- लट्, लिट्, लुट्, लृट्, लोट्, लेट् । In these tenses the final portion called टि of the _Atmanepada_ affixes is changed into ए । Thus त becomes ते, आताम् becomes आते, झ becomes झे &c, as shown in the foregoing table.\n\nThe affixes शानच्, and कानच् are also _Atmanepada_ affixes. Why are not their finals changed into ए as in पचमानः, यजमानः? Because the word आत्मनेपदानां in the _sutra_ refers by context to the _Atmanepada_ affixes included in the _Pratyahara_ तिङ् ।",
    "34080": "In the six tenses already mentioned in the last _sutra_, the _Atmanepada_ थास् is replaced by से, as we have already shown in the preceding table. Thus पचसे, पेचिषे, पक्तासे, पक्ष्यसे ।",
    "34081": "The श् of एश् indicates that it replaces the whole of the affix त (I. 1. 55). The च् of इरेच् is for the sake of accent (VI. I. 165). Thus पेचे, पेचाते पेचिरे । See the foregoing table of tenses for the _Atmanepada_.",

The indicatory ण् is for the sake of causing वृद्धि (VII. 2. 25). Thus पपाच, पेचतुः, पेचुः, पेचिथ or पपक्थ, पेचथुः, पेच, पपाच or पपच, पेचिव पेचिम ।",
    "34083": "Thus:--\n\n- 3rd person, वेद or वेत्ति, विदतुः or वित्तः, विदुः or विदन्ति,\n- 2nd person, वेत्थ or वेत्सि, विदथुः or वित्थः, विद or वित्थ,\n- 1st person, वेद or वेद्मि, विद्व or विद्वः, विद्म or विद्मः",
    "34084": "Thus आह 'he says'; आहतुः 'they two say'; आहुः 'they say'; आत्थ 'thou sayst'; आहथुः 'you two say'; the rest like ब्रू as shown below:--\n\n- 3rd person, आह or ब्रवीति, आहतुः or ब्रूतः, आहुः or ब्रुवन्ति\n- 2nd person, आत्थ or ब्रवीषि, आहथुः or ब्रूथः, ब्रूत्थ\n- 1st person, ब्रवीमि, ब्रूवः, ब्रूमः\n\nThe word आदितः 'first' is used in the _sutra_ to indicate that the substitution should not take place in the case of the last four affixes. The repetition of the word ब्रुवः in the _sutra_ indicates the original expression which is to be replaced; and shows that this change occurs in the _Parasmaipada_ affixes only.",
    "34085": "This is an अतिदेश _sutra_; as in the लङ् there are the affixes ताम्, तम्, त, व and म, so also in the लोट् । Thus पचताम्, पचतम्, पचत, पचाव, पचाम ।\n\nQ -- If लोट् is like लङ्, why have we not the augment अट्, आट्, or the substitution of जुस् or झि (see (III. 4. 111)) in the case of लोट् also ?\n\nA. -- The वा of _sutra_ (III. 4. 83) is understood in this _sutra_ also, so that the analogy between लोट् and लङ् is a limited analogy and does not make all the rules which are applicable to लङ्, equally applicable to लोट् also.",
    "34086": "Thus ति becomes तु, अन्ति becomes अन्तु, as have already been given in the above table.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of affixes हि and नि of लोट् । In the case of these two affixes, the इ is not changed into उ, either because they have been so taught in the _sutras_, or because the वा of _sutra_ (III. 4. 83) is understood here also and makes this rule an optional rule of limited scope as in the last _sutra_ (व्यवस्थित विभाषा). Thus पचतु, पचन्तु ।\n\nIn fact, this _sutra_ is confined to ति and झि only and does not apply to सि to which the next _sutra_ applies.",
    "34087": "The substitute being like the original expression (1. 1. 56), हि substituted for सिप्, would have been a पित् affix, but for this _sutra_, which clearly states in its latter portion that this हि is not to be regarded as having an indicatory प ।\n\nThus लुनीहि, पुनीहि, राध्नुहि, तक्ष्णुहि; and as this affix is अपित्, rule (1. 2. 4) makes it ङित् also, and thereby no _guna_ takes place.",
    "34088": "The result is that in the _Chhandas_ the second person singular of लोट् has two forms as प्रीणाहि or प्रीणीहि; युयुधि or युयोधि, धि being substituted for हि in the Vedas, by rule (VI. 4. 103) as in the following verse:\n\nअग्ने॒॒ नय॑ सु॒॒पथा॑रा॒॒येऽअ॒॒स्मान्विश्वा॑निदेव व॒॒यूना॑निविद्वा॒॒न् ।\nयु योध्य॒॒स्मज्जु॑हुरा॒॒णमेनो॒॒भूयि॑ष्ठान्ते॒॒ नमाऽउक्तिम्विधेम ॥\n\n                          --_Rig_ 1. 189. 1: _Yajur_ _Veda_. 40. 16.",
    "34089": "This supersedes the rule relating to the change of इ into उ, and the rule of _lopa_; see the table; thus पचानि, पठानि ।",
    "34090": "This relates to the _Atmanepada_ affix ए. In the _Atmanepada_, आम् is substituted for ए in the Imperative; see the table; पचताम्, पचेताम्, पचन्ताम् ।",
    "34091": "This supersedes the आम् substitution of the last _sutra_. Thus, for से we have स्व, and for ध्वे we have ध्वम्; see the table; thus पचस्व, पचध्वम् ।",
    "34092": "This is clear. Thus in the _Parasmaipada_, we have आनि, आव, आम । Thus करवाणि, करवाव, करवाम; करवै, करवावहै, करवामहै ।",
    "34093": "This relates to the _Atmanepada_ affix. Thus करवै, करवावहै, करवामहै ।\n\nBut the ए resulting from _sandhi_, is not to be changed into ऐ । Thus पचाव + इदम् = पचावेदम्, पचाम + इदम् = पचामेदम् । Here, no doubt, the ए belongs to the Imperative by (VI. 1. 85), being the substitute of अ of म and व. But this is not to be changed into ऐ on the maxim that this ए is the result of a बहिरङ्ग rule, for the rule of _sandhi_ (VI. 1. 87), is a बहिरङ्ग rule, while the present _sutra_ is an अन्तरङ्ग rule; because of the following _Paribhasha_, असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे 'that which is _Bahiranga_ is regarded as not having taken effect, when an _Antaranga_ rule is to be applied.",
    "34094": "The augments अट् and आठ् are not to be added at once, but by turns. Thus जुष् + सिप् + अट् + त् = जोषिषत्; तारिषत्, मान्दिषत्; similarly पत् + आट् + ति = पताति; च्यावयाति । See (III. 1. 34) for the addition of सिप् in the above.",
    "34095": "Thus मन्त्रयैते, मन्त्रयैथे, करवैते, करवैथे । Why is not the augment आट् changed into ऐ ? Because otherwise the rule enjoining आट् would be superfluous.",
    "34096": "Thus शयै, ईशै, &c, in the following examples:- सप्ताहानि शयै, अहमेव पशूनामीशै, मदया एव वो ग्रहा गृह्यान्तै, मद्देवत्यान्येव वः पात्राण्युच्यान्तै । And in the alternative we have simply ए, as यत्र क्व च ते मनो दक्षम् दधसउत्तरम् ।\n\nWhy do we say 'in other places than these governed by the last _sutra_'?

Though लिङ् has an indicatory ङ्, and therefore by the rule (I. I. 56), its substitutes would also be regarded as having an indicatory ङ्, the repetition of the word ङित् in this _sutra_ shows the existence of the _paribhasha_ \"that the ङ् belonging to ल does not influence its substitutes;\" in other words, the substitutes of लङ्, लिङ्, लुङ् and लृङ् are not to be regarded as having an indicatory ङ् (लकाराश्रयङित्वमादेशानां न भवति).

Thus इष्यात्, इष्यास्ताम्, इष्यासुः, and जागर्यात्, जागर्यास्ताम् and जागर्यासुः । In the Potential, वच्यात् (no _samprasarana_); in the Benedictive, उच्यात् (vocalisation).

The reduplicated verbs, as well as the verb विद्, form their third person plural in जुस्, in the tenses other than लिङ्, and those that take सिच् । The word ङितः of _sutra_ (III. 4. 99), is understood here also; and therefore this rule is restricted to the Imperfect (लङ्) of the reduplicated verb. Thus of सिच्, we have अकार्षुः, अहार्षः । Similarly, after the Imperfect of the reduplicated verbs, we have अविभयुः, अजिहयुः, अजागरुः । In the case of विद्, we have अविदुः ।",

But where the सिच् is not elided, there, of course, जुस् does come. Thus अकार्षुः, अहार्षुः ।",

The repetition shows that the rule applies to those affixes which come after लङ् as लङ्, and not to those which come after another tense which is treated like लङ् । Thus लोट् is treated like लङ्, but for the purposes of this rule, लोट् would not be so treated. Thus the झि of लोट् will not be changed into जुस् by (III. 4. 109). Thus बिभ्यतु, जाग्रतु, विदन्तु । The word एव has been used in the _sutra_, for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_.",

    "34114": "Thus the affixes तृ, तुम्, तव्यम् &c. are आर्धधातुक affixes as in the following words- लविता, लवितुम्, लवितव्यम् । Here the augment इट् is added, because of these affixes being called _ardhadhatuka_ by (VII. 2. 35).\n\nThe word धातोः whose _anuvritti_ began with _sutra_ (III. 1. 91), is understood here also. So that the affixes in relation to the verbal roots get the name of _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_; the affixes applied to nouns do not get these names. Thus the case-affix भ्याम् when added to the noun लू, is not called an _arthadhatuka_ affix, and therefore we have लूभ्याम्, लूभिः &c. Had these affixes been _ardhadhatuka_, they would have caused the _guna_ of the base (VII. 3. 84). Similarly the affixes त्वं and ता in the words वृक्षत्वं and वृक्षता are not _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Had they been so, there would have been the insertion of the augment इट् (VII. 2. 35).\n\nSimilarly in _sutra_ (III. I. 5), the affix सन् is used without changing the sense, after the roots गुप्, तिज् and कित् । But as this affix is added without the enunciation of the word धातोः as it is in _sutra_ (III. 1. 7), this सन् is not called _ardhadhatuka_, and does not take the augment इट्, as जुगुप्सते ।",
    "34115": "This debars them from being called _sarvadhatuka_ and, being _ardhadhatuka_, some of them take the augment इट्; as पेचिथ, शेकिथ । Moreover by their being _ardhadhatuka_ they do not admit of the _Vikaranas_ शप् &c.\n\nSo from ग्लै (ग्ला, VI. 1. 45) we have जग्ले; here the आ is elided by (VI. 4. 64), the affix being treated as _ardhadhatuka_; similarly मम्ले from म्लै ।",
    "34116": "This debars these affixes from being called _sarvadhatuka_. Being _ardhadhatuka_ they take the augment इट्, and before these affixes the root does not take the _Vikaranas_ शप् &c. Thus from the root लू 'to cut', we have in the आशीर्लिङ्, लविसीष्ट; and from the root पू 'to purify', पविषीष्ट. But in the विधिलिङ् (Potential), we have the proper _Vikaranas_ &c. as लुनीयात्, पुनीयात् ।",
    "34117": "In the Vedas, there is no hard and fast rule about _sarvadhatuka_ and  _ardhadhatuka_ affixes. Sometimes the तिङ् and शित् are treated as if they were _ardhadhatuka_. Thus वर्धन्तु त्वा सुष्टुतयः । Here the affixes of the लोट् are treated as _ardhadhatuka_ and consequently there is the elision of the णिच् by rule (VI. 4. 51); the proper form of this word would be वर्धयन्तु । Sometimes ardhadhatuka_ affixes are treated like _sarvadhatuka_ affixes; as विशृण्विरे; here the affixes of the लिट् are treated as _sarvadhatuka_ and so there is the _Vikarana_  श्नु and the उ is changed into व । Thus, वि + शृ + श्नु + इरे = वि + शृ + नु + इरे (III. 1. 74) = वि + शृ + न्व् + इरे (VI. 4. 87) = विशृण्विरे । Similarly, सुन्विरे । The लिङ् is sometimes treated in the Vedas both as _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_ at one and the same time; as  उपस्थेयाम् शरणं बृहन्तम् । Here, by treating the affix as _sarvadhatuka_, there is elision of स in the लिङ् (VII. 2. 79) and by treating it again as _ardhadhatuka_, the आ of स्था is changed into ए । So also in स्वस्ति the affix is treated as _sarvadhatuka_ and there is no substitution of भू for अस् as required by (II. 4. 52).",
    "41001": "This is an '_adhikara_' aphorism pure and simple. It simply consists of terms which other aphorisms, in order to complete their sense, are under the necessity of borrowing. In other words, this _sutra_ points out the base प्रकृति to which the affixes beginning with सु treated of in the next _sutra_, and ending with कप् (V. 4. 151), are to be applied.\n\nThe _sutra_ consists of three words. The term ङी is a common name for the three affixes ङीप्, ङीष्, and ङीन् ॥ The term आप्, is the common name for the three affixes टाप्, डाप् and चाप् ॥ These are feminine affixes and are taught from _sutra_ 4 to 65 of this chapter. The word प्रातिपदिक means 'a Nominal stem' and has been defined in _sutra_ (I. 2. 45), (I. 2. 46), i. e. that which is possessed of a meaning, not being a root or an affix; or what ends with a _Krit_ or a _Taddhita_ affix. The word ङ्याप् प्रातिपदिकात् is a _Samahara_-_dvandva_  or Collective aggregate of these three words.\n\nQ. All affixes are placed after the base (See _Sutra_ (III. 1. 2)); the affixes treated of in the last Book were to be placed after the root ('_dhatu_'); the remaining affixes taught in Books Fourth and Fifth, will therefore, be placed after all such bases प्रकृति which are not roots (_dhatu_); and such bases remaining are  _pratipadika_ and feminine words. What is then the necessity of making this _sutra_, when these _pratipadika_ &c, are the only bases left to us to apply the affixes taught herein-after ?\n\nA. To this we reply, the necessity of making this _sutra_ arose from the following considerations: that the word ङ्याप् प्रतिपदिकात् should qualify the words 'वृद्ध' 'अवृद्ध,' 'the letter अ,' 'अनुदात्तादि', and 'द्व्यच्,' wherever used in the following _sutras_. So that, where a rule says: \"let such an affix be applied to a _Vriddha_ word,\" we must understand it to mean, \"let such an affix be applied to a _Vriddha_ word which is a _pratipadika_, or which ends with '_ni_' or '_ap_'; and not to every _Vriddha_ word.\" The principal aphorism, besides the present, which regulates the application of _Taddhita_ affixes, is (IV. 1. 82), which declares:- \"The _taddhita_ affixes, on the alternative of their being employed al all, come after the word that is signified by the first of the words in construction.\" Thus (IV. 1. 157) says;-- \"The affix फिञ् is added, according to the opinion of Northern Grammarians, in the sense of 'descendant,' after a word which is entitled to the designation of _Vriddham_, provided it does not end with a _Gotra_ affix.\" Thus the idea, 'the son of _Amragupta_,' may be expressed either by the phrase 'आम्रगुप्तस्यापत्यम्'; or by adding the affix '_phin_' to the first of the word in construction, viz, '_amraguptasya_,' which is a _Vriddha_ word (1. 1. 73). But can we apply the affix '_phin_' to the first of the word in construction in the following, ज्ञानाम् ब्राह्मणानामपत्यम्'; because the word '_jnanam_' the genitive plural of '_jna_', is a _Vriddha_ word ? Certainly not, because the word '_pratipadikat_' must be read into this _sutra_ (IV. I. 157), and the affix '_phin_' should be added after that _Vriddha_ word which is in its crude-form also a _Vriddham_, and not that which becomes _Vriddham_ only in construction. Now the _pratipadika_ of '_jnanam_' is '_jna_', the latter is not a _vriddham_, therefore, the rule does not apply to it. So also the word '_jna_' is a _vriddham_ in its _pratipadika_ state; but in the following phrase, it loses its _vriddha_ nature; 'ज्ञयो र्ब्राह्मनोरपत्त्यम्' meaning 'the son of two wise _Brahman_ ladies'. Still the affix '_phin_' must be added to the word '_jnyor_', because its _pratipadika_ is a _vriddha_ word (2) Similarly the word 'अवृद्ध' (_sutra_ (IV. I. 160); 'the affix _phin_ is applied diversely to a non-_vriddha_ word, according to the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians') must be qualified by the word '_pratipadika_'; otherwise it would lead to similar incongruous results as in the last aphorism. (3) Similarly the word अत् in _Sutra_ (IV. 1. 95) ('the affix इञ् is added after a word which ends in the letter अ') must be qualified by the word '_pratipadika_'; that is to say, the word in its crude-form must end in अ, and not necessarily when it is in construction. If it were not so; then the affix 'इञ्' will apply only to the word 'दक्षस्य' in 'दक्षस्यापत्त्यम्' but will not apply to the words 'दक्षयोः', or 'दक्षानाम्' in the phrases 'दक्षयोरपत्त्यम्' or 'दक्षानामपत्त्यम्' ॥ But the affix applies to all those three words.\n\n(4). Similarly the word 'अनुदात्तादेः' in (IV. 2. 44), (the affix अञ् is added to a word which has the grave accent on its beginning), must be qualified by the word _pratipadika_. That is, the word in its crude form must have the grave accent on its initial, though in construction, it may or may not have grave accent. Otherwise, the affix 'इञ्' will apply to the words 'वाचः' and 'त्वचः' which in construction are _anudattadi_ as in 'वाचो विकारः' (VI. 1. 168); but which in their crude-forms (वाक्, त्वच्) are _udattadi_. And conversely, the affix 'अञ्,' will not apply to the word 'सर्वेषाम्' which in construction is _udattadi_, as, 'सर्वेषाम् विकारः,' but which in its crude-form is _anudattadi_.\n\n(5). Similarly the word 'द्व्यचः' in (IV. 4. 7), (the affix 'ठन्' is employed after words consisting of two vowels, when the sense is that of crossing), must be qualified by the word _pratipadika_. That is, the word in its _pratipadika_ state must consist of two vowels, though in construction it may consist of more than two syllables. Otherwise, this affix will not apply to the word घटेन in the phrase 'घटेन तरति', while it will apply to the words 'वाचा' and 'त्वचा' in the phrases, 'वाचा तरति,' 'त्वचा तरति'. But this is undesirable.\n\nQ Why have we employed the word '_ny_-_ap_' in the aphorism? Is not the word _pratipadika_ wide enough to include the words ending with the feminine affixes, by virtue of the _paribhasha_:-- \"A _pratipadika_ denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, also such a crude-form as is derived from it by the addition of an affix denoting gender\" ?\n\nA. Not so. The _paribhasha_ you quote applies to that case, where there is a rule, relating to an individual word-form, given in the _Sutra_ itself. In other words, \"this _paribhasha_ is applicable when a word is employed in grammar which either denotes _pratipadikas_ generally (as the word '_pratipadika_' does in this _sutra_) or denotes a particular _pratipadika_, (such as the words युवा, खलति, पलित, वलिन, and जरति, in (II. 1. 67)).\" That is, in (II. 1. 67), the masculine form _yuva_, also includes the feminine : but not so every-where. Moreover the words, ङी, आप् have been employed in the _Sutra_, in order to make the _Taddhita_ affixes applicable to feminine words ending in long ई (ङी) or long आ (आप्). Thus the feminine of 'काल', and 'हरिण' is, 'काली', and 'हरिणी', the feminine of 'खट्वा' and 'माला' is 'खट्वा' and 'माला' । After these words we can apply the _Taddhita_ affix तरप् : as 'कालितरा', 'हरिणितरा', 'खट्वातरा', and 'मालातरा' ॥\n\nNow, had we not used the word '_ny_-_ap_' in the _Sutra_, and wished to express the same idea as is done, say, by the word '_kalitara_,' we could not have got this form at all.\n\nQ. The word काल takes ङीप् by (IV. I. 42); to which when तरप् is added, the vowel is shortened by (VI. 3. 43); and we shall get the form कालितरा ॥ Why do you then say that the _Taddhita_ affixes could not be applied, but for the words _ny_-_ap_?\n\nA. To this we answer, that by the rule of _vipratishedha_, the _Taddhita_ would have debarred the feminine. Thus, when feminine alone is meant and not comparison, we shall have काली; and when comparison alone is meant and not feminine, we shall have कालतर; but when both feminine and comparison are meant, then would arise the difficulty; and according to the general maxim, the _Taddhita_ would have debarred the feminine. But by using the word _ny_-_ap_, it is shown that first the feminine affixes are to be added, and then the comparison making affixes.",

I. 64) but for their enumeration in the '_ajadi_' class; 'त्रिफला' when a _Dvigu_ Compound forms its feminine as त्रिफला; when a _Bahuvrihi_ Compound, its feminine is त्रिफली ॥\n\n21. सत्पुष्प, सत्पुश्पा; 22. प्राक्पुष्प, प्राक्पुष्पा;\n23. काण्डपुष्प, काण्डपुष्पा; 24. प्रान्तपुष्प, प्रान्तपुष्पा;\n25. शतपुष्प, शतपुष्पा; 26. एकपुष्प, एकपुष्पा;\n\nThe above words ending in पुष्प would have taken _nish_ by (IV. 1. 64).\n\n27. शूद्र शूद्रा\n\nB. N. But the feminine of शूद्र is शूद्री when the meaning is 'the wife of a _sudra_'; so also when the word शूद्र is compounded with the word महत् as, महाशूद्री 'a woman of 'महाशूद्र' class'.\n\nThe term 'महाशूद्र' is applied to the caste of _Abhiras_: and this compound word would have taken the affix 'टाप्' by the rule of _tadanta_ _vidhi_ given in (I. 1. 72), but for the _vartika_, viz 'शूद्रा चामहत पूर्वा जातिः' It might be objected that the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ cannot apply here on the strength of the following maxim:- “That which cannot possibly be anything but a _pratipadika_ does not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself”. Therefore, the word '_sudra_' which cannot be anything but a _pratipadika_, does not denote '_maha_-_sudra_'. This objection is futile: the very fact of this _vartika_ indicates by implication (_jnapaka_), that with regard to the application of the feminine affixes, the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ is valid and does apply. Thus we have the forms like अतिधीवरी अतिपीवरी and अतिभवती\n\n28. क्रुंच् क्रुंचा 29. उष्णिह् उष्णिहा 30. देवविश् देवविशा  \n\nN. B. The above words end in consonants and would not have taken 'टाप्' but for their being included in the 'अजादि' class.\n\n31. ज्येष्ठ ज्येष्ठा 32. कनिष्ठ कनिष्ठा 33. मध्यम मध्यमा\n\nB. N. The above words denoting matrimonial realtion would have taken the affix '_nish_' by (IV. 1. 46).\n\n34. अमूल अमूला The word '_mula_' preceded by the negative particle _nan_, would have otherwise taken '_nish_' by (IV. 1. 64).",
    "41005": "Of the affix ङीप्, the letter ङ् is taken in order to make a common term with ङीष् and ङीन्; and the प् is taken to distinguish _ti_ from those affixes; the real affix is ई । Thus, कर्तृ;-- f. कर्त्री; हर्तृ—f. हर्त्री; दण्डिन्—f. दण्डिनी; छत्रिन्,-- f. छत्रिनी ॥",
    "41006": "The उक् is a _pratyahara_ meaning उ, ऋ and त । Wherever it is possible to make these letters indicatory, in whatever way it may be, that word-form is called उगित् । That which ends with such a word is meant here. A _pratipadika_ pure and simple, not formed by an affix, may be उगित्, thus the pronoun भवतु among the _sarvanamas_: an affix may be उगित् as the affixes क्तवतु and शतृ, and therefore, the words formed by these affixes will be उगित्; similarly a letter may be उगित् as तृ meaning त् in (VI. 4. 127), (“तु is the substitute of the final of an inflective base ending in अर्वन् &c”)\n\nThus, भवत् 'honored' sir.—f. भवती 'madam'. Applying the rule of _tadantavidhi_, we have अतिभवत्-अतिभवती 'most exalted lady'. Similarly पचत् (formed by adding शतृ (III. 2. 124)), forms the feminine पचन्ती, the नुम् comes by (VII. I. 82). So also यजनी 'a female sacrificing'; अर्वत् अर्वती 'a mare'.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of verbal roots having an indicatory '_uk_'. Thus the roots स्रंसु 'to fall down', ध्वंसु 'to fall down' have indicatory उ; and we get from these roots, the _pratipadikas_ like उखास्रत् and पर्णध्वत्,(III. 2. 76). The उखास्रत् ब्राह्मणी, पर्णध्वत् ब्राह्मणी ॥ Here, the feminine is not formed by adding ङीप् ।\n\nVart:- The _pratipadikas_ ending with the verb '_anchu_', however, take the affix ङीप् । As, प्राची, प्रती़ही, उदीची ॥",
    "41007": "Thus धीवन् (_Unadi_ IV. 115) f. धीवरी 'a female artisan'; पीवन् f. पीवरी 'a young woman, a stout woman', शर्वन् f. शर्वरी 'night' (शृ + वनिप् (III. 2. 75)) lit. that which destroys light. So also परलोकदृश्वरी ॥\n\nWords ending in वन् are formed by the affixes ङ्वनिप्, (III. 2. 103) क्वनिप् and वनिप् (III. 2. 74) These words end in न् and consequently would have taken ङीप् even by (IV. 1. 5); the necessity of the present _sutra_ arose in order to teach the change of न् into र् in case of words ending in वन् ॥\n\nVart:- If the affix वन् is ordained to be added to a word ending in हश्, (a letter of हश् _pratyahara_), and is thus immediately preceded by a soft consonant then this rule does not apply, that is to say, there is neither the application of the affix ङीप् nor the change of म् into र् ॥ Thus सहयुध्वन् is both masculine and feminine as, सहयुध्वा ब्राह्मणः or ब्राह्मणी 'a _Brahman_ brother or sister in arms'. In शर्वन् the वन् is preceded by र् which is a letter of हश् class, but as वन् is not ordained to be applied to शर् but to शृ, and we get the र् indirectly by _guna_, the _vartika_ does not apply to such a case. Hence शर्वरी ॥",
    "41008": "The word पाद becomes पाद् when final in certain _Bahuvrihi_ compounds (V. 4. 140). Thus द्विपात् is both masculine and feminine, or it may optionally form its feminine by long ई (ङीप्). In the latter alternative, the form will be द्विपदी, the word पाद् being replaced by पद् by (VI. 4. 130), (as read with (I. 4. 18)). Similarly त्रिपात् or त्रिपदी; चतुष्पाद् or चतुष्पदी ॥",
    "41009": "This debars ङीप् ॥ Thus द्विपदा ऋक् 'a _Rik_ verse consisting of two quarter verses'; similarly त्रिपदा ऋक्, चतुष्पदा ऋक् ॥ Why do we say \"when denoting a ' _Rik_' verse\" ? Observe द्विपदी देवदत्ता '_Devadatta_ (a woman) having two feet'.",
    "41010": "This prohibits all feminine affixes that would otherwise have presented themselves. Thus पञ्च ब्राह्मण्यः 'the five _Brahmani_ ladies'. So also सप्त, नव, दश &c are feminine as well as masculine. The following words belong to the _Svasradi_ class:- स्वसा 'a sister', दुहिता 'a daughter'; ननान्दा 'a husband's sister', याता 'a husband's brother's wife', माता 'a mother', तिस्रः 'three'. चतस्रः 'four'.",
    "41011": "By (IV. 1. 5), _pratipadikas_ ending in मन् would have taken the affix ङीप्, in as much as they end in न्; but the present _sutra_ prohibits that. Thus दामन् 'a string' is both neuter and feminine; and is declined as follows:- I. S. दामा; d. दामानौ, pl. दामानः ॥ Similarly पामा, पामानौ, पामानः ॥\n\nHere by using the term मन् we mean words formed by an affix whose effective element is मन्, such as the affix मनिन् (_Unadi_ IV. 144) in the words दामन् (दो + मानिन्) and पामन्; as well as words which end in मन् which does not represent an affix. This is done on the strength of the following _paribhasha_ :- अनिनसमन ग्रहणान्यर्थवता चनर्थकेन च तदन्तविधिं प्रयोजयन्ति ॥ \"Wherever अन् or इन् or अस् or मन्, when they are employed in grammar denote by (I. I. 72) something that ends with अन् or इन् or अस् or मन्, there अन्, इन्, अस्, and मन represent these combinations of letters both in so far as they possess, and also in so far as they are void of, a meaning.\" Therefore, words like सीमन् and अतिमहिमन्, where मन् is not an affix, but an integral part of the word, are also governed by the present _sutra_. Thus, सीमा, सीमानौ, सीमानः अतिमहिमा, अतिमाहमानौ and अतिमहिमानः ।",
    "41012": "This refers to those _Bahuvrihi_ compounds in which the penultimate is not elided. Of the _Bahuvrihi_ compounds which lose their penultimate letter, it is optional to employ this affix or not; as it will be taught in (IV. I. 28). Thus सुपर्वन् 'possessed of beautiful joints' is both masculine and feminine. As सुपर्वा, सुपर्वाणौ, सुपर्वाणः; so also सुशर्मा, सुशर्माणौ and सुशर्माणः ॥ In these cases the penultimate अ of वन् or मन् is not elided. See (VI. 4. 137).\n\nWhy do we say \"after _Bahuvrihi_ compounds\" ? Because after any other compouds, this rule will not apply. As अतिराजन् is an _Avyayibhava_ compound, its feminine will be अतिराजी ॥",
    "41013": "Of the affix डाप्, the letter ड् indicates that the affix is to be added after the elision of the टि (I. 1. 64) of the base. Thus पामन् + डाप् = पाम् + आ = पामा, This being an optional rule we have I. s पामा d, पामे or पामानौ, pl, पामाः or पामानः; similarly with सीमा, as, सीमा, सीमे or सीमानौ, सीमाः or सीमानः ॥\n\nSo also in _Bahuvrihi_ compounds ending in अम्. As:-\n\nबहुराजा, बहुराजे or बहुराजानौ, बहुराजाः or बहुराजानः ॥\nबहुतक्षा, बहुतक्षे or बहुतक्षाणौ, बहुतक्षाः or बहुतक्षाणः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"optionally\" ? So that the option may apply to _sutra_ (IV. 1. 7) also; i. e. when a _pratipadika_ ending in वन्, which can be regarded as ending in अन्, is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, then the change of न् into र् and the application of ङीप् are optional we may apply the affix डाप् instead. As:-\nबहुधीवा or बहुधीवरी; बहुपीवा or बहुपीवरी ॥",
    "41014": "This is an _adhikara_ aphorism pure and simple, and has governing force upto (IV. 1. 77): and prohibits the application of affixes to '_upasarjanas_'. That is to say, whatever we shall treat of hereafter, is to be understood to apply to such terms only, which are not _upasarjana_ or a subordinate term in a compound. (1. 2. 43). Thus the next _sutra_ declares \"the affix _nip_ is added in forming the feminine after what ends in short अ, if the affix with which it ends has an indicatory ट्, &c.\" Thus the word कुरुचर is formed by the affix ट (111.) 2. 16), and ends in अ. The feminine of this word will be formed by ङीप् as कुरुचरी, similarly मद्रचर—f मद्रचरी । But if these words being the last members of a compound, are treated as _upasarjana_ (1. 2. 43), then they will not take the affix ङीप् in the feminine. Now in a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, all the component members are _upasarjana_, (II. 2, 35); therefore, the feminine of such compounds will not take ङीप् ॥ Thus, बहुकुरुचरा or बहुमद्रचरा मधुरा ॥ Similarly (IV. 1. 63) says, \"the affix ङीप् is added after words denoting _jati_\" as, कुक्कुठी, शुकरी ॥ But where these words are _upasarjana_, '_nish_' will not be added : as, बहुकुक्कुटा बहुशूकरा मधुरा ॥\n\nAs a general rule, _tadanta_-_vidhi_ (I, 1, 72) does not apply to compounds; but the present _sutra_ indicates by implication that the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies to compounds for the purposes of the application of feminine affixes. For had it not been so, there would have been no necessity of making the present _sutra_ ; for a rule applicable to a simple word as such, would not have applied to it when it was part of a compound-- whether subordinate (_upasarjana_), or principal (_pradhana_). But the present _sutra_ indicates that the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ does apply, if the word does not become a subordinate member, but is regarded as the principal member, of a compound.\n\nThe feminine of कुम्भकार or नगरकार will be कुम्भकारी or नगरकारी, in as much as the second member here is _pradhana_ : the word '_kumbha_-_kara_' being formed by अण् (III, 2, 1), and thus making it possible to apply ङीप् by (IV. 1. 15). The affix अण् referred to in the next _sutra_ refers to the _krit_-affix अण् (III. 2. 1), as well as to the _Taddhita_ affix अण् ॥",
    "41015": "The word अतः 'ending in short अ' is understood here by _anuvritti_ from (IV. 1. 4); and qualifies the affixes above-mentioned, wherever necessary. This debars the affix टाप् of (IV. 1. 4). We shall give example of each seriatim (1) Thus, m., कुरुचर f., कुरुचरी m., मद्रचर f, मद्रचरी (चर + ई = चर् + ई; the final अ  is elided by (VI. 4. 148).) The word _kuru_-_chara_ is formed by ट (III. 2. 16). of which ट् is indicatory.\n\nQ. It might be objected, \"why is not the affix ङीप् added after the words पचमान, formed by the affix शानच् (III. 2. 124) in as much as this affix is a substitute of लट्; and because लट् has an indicatory ट्, therefore, its substitute will also be supposed to have an indicatory ट् (I. 1. 57).\"\n\nA. To this we reply, 'the affix लट् is not टित् as it has two indicatory letters, ल् and ट्'.\n\nQ. If that be so, affixes like ल्युट् should also be called no टित् affixes, as they have also two indicatory letters.\n\nA. To this we reply, that if ल्युट् be not regarded टित्, then the indicatory ट् of ल्युट् finds no scope any where: as the indicatory ट् of लट् has its scope in _sutra_ (III. 4. 79). Therefore, the feminine of पचमान will be पचमाना ॥ Similarly, the indicatory ट् of augments will not cause the application of the affix ङीप्; thus पठिता विद्या ॥ Here the feminine of पठिता is formed by आ and not इ. This is indicated by _sutra_ (IV. 3. 23), which says \"augment तुट् is added to the affixes ट्यु and ट्युल्\". If the ट् of तुट् could have made the affix टित् for the purposes of this present _sutra_; the _anubandha_ ट् had been unnecessarily added to the affixes यु and युल् in the above.\n\n(2) Of words ending in ढ we have, m, सौपर्णेय f. सौपर्णेयी so also f. वैनतेयी. The ढ stands for the affix ढक्; and it is replaced by एय् (VII. 1. 2) . Thus सुपर्णा + ढक् (IV. 1. 120)= सुपर्णा + एय = सौपर्णेय (VII. 2. 118). There is no affix which is merely ढ without any indicatory letters; and denoting the feminine; the only affix, as said above, is ढक् ॥ Therefore, the following maxim does not apply here :- \"When a term void of _anubandhas_ (indicatory letters) is imployed in grammar, it does not denote that which has an _anubandha_ attached to it\", and we cannot say that the ड of this _sutra_ refers to the _anubandha_-less ढ of (V. 3. 102) which is always Neuter.\n\n(3) Of words in अण्, we have already said that the affix अण् here refers to both the _Krit_ and the _Taddhita_ affix '_an_'. Thus with the _krit_ affix '_an_' we have कुम्भकार and नगरकार (III. 2. 1), the feminine of which is कुम्भकारी and नगरकारी ॥ With the _Taddhita_ affix '_an_' we have औपगव (IV. 1. 92), the feminine of which is औपगवी ॥ Sometimes words formed by the addition of the affix ण are operated upon as if they were formed by अण् ॥ Thus चौरी, तापसी are the feminine of चौर and तापस (IV. 4. 62), sometimes words formed by ण are not so treated, as दाण्डा, मौष्टा (IV. 2. 57).\n\n(4) Words formed by अञ् as औत्स f. औत्सी, औदपान, f. औदपानी, (IV. 1. 86). Though by (IV. 1. 73) the affix ङीन् would have come after the words ending in अञ्, the re-employment of this affix in the present _sutra_ is for the purpose of preventing the application of the affix ङीष् which would have presented itself by (IV. 1. 63); that is even when '_jati_' is indicated, '_nish_' is not to be employed here.\n\n(5) The three affixes द्वयसच्, दघ्नच् and मात्रच् are added by (V. 2. 37); as, ऊरुद्वयसी, ऊरुदघ्नी, ऊरुमात्री 'reaching to the thigh'. Similarly जानुद्वयसी, जानुदघ्नी, जानुमात्री ।\n\n(6) So also with words formed by तयप् (V. 2. 42). As पञ्चतयी 'of which the parts are five' so also दशतयी ॥\n\n(7) So also with words ending in ठञ् (IV. 4. 1) as, आक्षिकी 'a female dicer', शालाकिकी. The ठ is replaced by इक (VII. 3. 50).\n\n(8) Similarly with words ending in ठञ् (V. 1. 18): as, लावणिकी 'elegant'. The affixes ठक् and ठञ् are separately enumerated in this _sutra_, in order to exclude the affix ठन् &c. For had the word ठ merely been used, then it would have meant all the three affixes ठक्, ठन् and ठञ्, which is not desired.\n\n(9) Similarly with words ending in कञ् (III. 2. 60) as, यादृशी, तादृशी ॥\n\n(10) So also with words ending in क्वरप् (III. 2. 163) as इत्वरी 'swift', नश्वरी ॥\n\nVart:- In addition to the foregoing, there should have been the enumeration of the affixes नञ् and स्नञ् (IV. 1. 87) and ईकक् (IV. 4. 59) and ख्युन् (III. 2. 56) and of the words तरुण and तलुन 'a youth'. Thus स्त्रैणी 'a female', पौंस्नी 'a male', शाक्तीकी 'a female spear bearer', आढ्यंकरणी 'enriching'; तरुणी or तलुनी 'a young woman'.",
    "41016": "Thus गार्ग्य + ङीप् = गार्ग्य + ई (VI. 4. 148) = गार्ग् + ई (VI. 4. 150) = गार्गी 'a female descendant of _Garga_'; so also वात्सी ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies when the affix यञ् denotes a descendant, and not otherwise. Therefore ई will not be applied to form the feminine of द्वैप्य of द्वीप् + यञ् (IV. 3. 10). Its feminine will be द्वैप्या 'a living on or relating to an island'.\n\nThe separation of this _sutra_ from the last, (for the affix यञ् could well have been included in the same), is for the sake of the subsequent aphorisms; in which the _anuvritti_ of यञ् only runs and not of others.",
    "41017": "Of this affix ष्फ the letter ष् is indicatory (I. 3. 6), and shows that the words formed by this affix will take '_nish_' (IV. 1. 41). The feminine nature is here manifested by these two affixes jointly, viz by '_shpha_' and '_nish_'. The object of saying that '_shpha_' is to be regarded as a _taddhita_ affix, is that the word so formed may get the designation of _pratipadika_ (1. 2. 46). The affix फ is replaced by the substitute आयन (VII. 1. 2). Thus गार्ग्य + ष्फ + ङीष् = गार्ग्यायणी; so also वात्स्यायनी ॥ This being an optional rule, we have in the alternative, गार्गी and वात्सी ॥\n\nThe word  सर्वत्र \"every where\", of the next _sutra_ is to be read into this, by a process inverse to that of _anuvritti_, in order to prohibit the application of those rules even which would otherwise debar this. Thus (IV. 1. 75) says:- 'the affix चाप् comes after आवट्य' ॥ Here आवट्य ends in यञ्, and by (IV. 1. 16), the word आवट्य would have taken the affix nip: (IV. 1. 75) debarred this. But according to Eastern Grammarians, here also the affix '_shpha_' will be added. Thus आवट्यायनी ॥",
    "41018": "The words लोहित &c. are a subdivision of _Gargadi_ class ( IV. 1. 105). The present _sutra_ makes the application of the affix ष्फ, compulsory while it was optional in the last. The word कत refers to the independent _pratipadika_ कत in the said subdivision, which follows immediately after the word कपि, and not to the word कुरुकत of the same class, where the word कत is not an independent full nominal-stem but a member only. Thus, लोहित्यायनी, शांशित्यायनी,  बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥\n\n_Karika_ कण्वात्तु शकलः पूर्वः कतादुत्तर इष्यते ॥\nपूर्वोत्तरौ तदन्तादी ष्फाणौ तत्र प्रयोजनम् ॥\n\nFor the purposes of the application of ष्फ and अण्, the word शकल which is enumerated in the _Ganapatha_ after the word कण्व (See (IV. 1. 105)) should be regarded as if it stood immediately before कण्व and after कत ॥ Thus we have शाकल्यायनी (with ष्फ), and शकलाः with अण्, meaning शाकल्यस्येमे छात्राः 'the pupils of _Sakalya_'.",
    "41019": "The word कौरव्य is formed by adding the affix ण्य to the base कुरु (IV. 1. 151); this word, ending in अ, would have formed its feminine by टाप् (IV. 1. 4), but for the present _sutra_. So also by (IV. 1. 119), the word माण्डूक is formed by अण् added to मण्डूक; and the feminine of _manduka_ would have been formed by _nip_ (IV. 1. 15), but for the present aphorism, which supersedes that affix. Thus कौरव्यायणी, माण्डूकायनी ॥\n\nHow do you explain the form कौरवी in the phrase कौरवी सेना ?\n\nWe explain it by saying that कौरवी is not the feminine of कौरव्य; but of कौरव, formed by adding अण् to कुरु by _sutra_ (IV. 3. 120).\n\nVart:- The word आसुरि should be enumerated along with _kauravya_ and _mandukya_. Thus आसुरायणी ॥ The word आसुरि is formed by the affix इञ् added to the word असुर; the word '_asuri_' would, therefore have taken the affix अण्  in forming the further derivative (IV. 2. 112). But according to the opinion of _Patanjali_, the word, '_asuri_' should form its further derivative (called also शैषिक) by taking the affix छ (IV. 2. 114). Thus आसुरीयः कल्पः (तेन प्रोक्तम्) ॥",
    "41020": "The word वयः means the condition of the body as dependent upon time; such as, youth, old age &c. Words expressive of early age form their feminine by ई, though ending in अ ॥ Thus, कुमारी 'a girl'. किशोरी 'a young girl' बर्करी 'a she-kid'.\n\nWhy do we say denoting 'early age?' Observe स्थविरा 'an old woman'; वृद्धा 'an old woman'. Why do we say ending in अ ? Observe शिशु, which is both masculine and feminine.\n\nVart:- The _sutra_ should have been आचरमे वयसि 'words expressive of not old age'? Thus वधूटी 'a young woman', चिरण्टी 'a young woman'. These words denote the second stage of life, and not the first, i. e. they denote women who have attained their maturity.\n\nHow do you explain the form कन्या 'a girl'? This is an exception, and _Panini_ himself uses the word '_kanya_' showing that it is a valid form; as in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 116).\n\nThe words like उत्तानशया 'an infant girl that does not know how to lie down properly' लोहितपादिका 'a female infant whose feet are still tender and red' do not directly, but metaphorically, express age, and hence are not governed by this rule.",
    "41021": "Thus दशपूली, पञ्चपूली ॥ But we find त्रिफला 'the three myrobalans', because this is one of the words spoken of as 'अज &c' (IV. 1. 4).",
    "41022": "This debars 'nip' which otherwise would have presented itself by virtue of the last _sutra_. The words बिस्तः 'a weight of gold equal to 80 _Raktikas_', आचितम् 'a measure of 10 cart-loads or 80,000 _tolahs_'; and कम्बल्यः 'a measure', all denote measure; and are the only words expressing measure to which this rule applies. The word परिमाण means 'measure', as distinguished from संख्या 'a Numeral', See (V. 1. 19), &c.\n\nThus पञ्चाश्व is a _Dvigu_ compound, meaning 'purchased for five horses.' Here the _Taddhita_ affix ठञ् (V. 1. 37) giving the sense of 'purchased with' has been elided by (V. 1. 28). This compound does not end in a word denoting _parimana_ techincally so called or a measure. The feminine of this word will not be formed by ङीप् but by टाप्, thus, पञ्चश्वा 'a female purchased for five horses'.\n\nThe words denoting 'time' or 'number' are not words denoting 'measure' as understood in this _sutra_ by the word '_parimana_'. Thus, द्विवर्षा, 'a two years old female child', त्रिवर्षा 'a three years old female child' (V. 2. 37 _Vart_.) So also द्विशता 'a female purchased for two hundreds', similarly त्रिशता ॥ So also with the words बिस्त &c. As द्विबिस्ता 'purchased for two _bistas_', त्रिबिस्ता, द्व्याचिता, त्र्याचिता, द्विकम्बल्या, and त्रिकम्बल्या, &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'not ending in a word denoting a _Parimana_ or a 'measure'? Observe द्व्याढकी, त्र्याढकी \"a female purchased for two or three _adhaka_\". Here _adhaka_ means a measure equal to 7 Ib. II oz. avoir.\n\nWhy do we say 'when a _Taddhita_ affix is elided'? In '_Samahara_ _Dvigu_' compounds, the affix '_nip_' will apply. Thus पञ्चाश्वी 'an aggregate of five horses', so also दशाश्वी ॥",
    "41023": "Thus द्विकाण्डा क्षेत्रभक्तिः 'a division of a field of the measure of two _kandas_.' Here, the word द्विकाण्ड is a _Dvigu_ compound ending in '_kanda_'; the _Taddhita_ affixes denoting measure enjoined by (V. 2. 37), have been elided by the _vartika_ 'प्रमाणे लो द्विगोर्नित्यम्' given under the same _sutra_. The feminine, therefore, of this word will not be formed by '_nip_' but by टाप्; so also त्रिकाण्डा क्षेत्रभक्तिः ॥\n\nThe term '_kanda_' is a word expressive of non-measure; and, therefore, the prohibition contained in the last _sutra_ applies to it; the present _sutra_ is made to regulate this prohibition. That is to say, the prohibition contained in the last _sutra_ is not universally applicable in the case of _Dvigu_ compounds ending in '_kanda_'; it applies to cases where the compound refers to superficial land measure. Therefore we have, द्विकाण्डी रज्जुः 'a rope two _kandas_ long'; त्रिकाण्डी रज्जुः 'a rope three _kandas_ long'.",
    "41024": "Thus द्विपुरुषा or द्विपुरुषी परिखा 'a mote two _purusha_ wide' so also त्रिपुरुषी or त्रिपुरुषा &c. The present _sutra_ ordains an option where (IV. 1. 22) would have made the prohibition universal. Why do we say 'when referring to measure'? Observe द्विपुरुषा 'a female purchased in exchange for two males'; No option is allowed here. Where the _Taddhita_ affix is not elided, the present rule does not apply. Therefore in _Samahara_ _Dvigu_ we have द्विपुरुषी or  त्रिपुरुषी ॥",
    "41025": "Thus the _Bahuvrihi_ compound of कुण्ड 'a bowl' and ऊधस् will be कुण्डोधस्; then the final of _udhas_ is replaced by the substitute अनङ् (V. 4. 131); thus we have कुण्डोधन्; which would have been liable to the rules (IV. 1. 12), (IV. 1. 13.) _ante_ ; the present ¬_sutra_ enjoins ङीष् instead. Thus कुण्डोध्नी (VI. 4. 134) 'a woman with full bosom'; घटोध्नी 'a cow with udders like jars'.\n\nWhy do we say 'after a _Bahuvrihi_ compound'? Observe प्राप्ता ऊधः = प्राप्तोधाः (II. 2. 4) which is a _Tatpurusha_ compound.\n\nThe _Sutra_ (IV. 1. 28) also is debarred in this case: for though the penultimate अ is elided by the (VI. 4. 134), yet rule (IV. 1. 28) does not apply here.\n\nThe substitution of अन् for the final of ऊधस् takes place only then, when the feminine nature is to be expressed and not otherwise. Therefore in the masculine we have महोधा पर्जन्यः 'the big-bosomed cloud'.",
    "41026": "This _sutra_ ordains '_nip_', where by the last _sutra_ there would have been '_nish_'. Thus द्वी + ऊधस् + अनङ् + ङीप् (V. 4. 131) = द्व्यूध्नी 'having two udders'; so also त्र्यूध्नी, 'having three udders'. The above are _Bahuvrihi_ compounds beginning with a Numeral. Similarly अत्यूध्नी 'many-uddered.; निरूध्नी 'having no udders'.\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with'? So that the rule may apply to compounds like द्विविधोध्नी and त्रिविधोध्नी, in which the words '_dvividha_' and '_trividha_', though not _Sankhya_ are words which begin with a _Sankhya_.",
    "41027": "The word दामन् was liable to be operated upon by three rules, by, (IV. 1. 13) ordaining डाप्, by (IV. 1. 11) prohibiting totally the affixing of ङीप् and (IV. 1. 28) ordaining _nip_ optionally : the present _sutra_ ordains _nip_ to the exclusion of all those rules. As द्विदाम्नी 'a (mare) bound by two ropes'. त्रिदाम्नी ॥\n\nSimilarly हायन would have taken long आ by (IV. 1. 4), this ordains long ई ॥ Thus द्विहायनी 'two years (old girl)', त्रिहायणी; चतुर्हायणी ॥  \n\nVart:- The word '_hayana_' must denote 'age', for the purposes of this _sutra_. Therefore we have no _nip_ here:-  द्विहायना शाला 'a hall of two years existence'. So also त्रिहायना and चतुर्हायना ॥ Moreover in these latter cases the न is not changed into ण; for when हायन denotes 'age', it is then only that the न is changed into ण and not otherwise.",
    "41028": "Thus बहुराजन् is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound ending in अन्; in applying _nip_, it loses is penultimate by (VI. 4. 134) (अल्लोपोऽनः there is elision of अ of अन् when a _bha_ affix follows). Thus बहुराज्ञी 'having many kings'. In the alternative, when _nip_ is not added, we may add the affix डाप् by (IV. 1. 13). Thus बहुराजा, बहुराजे, बहुराजाः ॥ Or we may apply the prohibition contained in (IV. I. 12) and have बहुराजा, बहुराजानौ, बहुराजानः ॥ when the penultimate is not elided we cannot apply the affix ङीप् at all : in cases of such compounds there are only two forms of the feminine noun as सुपर्वा, सुपर्वे, सुपर्वाः or सुपर्वा सुपर्वाणौ, सुपर्वाणः ॥ That is to say we apply (IV. 1. 13) and (IV. 1. 12) only; for in the case of सुपर्वन् &c. rule (VI. 4. 137) prevents the elision of the penultimate न्; (न संयोगाद्वमनन्तात्, there is not elision of the अ of अन् when it comes after a conjunct consonant ending in व or म)॥",
    "41029": "This is an exception to the last rule; for while that enjoined the optional, the present enjoins the compulsory application of the affix ङीप् ॥ Thus सुराज्ञी 'the city called _Surajni_'; अतिराज्ञी 'the city of _Atirajni_'. Similarly in the _Chhandas_ we have गौः पञ्चदाम्नी, एकदाम्नी, द्विदाम्नी 'a cow having five udders, one udder, or three udders'. एकमूर्ध्रा समानमूर्ध्री ॥",
    "41030": "The phrase संज्ञा छन्दसोः of the last _sutra_ is understood here also. Thus केवली in the _Chhandas_, as opposed to केवला in the ordinary language, when not denoting a Name; so also मामकी and मामिका; भागधेयी as मित्रावरुणयोर्भागधेयी and भागधेया; पापी and पापा; अपरी as उताऽपरीभ्योमघवा विजिग्ये; (_Rigveda_. I. 1. 13) and अपरा; समानी प्रवाणी and समाना; आर्यकृती and आर्यकृता्; सुमङ्गली (_Rigveda_ X. 85. 33) सुमङ्गला; भेषजी and भेषजा ॥ सुमङ्गल takes ङीष् also by (IV. 1. 41), as belonging to _Gauradi_ class No. 86.",
    "41031": "Thus या रात्री सृष्टा, रात्रीभिः (3rd pl); (_Rigveda_ X. 127. I. I. 35. 1) but in the nominative plural we have रात्रयः, the regular plural of the word रात्रि, as in the sentence यास्ता रात्रयः, instead of रात्र्यः ॥\n\nVart:- According to _Katyayana_, _nip_ is not added, not only when we apply the nominative plural termination जस्; but in all other terminations beginning with जस् also. Thus रात्रिं सहोषित्वा; here in the accusative singular case also the ङीप् is not employed.\n\nBut how do you explain the form रात्र्यः in the following तिमिरपटलैरवगुण्ठिताश्च रात्र्यः; This '_ratrya_' is the nominative plural of '_ratri_' which is formed by the feminine affix _nip_; and not by _nish_. The forms evolved by adding ङीष् or ङीप् are one and the same, except with regard to accent; that formed by _nish_ has _udatta_ accent on the final: the other has it on the initial. The word रात्रि is formed by the _krit_ affix त्रिप् (_Un_. IV. 67), and therefore, it is a word which is governed by (IV. 1. 45) because it is a word falling in _Bahuvadi_ class, by virtue of the general subrule \"a word ending with the vowel इ of a _krit_ affix, other than क्तिन् belongs to _Bahuvadi_ class; some say that every word ending in इ, if it has not the force of the affix क्तिन् belongs to this class\". Therefore it takes ङीष् in forming the feminine.",
    "41032": "This _sutra_ points out the base and teaches the addition of the augment नुक् ॥ When this augment is added, (and it must be added at the end, by _sutra_ (I. 1. 46)), the forms become अन्तर्वत्न् and परिवत्न्; and these words must take _nip_ by virtue of (IV. 1. 5), if not by this _sutra_. Thus we have अन्तर्वत्नी and पतिवत्नी ॥ This irregular formation of the feminine is employed only then, when the sense of the words so formed is 'a pregnant female' and 'one whose husband is living' respectively. Therefore we have not the above forms in the following:- प्रथते त्वया पतिमती पृथिवी; here the word पतिमती qualifies the word पृथिवी and has not the sense of 'having the husband living', therefore its formation is regular. Similarly when the sense is not of 'a pregnant female', the feminine will not be अन्तर्वत्नी; in fact there will be no affixing of वत् (मतुप्). Because मतुप् is added to words possessing certain attribute, as described in (V. 2. 94), while the word अन्तर् has the sense of location, and can never be in apposition with the sense of अस्ति \"having\" as required by (V. 2. 94) The word अन्तर् would not therefore take मतुप् ॥ It does so irregularly by this _sutra_. The म is changed to व by (VIII. 2. 9) in अन्तर्वत् ॥ The change of म to व in पतिवत् is however irregular.\n\nThe augment नुक् is optionally added to these words in the Vedas:- as सान्तर्वत्नी or सान्तर्वती देवानुपैत् ॥ पतिवत्नी or पतिवती तरुणवत्सा ॥",
    "41033": "Thus पत्नि वाचं यच्छ ॥ The feminine पत्नी means legitimate wife, she who is entitled to take part in the sacrifices of her husband. The word यज्ञसंयोग is an Instrumental _Tatpurusha_ compound and means \"related through sacrifice\" i. e who shares the fruits of and is entitled to participate in, the sacrifices of her husband. But when the sense is not that of 'wife', the feminine of पति will be पति as ग्रामस्य पतिरियं ब्राह्मणी 'this _Brahmani_ is the head or mistress of this village'. If the word पत्नी means 'the wife who takes part in the sacrifices of her husband', it cannot be applied to the wife of a _Sudra_, for a _Sudra_ cannot perform a sacrifice, a fortiori not his wife? The term पत्नी is, however, extended to the wife of a _Sudra_ also, by analogy, as the marriage of a _Sudra_ also takes place by offering sacrifice to Fire and making it a witness.",
    "41034": "The word सपूर्वस्य means when the word पति is not an _upasarjana_, but stands at the end of a compound. Thus वृद्धपतिः or वृद्धपत्नी; स्थूलपतिः or स्थूलपत्नी ॥ This is an example of _aprapta_-_vibhasha_. Because it is free from the limitations of '_yajna_-_sanyoga_' of the last _sutra_. Why do we say when it is preceded by another word? Observe पतिरियं ब्राह्मणी ग्रामस्य, this _Brahman_ lady is the mistress of the village.' Here the feminine is पति and not पत्नी ॥",
    "41035": "This enjoins the necessary and not optional substitution of न् for the final इ of पति, before the affix ङीप्, in the cases of certain words. The word '_nitya_' is used in the aphorism for the sake of precision. Thus सपत्नी, एकपत्नी ॥ The compound of the following words with पत्नी are governed by this rule:- 1 समान 'equal' 2 एक 'one', 3 वीर 'hero', 4 पिण्ड 'a cake', 5 भ्रातृ 'brother' 6 पुत्र 'a son', and 7 दास 'a slave' (this only in the _Chhandas_).",
    "41036": "Thus पूतक्रतायी 'the wife of _Putakratu_'. This and the two succeeding _sutras_, are in a way more intimately connected with (IV. 1. 48), in as much as the sense of the feminine words must be that of 'wife of', otherwise these _sutras_ will not apply. Thus if the meaning is not that of 'wife of', the word पूतक्रतुः will be both masculine and feminine as well, meaning 'she by whom sacrifices (क्रतवः) are sanctified (पूताः)'.",
    "41037": "The words वृषाकपि and कुसीद have _udatta_ accent on the middle vowel (_Phit_ _Su_ II. 19), the feminine of these has _udatta_, however, on the final. The words '_agni_' and the rest have the _udatta_ on the final (_Phit_ _su_ 1. 1), their substitute ऐ will necessarily be _udatta_, by the rule of _sthanivat_ _bhava_, even if the present _sutra_ had not explicitly declared it to be so. Thus वृषाकपायी (_Rig_ _Veda_ X. 86. 13) 'the wife of _Vrishakapi_', अग्नायी, (_Rig_ _Ved_. I. 22. 12) the wife of '_Agni_', कुसितायी 'wife of _Kusita_', कुसिदायी 'the wife of _Kusidai_'. The present rule only applies when the sense of the feminine word is that of 'wife of'. Otherwise we have वृषाकपिः स्त्री 'the women _Vrishakapi_' and not वृषाकपायी ॥ For the accent of the word वृष, See (VI. 1. 203).",
    "41038": "The phrases ऐ and उदात्त are understood. The force of वा is to make the substitution optional. Thus we have three forms, मनायी or मनावी or मनुः, all meaning 'the wife of _Manu_'. The word मनु has _udatta_ accent on the first vowel, as it is formed from मन् by the affix उ (_Un_ l. 10), which by _Un_ I. 9 is treated as having an indicatory म्, and affixes having indicatory न् throw the accent on the first syllable. (VI. I. 197)",
    "41039": "Thus of एत 'variegated'; the feminine is एता or एनी 'variegated', so श्येता or श्येनी 'black', हरिता or हरिणी 'green'. All these words have _udatta_ accent on the first vowel either by Rule (VI. 1. 197) (ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् \"word formed by affixes having an indicatory ञ् or न् have _udatta_ accent on the first vowel\":) because these words are formed by the _Unadi_ affixes तन् (_Un_ III. 86) and इतन् (III. 93), or by the _Phit_ _sutra_ 11. 10 (वर्णानां तणतिनितान्तानाम् \"of words expressive of colour and ending in तण, or ति or नि or त, the _udatta_ accent falls on the first vowel\").\n\nWhy do we say \"expressive of color\"? Observe प्रहृता, प्ररुता ॥ These words are also acutely accented on the first syllable, by rule (VI. 2. 49) (गतिरनन्तरः \"the first word retains its natural accent in a compound of a _gati_ word with a word formed by the affix _kta_\"). But as these words do not express color, their feminine does not take _nip_.\n\nWhy do we say \"ending in a gravely accented vowel?\" Observe श्वेता 'white'. Here though the word expresses 'color', yet it has acute (instead of grave) accent on the final (by rule of _Phit_ _sutra_ I. 21 घृतादीनां च \"the words _ghrita_ &c. have _udatta_ on the final\").\n\nWhy do we say \"having the letter त as its penultimate letter\"?  Otherwise the affix _nish_ will be employed in forming the feminine.\n\nThe words for the application of this rule must end in the letter अ in the masculine. Otherwise this rule will not apply. As शितिर्ब्राह्मणी 'a black _Brahmani_ woman'. Here शिति is a word expressive of color, it has a penultimate त, has _anudatta_ accent on the final (VI. 1. 197) as it is formed by the affix क्तिन्; but as it does not end with अ, its feminine is not formed with _nip_.\n\nVart:- The affix _hip_ comes also after the word पिशङ्ग; as, पिशङ्गी 'of tawny color'.\n\nVart:- There is prohibition in the case of the words असित and पलित; as असिता 'black' and पलिता 'grey'.\n\nVart:- According to some, the substitute क्नम् replaces the final of these two words असित and पलिता in the Vedic literature. As आसिक्नी (_Rig_ _Veda_ IX. 73. 29); पलिक्नी (_R_. _Veda_ V. 2. 4). According to some authorities, these latter forms are valid in literature other than the Vedic:- As गतो गणस्तूर्णमसिक्निकानाम् ॥",
    "41040": "The word वा of (IV. 1. 38) does not govern this _sutra_. The word अन्यतः means in other cases than those governed by the last aphorism i.e. after words which have not त as penultimate. The difference between _nip_ and _nish_ affixes consists in accent, the former being gravely accented (111. 1. 4) and the latter acute. Thus सारङ्गी, कल्माषी, शबली ॥\n\nWhen the word does not express color, this rule does not apply. As खट्वा 'a bed-sted'.\n\nWhen the word does not end with a gravely accented vowel, this will not apply, as, कृष्णा , कपिला ॥",
    "41041": "Thus by _Sutra_ (III. 1. 145) (शिल्पिनि ष्वुन्) the affix ष्वुन् is added to a root, to form noun of agency, denoting an artist. The feminine of the words so formed, will take _nish_. As, नर्तकी 'an actress', खनकी 'a digger'; रजकी 'a dyer'. So also the words गौर & c; as गौरी, मत्सी । The following is the list of words belonging to _Gauradi_ class. \n\n1 गौर, 2 मत्स्य, 3 मनुष्य, 4 शृङ्ग, 5 पिङ्गल 6 हय, 7 गवय, 8 मुकय, 9 ॠष्य, 10 पुट, 11 तूण 12 द्रुण, 13 द्रोण; 14 हरिण, 15 कोकण, (काकण,) 16 पटर, 17 उकण, (आमल) 18 आमलक, 19 कुवल, 20 बिम्ब, 21 बदर, 22 फर्करक (कर्कर) 23 तर्कार, 24 शर्कार, 25 पुष्कर 26 शिखण्ड, 27 सलद 28 शष्कण्ड 29 सनन्द 30 सुषम, 31 सुषव 32 अलिन्द 33 गडुज, 34 पाण्डश 35 आढक, 36 आनन्द, 37 आश्वत्थ 38 सृपाट, 39 आखक (आपच्चिक), 40 शष्कुल, 41 सूर्य (सूर्म) 42 शूर्प, 43 सूच, 44 यूष (पूष) 45 यूथ, 46 सूप, 47 मेथ, 48 वल्लक, 49 घातक, 50 सल्लक, 51 मालक, 52 मालत, 53 साल्वक; 54 वेतस, 55 वृक्ष (वृस) 56 अतस, 57 उभय 58 भृङ्ग, 59 मह, 60 मठ, 61 छेद, 62 पेश, 63 मेद, 64 श्वन्, 65 तक्षन्, 66 अनडुही, 67 अनड्वाही, 68 । एषणः करणे । 69 देह, 70 देहल, 71 काकादन 72 गवादन, 73 तेजन, 74 रजन, 75 लवण, 76 औदाहमानि (औद्गाहमानि) 77 गौतम (गोतम) 78 पारक, 79 अयस्थूण (अथःस्थूण) 80 भौरिकि, 81 भौलिकि, 82 भौलिङ्गि 83 यान 84 मेध, 85 आलम्बि, 86 आलजि, 87 आलब्धि, 88 आलक्षि, 89 केवाल, 90 आपक. 91 आरट, 92 नट, 93 टोट, 94 नोट, 95 मूलाट, 96 शातन, 97 पोतन, 98 पातन, 99 पाठन (पानट) 100 आस्तरण, 101 अधिकरण, 102 अधिकार 103 अग्रहायणी (आग्रहायणी) 104 प्रत्यवरोहिणी 105 सेचन, 106 सुमङ्गलात्संज्ञायाम् । 107 अण्डर 108 सुन्दर, 109 मण्डल, 110 मन्थर, 111 मंगल 112 पट, 113 पिण्ड, 114 षण्ड, 115 ऊर्ध, 116 गुर्द, 117 शम, 118 सूद, 119 औड (आर्द) 120 हद (ह्द) 121 पाण्ड, 122 भाण्डल (भाण्ड) 123 लोहाण्ड, 124 कदर, 125 कन्दर, 126 करल, 127 तरुण, 128 तलुन, 129 कल्माष, 130 बृहत्, 131 महत्, 132 सोम, 133 सौधर्म । 134 रोहिणी नक्षत्रे । 135 रेवती नक्षत्रे । 136 विकल, 137 निष्कल 138 पुष्कल । 139 कटाच्छ्रोणिवचने । पिप्पल्यादयश्च । 140 पिप्पली, 141 हरितकी (हरीतकी) 142 कोशातकी, 143 शमी, 144 वरी, 145 शरी, 146 पृथिवी, 147 क्रोष्टु, 148 मातामह, 149 पितामह, 150 सुगेढ, 151 सुब, 152 सूर्य, 153 सकलूक, 154 आलिंगि, 155 पावन, 156 एत, 157 विटक, 158 भट्ट, 159 दहन, 160 कन्द, 181 कण ॥\n\nN.B.- The word गौर though denoting color, is finally acute by virtue of this _sutra_; the word मत्स &c. being _jati_ words having a penultimate य would not have taken _nip_ (IV. 1. 63) but for this _sutra_; श्वन् and तक्षन् would have taken डाप् (IV. 1. 13), एषण is formed by ल्युट् and would have taken _nip_ (IV. 1. 15) इष्यतेऽनया = एषणी 'a balance, a probe'. गौतम would take _nin_ also by (IV. 1. 73). Similarly it may be shown why the several words have been included in this list. By the _vartika_ मातरि षिच्च given under (IV. 2. 36), the affix आमह in मातामह is treated as having an indicatory ष ॥ The word मातामह will take ङीष् because it is षित्; its inclusion in the list of _Gauradi_ indicates that the rule of ङीष् application, because a word is षित्, is not universal (अनित्यः षिल् लक्षणो ङीष्) ॥ Therefore we have forms like दंष्ट्रा &c.",
    "41042": "Thus जानपदी 'a profession', otherwise जानपदी, the difference being in accent only. For this word is formed by adding the affix अञ् to _janapada_, by _sutra_ (IV. 1. 86), as it belongs to _Utsadi_ class of words: in forming the feminine the affix ङीप् will be added in this latter case, thus throwing the acute accent on the first syllable.\n \n(2) So also कुण्डी 'bowl-shaped vessel', otherwise कुण्डा 'a name of _Durga_'. (3) गोणी 'a sack' यत्र धान्यादि प्रक्षिप्य नीयते otherwise गोणा, a particular name. (4) स्थली 'a place not prepared by artificial improvement'; otherwise स्थला as स्थलयोदकं परिगृह्णन्ति ॥ (5) भीजा 'cooked', otherwise भाजा, (6) नागा 'a stout woman', otherwise नागा ॥ The word नाग when a _guna_-_vachana_ word i.e a word expressive of quality, in the sense of 'stoutness', takes the affix _nish_ in the feminine; otherwise टाप् when expressing general qualities. When it is a _jati_-_vachana_ word it takes ङीप् under all circumstances. (7) काली 'a black-coloured female', otherwise काला 'cruel' (8) नीली 'a blue-coloured animal or indigo' The word अनाच्छादन in the _sutra_ is rather too wide, it should be confined to the two senses above indicated i. e. when it applies to a plant called indigo or to animals'. Such as नालागौः, or नीली वडवा; or when it denotes appellative as नीली ॥ In other cases we have नीला 'a blue-coloured cloth'. (9) कुशी 'a plough share', otherwise कुशा 'a rope or a kind of grass' (10) कामुकी 'a libidinous or lustful woman' otherwise कामुका 'a woman desirous of wealth'. (11) कबरी 'a fillet or braid of hair', otherwise कबरा 'mixed, variegated'.",
    "41043": "Thus शोणी or शोणा वडवा 'a red or bay mare'. By _Phit_ _Sutra_ II. 10 referred to already in (IV. 1. 39) the _udatta_ in शोणा falls on the first syllable, and by (IV. 1. 40) it would have taken ङीष् always; but the present _sutra_ makes a _niyama_ rule and restricts the application of ङीष् according to the opinion of Eastern Grammarians only, and not of others.",
    "41044": "The word गुणवचनः means what expresses quality: i.e. \"words not being words formed by primitive or secondary affixes, or other words entitled to the name of _sankhya_ or _sarvanaman_, or _jati_, or compound words, provided they are words denoting qualities and capable of being used as adjectives qualifying substantives as the word शुक्ल is, not as the word रूप, which though it expresses a quality, cannot be used as an adjective.\" (Guide to _Panini_). Thus from पटु 'dexterous', we have पट्वी or पटुः (without a feminine affix); so मृदुः or मृद्वी 'soft'. Why do we say 'ending in a short उ'? Observe शुचिरियं ब्राह्मणी 'this _Brahmana_ lady is pure'. Why do we say \"expressive of a quality? \" Observe आखुः 'a mouse' (both masculine and feminine).\n\nVart:- After the word वसु when expressive of a quality, the affix _nip_ is employed in the feminine; in order to make the first syllable acutely accented. As, वस्वी ॥ वसु is formed by उ (_Vn_. I. 10) and is _adyudatta_ because the उ is नित् ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated after the word खरु, and words though ending in short उ, have conjunct consonant as penultimate. As खरुरियं ब्राह्मणी 'a _Brahmani_ who chooses her own husband'. Similarly पाण्डु is both gender, as ण्ड् is a conjunct consonant. As पाण्डुरियं ब्राह्मणी ॥\n\nThe word _Guna_ गुणः 'quality' has been thus defined:-\n\nसत्वे निविशतेपैति पृथग् जातिषु दृश्यते ।\nआधेयश्चाक्रियाजश्च सोऽसत्त्वप्रकृतिर्गुणः ॥",
    "41045": "As बहुः or बह्वी ॥ The following are the words belonging to the _Bahvadi_ class–\n\n1 बहु, 2 पद्धति, 3 अञ्चति, 4 अङ्कति, 5 अंहति, 6 शकटि, (शकति), 7 शक्तिः शस्त्रे, 8 शारि, 9 वारि, 10 राति 11 राधि, 12 शाधि, 13 अहि, 14 कपि, 15 यष्टि, 16 मुनि, 17 इतः प्राप्यंगात् । 18 कृदिकारादक्तिनः। 19 सर्वतोऽक्तिन्नर्थादित्येके। 20 चण्ड, 21 अराल, 22 कृपण, 23 कमल, 24 विकट, 25 विशाल, 26 विशङ्कट, 27 भरुज, 28 ध्वज, 29 चन्द्रभागान्नद्याम् (चन्द्रभागा नद्याम्) 30 कल्याण, 31 उदार, 32 पुराण, 33 अहन्, 34 क्रोड, 35 नख, 36 खुर, 37 शिखा, 38 बाल, 39 शफ, 40 गुद ॥ आकृतिगणोऽयम् ॥ तेन । 43 भग, 44 गल, 45 राग इत्यादि ॥\n\nThe affix _nish_ also comes optionally after words ending in short इ being the names of the limbs of animals; as, धमनिः or धमनी ॥ So also after the vowel इ of a _krit_ affix, not क्तिन् (III. 3. 94), as रात्रि or रात्री ॥ Some say that the feminine affix _nish_ may come after any word ending in इ, if it has not the force of the affix क्तिन् ॥ The word बहु is a _guna_-word and would have optionally taken _nish_ even by the last _sutra_, its specification here is for the subsequent _sutra_, by which it necessarily takes _nish_ in the _Chhandas_. It is an _Akritigana_",
    "41046": "Thus बह्वीषु हित्वा प्रपिवन् ॥ Here बह्वी is the name of a herb.\n\nThe word नित्य 'always' is used in the aphorism, more for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, which it governs than for this _sutra_. For the word 'optionally' does not govern this, and the aphorism even without the word '_nitya_'? would have been a necessary rule and not optional: for आरम्भसामर्थ्यादेव नित्योविधिः सिद्धः, योगारम्भश्चिन्त्य योजनः ॥",
    "41047": "Thus विभ्वी, प्रभ्वी, सुभ्वी, शम्भ्वी ॥\n\nBut why not so in the case of स्वयभूः? Because it ends in long ऊ, while विभ्वी &c. are feminine of विभु &c. ending in short उ ॥ In fact the word उतः \"after a word ending in short उ\" of _Sutra_ (IV. 1. 44) governs this also. The word भुवः is the ablative case of भु irregularly formed by the substitution of उवङ्; this form being confined to _sutras_ only.",
    "41048": "Relation (_yoga_) with a male (_punsa_) is called पुंयोग ॥ Thus the wife of गणक 'an astrologer' is called गणकी, so also महामात्री 'the wife of a chief minister', प्रष्ठी 'the wife of a chief'; प्रचरी &c. Thus the word गणक means an astrologer, a calculator or a mathematician; and the wife of such a person will be expressed by the word गणकी ॥ But if a woman is herself an astrologer &c, she will be called गणका ॥ (by टाप्) &c. Therefore when matrimonial relation is not denoted, this _sutra_ will not apply.\n\nWhy do we say 'in relation to a husband'? Observe देवदत्ता यज्ञदत्ता 'two women of the names of _Devadatta_, and _Yajnadatta_, not wives of _Devadatta_ and _Yajnadatta_.'\n\nWhy do we say \"आख्या or a name\"? The word formed will be the name of a woman whose husband is possessed of the quality denoted by the word, and not that the woman possesses that quality. In the case of a woman, therefore, the word is merely a Name or a Designation, and has no reference to the etymological meaning of the word. Moreover, the omission of the word आख्यायाम् would have made the _sutra_ ambiguous, for the phrase  पुं योगाद् also means 'an effect produced by union with a man' such as pregnancy. And words परिसृष्टा and प्रजाता would have required ई and not आ ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of words like गोपालिक and the rest. Thus गोपालिका 'the wife of a cow-herd'.\n\nVart: The affix चाप् comes after सूर्य in denoting the wife of _Surya_, when she is a celestial being. As सूर्या 'the celestial wife of the god _Surya_', while सूरी will denote a human wife of _Surya_, such as, _Kunti_ &c. The affix चाप् makes the word acutely accented on the final: for the word सूर्य has acute on the initial, and had ङीष् been only prohibited and no specific affix ordained, then टाप् would have applied, and it would have left the accent unchanged. Hence a distinct affix चाप् is ordained.",
    "41049": "The augment आनुक् is added to the Proper Nouns इन्द्र, वरुण, भव, शर्व, रुद्र, and मृड, and to the words हिम 'snow', अरण्य 'a forest', यव 'barley', यवन 'a _Yavana_', मातुल 'a maternal uncle', and आचार्य 'a preceptor', before the feminine affix ङीष् ॥\n\nThe present _sutra_ teaches two things, the addition of the augment आनुक् (आन्) and secondly the feminine affix ङीष् ॥ Out of the above words, in case of those about which matrimonial relation is desired to be expressed, i. e. the Proper Nouns up to मृड, the present _sutra_ teaches only the addition of the augment आनुक्, for in their case, the affix ङीष् would follow by force of the preceding _Sutra_. In the case of the remaining words, it teaches both these things.\nThus इन्द्राणी 'the wife of _Indra_', वरुणानी 'the wife of _Varuna_',  भवानी 'the wife of _Bhava_', शर्वाणी 'the wife of _Sarva_', रुद्राणी 'the wife of _Rudra_', मृडानि 'the wife of _Mrida_'.\n\nVart:- Of the words हिम and अरण्य, there is the augment अनुक् in the sense of greatness. Thu हिमानी 'a glacier, much snow', अरण्यानी 'a great forest'. Otherwise these words are always Neuter and never take feminine·\n\nVart:- After the word यव 'barley' the feminine affix and the augment are added in the sense of fault. The fault consists in its imitating barley while not being a barley. In fact the word denotes a new and inferior sort of grain. Thus यवानी \"a kind of grain, oat\".\n\nVart:- After the word यवन, the affix and the augment are added in the sense of handwriting. Thus यवनानी 'the written character of the _Yavanas_'.\n\nVart:- Of the words मातुल 'a maternal uncle', and उपाध्याय 'a preceptor', when the feminine affix comes to express the wife thereof, the augment आनुक् is optional. Thus मतुलानी or मातुली 'the wife of a maternal uncle' उपाध्यायानी or उपाध्यायी 'the wife of a preceptor'.\n\nVart:- And there is not the change to the lingual ण् of the dental न् of the augment आनुक् (VIII. 4. 2) after the word आचार्य ॥ Thus आचार्यानी or आचार्या 'the wife of a preceptor'.\n\nVart:- After the words अर्य and क्षत्रिय this rule applies optionally : when the matrimonial relation is not intended but the word retains its own sense. Thus अर्याणी or अर्या 'the female of the _Arya_ or _Vaishya_ class', क्षत्रियाणी or क्षत्रिया 'a female of the _Kshatriya_ class'. When matrimonial relation is to be expressed, then only ङीष् is added. As अर्यी 'the wife of a _Vaishya_', क्षत्रियी 'the wife of a _Kshatriya_'.\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_, the affix ङीष् with the augment आनुक् is added to the word मुद्गल; and the affix is treated as if it had an indicatory ल् ॥ The force of the indicatory ल् is to make the vowel preceding the affix, take the acute accent (VI. 1. 193 लिति). Thus रथीरभून् मुद्गलानी गविष्टौ ॥ (_Rig_ _Veda_ X. 102. 2).",
    "41050": "The word करणपूर्वम् means that compound in which the करण or 'means' is the first member. Thus वस्त्रक्रीती 'a female bought in exchange for cloth'; so also वसनक्रीती 'a female bought in exchange for dress'.\n\nWhy do we say \"when the first member of the compound is the name of the means\" ? Observe सुक्रीता 'well purchased', दुष्क्रीता 'ill-purchased'. But why is not the affix ङीष् employed in धनक्रीता in the following verse :-- सा हितस्यधनक्रीता प्राणेभ्योपि गरीयसी 'she purchased in exchange of riches is more dear to him than life'. Here the word क्रीत has first taken the affix टाप् forming क्रीता and then this feminine word is compounded with धन ॥ The general rule is गतिकारकोपपदानां कृद्भिः सहसमासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः \"_Gati_, _Karakas_ and _Upapadas_ are compounded with bases that end with _Krit_-affixes, before a case termination or a feminine affix has been added to the latter\". The word धनक्रीता is an exception, founded on the diversity allowed by कर्तृकरणे कृता बहुलम् (II. 1. 32).",
    "41051": "The word करण पूर्वात् 'preceded by a noun denoting the means where with', of the last _sutra_ governs this also. The participle in क्त, must be preceded by a noun in the instrumental case, and the sense conveyed by क्त, to the action should give the sense of 'little', in connection therewith. The अल्पाख्यायाम् of the _sutra_ qualifies the whole word. Thus अभ्रविलिप्ती द्यौः 'a sky covered slightly with clouds', सूपविलिप्ती पात्री 'a dish slightly covered with soup'.\n\nWhy do we say when the sense is that of 'little'? Observe चन्दनानुलिप्ता ब्राह्मणी \"a _Brahmani_ lady covered with sandal essence?\"",
    "41052": "The word क्तात् of the last aphorism governs this also. This _sutra_ applies to those _Bahuvrihi_ compounds in which the first member is a _svanga_ word. But if the antecedent member is not a _svanga word_, then the application of the rule is optional. As शंखभिन्नी 'having a rent on the temporal bone', ऊरुभिन्नी 'having a rent on the thigh'. गलकोत्कृन्नी (गलमुत्कृत्तमस्या), केशलूनी ॥ By (II. 2. 36) _ Vart _ जातिकालसुखादिश्यः परवचनम्, the _Nishtha_ stands in the second place, otherwise by (II. 2. 36) it ought to have formed the first member of the compound. The words शंख &c. are _jati_ words, and by (VI. 2. 170), the acute is on the final.\n\nWhy do we say \"after a _Bahuvrihi_ compound ?\" Observe पादपतिता which is an Ablative _Tatpurusha_ compound (II. 2. 38). The compounding is by (II. 1. 32), and it has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 144).\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the participle जात 'born', which is also acutely accented on the final. Thus दन्तजाता 'a female who has cut her teeth;' स्तनजाता 'a female whose breast has been developed'. See (II. 2. 36) _Vart_.\n\nVart:- In the case of words पाणिगृहीती &c, the affix is employed in certain senses only. Thus पाणिगृहीती 'a wife'; (अग्निसाक्षिकं यस्याः पाणिर्गृह्यते); but पाणिगृहीता 'a woman whose hands have been taken, but not before the sacred fire, a concubine &c.'\n\nVart:- Exception must be stated in the case of compounds, the antecedent member of which is any one of the following words :- बहु, नञ, सु, words denoting time, सुख &c. Thus बहुकृता, अकृता, सुकृता, मासजाता, संवत्सरजाता, सुखजाता or दुःखजाता &c.\n\n_Bahuvrihi_ compounds get acute accent on the final syllable when they fall under the rules (VI. 2. 170) and the following.",
    "41053": "The words अन्तोदात्तात् and क्तान्तात् govern this _sutra_. This aphorism lays down an option, where by the last aphorism, it would have been compulsory. Thus शार्ङ्गजग्ध, is a word having acute accent on the final (VI. 2. 170), but as the first portion of this _Bahuvrihi_ is not a _Svanga_ word, but a _jati_ word, its feminine will be शार्ङ्गजग्धी or शार्ङ्गजग्धा ॥ So also पलाण्डुभक्षिती or पलाण्डुभक्षिता and सुरापीती or सुरापीता.\n\nWhy do we say 'when the first member of the compound is not a _svanga_ word'? Observe शंखभिन्नी, ऊरुभिन्नी which admit of only one form.\n\nIf the final is not acutely accented, the rule will not apply. As वस्त्रछन्ना and वसनछन्ना which are not acutely accented on the final (See VI. 2. 170), because the first member is a word denoting dress or आच्छादन, which is especially excepted from the scope of rule (VI. 2. 170).\n\nVart:- Diversely in the _Chhandas_ and in Names. As प्रवृद्धविलूनी or प्रवृद्धविलूना ॥",
    "41054": "The _Anuvritti_ of the words बहुव्रीहेः, क्तान्तादन्तोदात्तात् does not extend to this aphorism. But the _anuvritti_ of the word वा 'optionally' does extend to this _Sutra_. Thus चन्द्रमुखी or चन्द्रमुखा, अतिकेशी or अतिकेशा ॥ The word अतिकेशा  is a _Tatpurusha_ compound meaning अतिक्रान्ता केशान्, and केश is _upasarjana_ by (I. 2. 44).\n\nWhy do we say \"what ends with the name of a part of the body\"? Observe बहुयवा 'having much barley'. Why do we say \"subordinate in a compound\"? Witness अशिखा \"without crest\" (where the शिखा is not subordinate or epithetical). Why do we say \"not having a conjunct for its penultimate letter\"? Witness सुगुल्फा, सुपार्श्वा ॥\n\nVart :- This rule applies to a compound ending with the word अङ्ग, गात्र and कण्ठ, though in all these, the penultimate is a double consonant. Thus मृद्वङ्गी or मृद्वङ्गा; सुगात्री or सुगात्रा, स्निग्धकण्ठी or स्निग्धकण्ठा ॥\n\nThe word स्वांग has a technical meaning as given in the following verse:-\n\nअद्रवं मूर्तिमत्स्वाङ्गं प्राणिस्थमविकारजम् ।\nअतत्स्थं तत्रदृष्टं चेत् तेन चेत् तत्तथायुतम् ॥\n\nA word denoting a thing which not being a fluid, is capable of being perceived by the senses because of its having a form, is _svanga_; it must exist in a living being, but not produced by a change from the natural state; or though found elsewhere actually, had previously been known as existing in only a living being, or is found to have actually the same relation to the being it is in, as a similar thing has to a living being.",
    "41055": "This is an exception to the last and the succeeding _sutra_. Some of the words above given are either such which have a conjunct penultimate letter, and thus beyond the scope of (IV. 1. 54); or they are polysyllabic words and thus covered by (IV. 1. 56). Though this rule is an exception to (IV. 1. 54) and (IV. 1. 56); yet it is qualified by (IV. I. 57). Thus तुङ्गनासिका or तुङ्गनासिकी, तिलोदरी or तिलोदरा, बिम्बोष्ठी or बिम्बोष्ठा, दीर्घजंघी or दीर्घजंघा, समदन्ती or समदन्ता, चारुकर्णी or चारुकर्णा, तीक्ष्णसृङ्गी or तीक्ष्णशृङ्गा ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word पुच्छ 'tail'. As कल्याणपुच्छा or कल्याणपुच्छी ॥\n\nVart:- The affix _nish_ comes necessarily and not optionally after compounds of पुच्छ with कबर, मणि, विष and शर ॥ As, कबरपुच्छी 'a peahen' मणिपुच्छी, विषपुच्छी, 'a scorpion' and शरपुच्छी ॥\n\nVart:- So also the feminine affix _nish_ is necessarily employed after the words पक्ष and पुच्छ when used as a simile or as objects of comparison. As उलूकपक्षी सेना, उलूकपुच्छी शाला ॥",
    "41056": "The class क्रोड् &c. is _akriti_-_gana_, that is a class of words constituted by usage. The following are some of the examples:- As कल्याणक्रोडा, कल्याणखुरा, कल्याणोखा, कल्याणबाला, कल्याणशफा, कल्याणगुदा, कल्याणघाणा ॥ So also सुभगा, सुगला, &c. Of the case where the word is polysyllabic, the examples are सुजघना, पृथुजघना, महाललाटा, ॥ The word कोडा is feminine itself, and in the _Bahuvrihi_ the feminine sign of the first member is elided by _pungvad_-_bhava_, and क्रोडा is shortened to क्रोड because it is an _upasarjana_ (1. 2. 48).",
    "41057": "Thus सकेशा, अकेशा विद्यमानकेशा ॥ So also सनासिका अनासिका or विद्यमाननासिका ॥ The last example shows, that the present rule governs also (IV. 1. 55) _ante_: as well as (IV. 1. 54).",
    "41058": "Thus शूर्प + नखा, = शूर्पणखा, '_Surpanakha_ the sister of _Ravana_'. The न् is changed into ण् by (VIII. 4. 3) (पूर्वपदात् संज्ञायामगः) ॥ So also वज्रणखा, गौरमुखा, कालमुखा &c. Why do we say 'when denoting a Name'? Witness ताम्रमुखी कन्या 'a copper-faced damsel', or चन्द्रमुखी 'moon-faced'.",
    "41059": "The word दीर्घजीह्वी is the feminine of दीर्घजीह्व but as the latter has a conjunct consonant for its penultimate, the feminine affix ङीष् would not have applied to it by (IV. 1. 54). The present aphorism enjoins ङीष् ॥ Thus दीर्घजीह्वी in the sentence दीर्घजीह्वी वै देवानां हव्यमलेट् ।\n\nThe word च 'and' in the aphorism is used in order to draw in the word संज्ञा from the last, so that the word _dirgha_-jihvi is always a Name. Moreover by using the feminine form _dirgha_-jihvi in the _sutra_, it is indicated that the application of ङीष् is necessary and not optional, as was the case in the last _sutras_.",
    "41060": "This aphorism over-rules all the rules and prohibitions contained in _sutras_ (IV. 1. 54) to (IV. 1. 58). Whereever by those rules there would have been ङीष्, the present enjoins ङीप् instead. Though the form will be the same, the difference will be in the accent; the affix ङीप् being _anudatta_ (III. 1. 4). Thus प्राङ्मुखी or प्राङ्मुखा, प्राङ्नासिकी or प्रांनासिका, But not so in प्राग्गुल्फा; प्राक्क्रोडा or प्राग्जघना because these words do not take ङीष् (by (IV. I. 56)), therefore they never give occasion to the application of ङीप् ॥ The _sutra_ ought to be read as if it contained two rules (1) the affix ङीष् comes after a compound the first member of which is a word denoting direction and the second is a _svanga_ word or is the word नासिका &c. the penultimate not being a conjunct consonant, (2) but ङीष् is not added to Compounds ending in क्रोड &c. or in a word of more than two syllables. In other words the _sutra_ may be translated \"ङीप् is the substitute of ङीष् when the first member is a word denoting direction\". Therefore the affix ङीप् will come only there, where else the affix ङीष् would have come and not otherwise. This is the reason why the _anuvritti_ of ङीष् is taken in the next _sutra_ (IV. 1. 61) and not that of ङीप् ॥",
    "41061": "The _anuvritti_ of ङीष् is to be taken in this aphorism and not that of ङीप्, though the latter was nearer. The word वाह् is formed from the root वाह् with the affix ण्वि (III. 2. 64). The word वाह् is never found alone, but as ends of compounds, hence we apply the rule of _tadanta_, and have translated it by saying a \"word ending in _vah_.\" Thus दित्यौही 'sustaining the demon'. This form is thus evolved :- दित्य + वाह् + ङीष् = दित्य + ऊठ् + आह् + ङीष् ((VI. 4. 132) वाह ऊठ्, _Uth_ is the _samprasarana_ of _vah_, when this is a _bha_) = दित्य + ऊह् + ङीष् (VI. 1. 108) संप्रसारणाच्च 'after a _samprasarana_ if a vowel follow, the form of the prior is the single substitute'), = दित्यौही ((VI. 1. 89) एत्येधत्यूठ्सु '_vriddhi_ is the single substitute when _eti_, _edhati_ or _uth_ follow'). Similarly प्रष्ठौही 'a young heifer training for the plough.'",
    "41062": "Thus सखीयं मे ब्राह्मणी, and नास्याः शिशरस्तीति = अशिश्वी ॥ Why do we say in vernacular Sanskrit ? Observe सखा सप्तपदी भव and अशिशुमिव मामयं शिशुरभिमन्यते ॥\n\nSometimes we find these forms in the Vedas also, though rarely, as आधेनवो धुनयन्तामशिश्वी ॥ सखी सप्तपदी भव ॥",
    "41063": "The word जाति was defined under _Sutra_ (I. 2. 52). Thus कुक्कुटी 'a hen'; सूकरी 'a she-hog', ब्राह्मणी '_Brahmani_'; वृषली 'a woman of the _Sudra_ caste', नाडायनी 'a woman of _Nadayana_ class', चारायणी 'a _Charayani_', कटी 'a woman of _Brahmans_ who read the _Katha_', बह्वृची 'a woman of the class of _Brahmans_ who read the _Rig_ _Veda_'.\n\nWhy do we say \"expressive of a _jati_\"? Observe मुण्डा 'shaven' ( where the word expresses not a _jati_ but a quality). Why do we say \"not invariably feminine\"? Witness मक्षिका 'a fly' (supposed to breed without a male). Why do we say \"not having the letter य् for its penultimate?\" Witness क्षत्रिया 'a female of the _Kshatriya_ class'.\n\nVart:- In excluding words that have the letter य् as penultimate, there is not involved the exclusion of the following words which have a penultimate य्) viz, गवय 'the Bos Gaveans', हय 'horse', मुकय 'a sort of animal', मत्स्य 'a fish', and मनुष्य 'a man'. Thus गवयी, हयी, मनुषी, ((VI. 4. 150) हलस्तद्धितस्य 'there is elision of the य् of a _taddhita_ affix coming after a consonant when long ई follows') मत्सी ॥ The य् of _matsya_ is elided by the _vartika_ 'मत्स्यस्य ङ्याम्' ॥ See also (VI. 4. 149). All these words are also included in the class गौरादि (IV. I. 41.) and would have taken ङीष् independently of this _vartika_.\n\nAnother definition of _jati_ is:-\n\nप्रादुर्भावविनाशाभ्यां सत्यस्य युगपद्गुणैः ।\nअसर्वलिंगां बह्वर्यो तां जातिं कवयो विदुः ॥ (See translation under (I. 2. 52))",
    "41064": "Here the affix applies to words which in their original sense denoted females and therefore were not provided by the last _sutra_. Thus ओदनपाकी, शंककुर्णी, शालपर्णी, शंखपुष्पी, दासीफली दर्भमूली, and गोवाली ॥\n\nWhen, however the affix ङीष् is not intended to be applied to compounds ending with फल, पुष्प, and मूल, then those compounds will fall under _Ajadi_ class (IV. 1. 4); such as संफला, भस्त्रफला, सत्पुष्पा, अमूला &c.",
    "41065": "Thus अवन्ती 'women of _Avanti_', कुन्ती 'women of _Kunti_', दाक्षी '_Dakshi_'. Thus अवन्ति + ञ्यङ् (IV. 1. 171) आवन्त्यः 'men of _Avanti_'. In the feminine this affix by (IV. 1. 176) is elided. प्लाक्षी \"the female descendants of _Plaksha_\". Why do we say \"ending in short इ\"? Witness विट् '_Vaishya_', दरत् '_Darat_'. Why do we say \"of men\"? Witness तित्तिरिः 'partridge'. Though the _anuvritti_ of the word जाति could have been read into this aphorism from (IV. 1. 63), its repetition here indicates that ङीष् is to be applied even when the penultimate letter is य् Thus औदमयी ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies to words ending in the _taddhita_ affix इञ् (IV. 2. 80) though they do not denote a _jati_ Thus सौतंगमी, मौनचित्ती ॥ The affix इञ् here referred to is the quadruply significant affix taught in (IV. 2. 80) and ordained to come after सुतंगम &c, and does not denote a _jati_.",
    "41066": "The _anuvritti_ of the words मनुष्यजाति and अयोपधात् should be read into the _sutra_ to complete it. Thus कूरूः 'a female of the country of the _Kurus_' ब्रह्मबन्धूः \"a _Brahmani_ of the class of the fallen _Brahmans_ so called\", जीवबन्धूः \"a woman of the _Jivabandhu_ class”.\n\nThus कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः (IV. 1. 172), and this affix is elided by (IV. 1. 176) in the feminine.\n\nThe indicatory letter ङ् in ऊङ् is to distinguish this affix in _Sutras_ like नोङ् धात्वोः (VI. 1. 175), for had the affix been enunciated merely as ऊ, then the _Sutra_ (VI. 1.175) would have run as नो धात्वोः and the sense would have been ambiguous, for we could not have known what affix was particularly meant there.\n\nThe long ऊ is taught to debar the affix कप्, for a short उ would have also given the form करू (कुरु + उ = कुरू) ॥ The long ऊ therefore, indicates that the affix कप्, enjoined by (V. 4. 154), in _Bahuvrihis_, will not apply in the feminine forms ब्रह्मबन्धूः and the like, by the rule of _vipratishedha_.\n\nWhy do we say \"not having the letter य् as its penultimate\"? Witness अध्वर्युर्ब्राह्मणी 'a woman of the class of _Brahmanas_ versed in the _Yajur_ _Veda_'.\n\nVart:- The affix ऊङ् comes under similar conditions after words denoting non-animate _jati_, except the words रज्जु &c. Thus अलाबूः 'the bottle gourd'; कर्कन्धूः 'the jujube tree.' Why do we say \"non-animate\"? Witness कृकवाकुः 'a kind of lizard.' Why do we say \"except the word _rajju_ &c\" Witness रज्जुः 'rope'; हनुः 'cheek' &c.",
    "41067": "Thus भद्रबाहूः '_Bhadrabahu_'; जालबाहूः &c. Why do we say in \"expressing a Name\"? Observe वृत्तबाहूः 'a woman having rounded hand' which is an attributive word. In other words, when the compound is a name, बाहु takes long ऊ in the feminine.",
    "41068": "As पंगू 'a female lame'.\n\nVart:- The feminine affix ऊङ् is added to श्वशुर, and thereby there is elision of the letter उ and of the letter अ of the word. As श्वश्रूः 'mother-in-law' This debars the _punyoga_ ङीष् of (IV. 1. 48).",
    "41069": "Thus कदलास्तम्भोरूः 'a female with thighs like plantain-stem'. नागनासोरूः 'a female with thighs like the nose of an elephant';  करभोरूः 'female with thighs like the ulnar or tapering fleshy side of the hand'.\n\nWhy do we say \"when expressing an object of comparison\"? Witness वृत्तोरूः स्त्री 'a woman with round thighs'. The word करेणुकरोरु \"thigh like the proboscis (कर)of an elephant (करेणु)\" is a poetic irregularity in the following विचकरे च करेणुकरोरुभिः ॥",
    "41070": "This aphorism applies, when no comparison is intended. As संहितोरूः 'a female whose thighs are joined (e.g. from obesity)' शफोरूः 'whose thighs are put together like the two hoofs on a cow's foot,' लक्षणोरूः 'whose thighs are marked,' वामोरूः 'with handsome thighs.'\n\nVart:- So also with the words सहित and सह. As सहितोरूः and सहोरूः ॥",
    "41071": "Thus कद्रुश्चवै सुपर्णी च ॥ मास्मकमण्डलूं शूद्राय दद्यात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"in the Vedas.\" Witness कद्रुः and कमण्डलुः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the words गुग्गुलु, मधु, जतु and पतयालुः ॥ Thus गुग्गुलूः, मधूः, जतूः, and पतयालूः ॥",
    "41072": "This rule applies to other than Vedic forms. Thus कद्रूः 'a female named _Kadru_ wife of _Kasyapa_', कमण्डलूः '_Kamandalu_'. Why do we say \"in denoting a Name\"? Observe कद्रूः 'the tawny color.' कमण्डलूः 'a water-gourd'.",
    "41073": "Thus शार्ङ्गरवी 'a _Sarngrava_ woman', कापटवी 'a _Kapatava_ woman'. So also after a word formed with the affix अञ् (as ordained in S. 86, and 104 &c. of this chapter), as, बैदी 'a female descendant of _Bida_'. और्वी 'a female descendant of _Urva_'. This _sutra_ applies to words expressing _jati_ or kind. In other words, this aphorism debars the affix ङीष् of (IV. 1. 63) &c. where it came after _jati_-_vachaka_ words; but it does not debar that ङीष् which is employed in describing the relation of wife, such as, the ङीष् of (IV. 1. 48).\n\nThe difference between ङीष् and ङीन् consists in accent only, the resultant forms otherwise being the same. The words formed by ङीन् will have _udatta_ accent on the first syllable ञ्नित्यादिर्नित्यम् ((VI. 1. 197) a word ending with an affix having an indicatory ञ् or न् has _udatta_ accent on the first syllable') : while the word formed by ङीष् will have acute accent on the affix. Thus बैदी 'a female descendant of _Bida_', and बैदी 'the wife of _Baida_'.\n\nThe following is a list of _Sarngaravadi_ class words:-\n\n1 शार्गंरव, 2 कापटव, 3 गौग्गुलव, 4 ब्राह्मण, 5 बैद, 6 गौतम ॥ These words are formed by the affix अण् the first four being formed by the अण् of ( IV. 1. 83) from शृंगरु, कपटु, गुग्गुलु and ब्रह्मन्; the word गौतम is formed from गोतम by the अण् of (IV. 1. 114). This word is also included in _Gauradi_ class (IV. 1. 41). 7 कामण्डलेय, 8 ब्राह्मकृतेव, 9 आनिचेय, 10 आनिधेय, 11 आशीकेय ॥ These are formed by ढक् (IV. 1. 123) except _kamandaleya_ which is formed by ढञ् (IV. 1. 135). 12 वात्स्यायन, 13 मौञ्जायन ॥ These are formed by फक् of (IV. I. 101) and (IV. 1. 99), and denote castes or _Gotra_. 14 कैकसेय is also formed by ढक् (IV. 1. 123). 15 काव्य 16 शैव्य are formed by ञ्यङ् (IV. 1. 171). 17 एहि, 18 पर्येहि are formed by इन् added to आ + इह् 'to try', and परि + आ + इह् (_Un_ IV. 117 सर्व धातुभ्य इन्) 19 आश्मरथ्य is formed by यञ् (IV. 1. 105). 20 औदपान is formed by अण् (IV. 3. 76). 21 अराल, 22 चण्डाल, 23 वतण्डः are _jati_ words. 24 भोगवत्, 25 गौरिमत् ॥ These take ङ्गीन् when denoting a Name. These words are formed by the affix मतुप्, and are consequently उगित्, and should have taken ङीप् (IV. 1. 6). This ordains ङीन् ॥\n\nQ. The word भोग is formed by घञ् and गौरि is formed by इञ् (IV. 1. 95), both are _adyuddatta_ owing to ञ् (VI. 1. 197). When मतुप् is added, the accent remains unchanged, for _matup_ being पित् is _anudatta_ (I11. 1. 4). Therefore whether ङीप् be added or ङीन् to these words, it makes no difference in the accent, for they remain _adyudatta_. Where is the necessity of including these two words in this list.\n\nAns. To this we reply घादिषु नित्यम् हृस्वार्थम् ॥ For had these words taken ङीप् of (IV. 1. 6), then the long ई would have been optionally shortened before the affixes घ &c. by (VI. 3. 45). But by taking ङीन् the shortening is compulsory (VI. 3. 43), and not optional. Because the च in the _sutra_ उगितश्च (VI. 3. 45) has the force of the word इति, and means the नदी words formed by adding ई to उगित् words, by enunciating the word उगित् are optionally shortened. Therefore (IV. 1. 6) where the word उगित् is used is governed by this rule of optional shortening, and not the words formed by ङीन् ॥\n\n26 नृ 27 नर. The word नृ would have taken ङीप् by (IV. 1. 5), and नर would have taken ङीष् as it denotes a _jati_. These words take _vriddhi_ before ङीन्, the form being नारी in both cases.",
    "41074": "The affix यङ् here denotes and includes both the affixes ञ्यङ् (as taught in S. 171 of this chapter) and ष्यङ् (See 78) as it is the common element of both. Thus आम्बष्ठ्या 'woman of the race of _Ambashthya_', ससुवीर्या 'a woman of the race of _Sauvirya_', कौसल्या 'a woman of the race of _Kausalya_'.\n\nSimilarly ष्यङ् formed words, as, कारीषगन्ध्या, वाराह्या; बालाक्या ॥\n\nVart:- The affix चाप् comes in the feminine after a word ending with the affix यञ् when the letter ष् immediately precedes such _yan_. As शार्कराक्ष्य 'a female descendant of _Sarkaraksha_', पौतिमाष्या 'a female descendant of _Putimashya_', गौकाक्ष्या 'a female descendant of _Gokasha_'. These words belong to _Gargadi_ class (IV. I. 105), and by _sutra_ 16 would have taken ङीप् ॥\n\nThe प् of the affix चाप् is for the sake of forming a common term आप् with डाप् and टाप्; and the च regulates the accent making the final acute (VI. I. 163). The word गौकाक्ष्य is included in _Kraudadi_ list (IV. 1. 80) and takes the augment ष्यङ् in the feminine, and hence it would have taken चाप् by force of the present _sutra_ and need not be included in the _Vartika_. There is no _Samprasarana_ of the य when पुत्र or पति is added to this word (VI. 1. 13), the form being गौकाक्ष्यापुत्रः and not गौकाक्षीपुत्रः ॥",
    "41075": "The word अवट belongs to _Gargadi_ class (IV. 1. 105) which after taking यञ्, would have taken ङीप् (IV. I. 16). Thus आवट्या 'a female descendant of _Avata_'. But आवट्यायनी will be the proper form according to the Eastern Grammarians. See aphorism (IV. 1. 17).",
    "41076": "This is an _adhikara_ or governing _sutra_. Up to the end of the Fifth Book, all the affixes that will be taught, are to be understood to have the name of _Taddhita_. Thus the affix ति taught in the very next _sutra_. As युवतिः The word so formed is called _Pratipadika_. The word तद्धिताः is in the  number, and not exhibited in the singular, like the words प्रत्ययः (III. I. 1) &c; and it, therefore, indicates that it includes also affixes which are not especially taught in this book. Such as पृथिव्य ञाञौ॥ अग्रादि पश्चाड् डिमच् ॥ As पार्थिव, अग्रिम, आदिम, पश्चिम ॥ See _Vart_ IV. 3. 23. The word _Taddhita_ is used in _Sutras_ like कृत्तद्धितसमासाश्च (I. 2. 46).",
    "41077": "As युवतिः 'a young maid'. By (IV. 1. 5), ङीप् would have been otherwise employed, the present _sutra_ debars it. The word युवति ending in इ does not take the affix ङीष् of (IV. 1. 65), for the affix ति itself is a feminine-making affix though a _Taddhita_: or the word युवन् may be regarded as a non-_jati_ word and hence (IV. 1. 65) would not apply.",
    "41078": "The wording of this aphorism requires a little analysis. It consists of five words: (1) अणिञोः 'of अण् and इञ्' (2) अनार्षयोः 'of non-_rishi_' (3) गुरूपोत्तमयोः 'having a heavy vowel as _upottama_ i. e. last but one,' (4) ष्यङ 'the substitute is _shyan_' (5) गोत्रे 'in denoting _gotra_.' That is to say, the _gotra_ affixes अण् and इञ् are replaced by ष्यङ् before the feminine affix चाप्, in those words which denoting non-_rishi_ _gotras_, have a heavy vowel as last but one. The word _uttama_ meaning last letter, being formed by the superlative affix _tamap_, implies that the word must be of at least three syllables. Therefore, the present _sutra_ does not apply to forms like दाक्षि &c.\n\nOf the substitute ष्यङ् the letter ष् and ङ् are indicatory, the real affix is य, the letter ष् differentiating this affix from ञ्यङ् and the letter ङ् affording a common hold for both. In forming the feminine we shall have to add चाप् by (IV. 1.74). Thus करीषगन्धि 'having the smell of dung-cake', is the name of a person. In forming a patronymic from this word, we add the affix अण् ॥ Thus करीषगन्धि + अण् (IV. 1. 92) Replace this affix by ष्य and we have कारीषगन्ध्या ॥ कुमुदगन्धि  gives us कौमुदगन्ध्या ॥ Similarly with words taking the affix इञ् (as taught in _sutra_ अतइञ् (IV. 1. 75): as वाराहिः gives us वाराह्या, so also बालाक्या ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of अण् and इञ् ॥ Witness आर्तभागा from ऋतभाग ॥ Here the word ऋतभाग belongs to बिदादि  _gana_, and therefore by (IV. 1. 104), it would take the affix अञ् in forming _gotra_ patronymic: this affix अञ् is not replaced by ष्यङ्, and the feminine is by long ई (IV. 1. 15); for though, its last vowel but one is heavy, it is a non-_rishi_ _gotra_ word, yet it does not fulfil the other condition of taking the affix अण् or इञ् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of non-_ rishi_ _gotras_'? Witness वासिष्ठी and वैश्वामित्री ॥ Why do we say 'whose last vowel but one is heavy'? Observe औपगवी and कापटवी ॥ Why do we say 'denoting _Gotra_?' Witness आहिच्छत्री 'born in _Ahichhatra_', कान्यकुब्जी 'born in _Kanyakubja_'.",
    "41079": "The phrase अणिञोः of the last _sutra_ governs this also, not so, however, the word अगरूपोत्तमः ॥ The phrase गोत्रावयव means insignificant or non-famous _gotras_. i. e. names of _kulas_ i. e. कुलाख्या, such as families like पुणिक, भुणिक, मुखर which are not famous and are not included in the _gotra_ list. Thus पौणिक्या, भौणिक्या and मौखर्या ॥\n\nThe word अवयव in the _sutra_ has various significations, one sense being 'separate from', another being 'part of', and 'individual members' &c. If the last sense be taken, then we can evolve forms like दैवदत्त्या याज्ञदत्या ॥ These forms may also be explained by taking them as belonging to the कौड्यादि class of the next aphorism. In short, those who wish to apply this aphorism to 'the immediate descendant', such as 'the son or daughter', and not to a _gotra_ descendant, which means a grandson and down; can also do so.\n\nIn fact the word गोत्रावयव is equal to अवयवगोत्र or अप्रधानगोत्र and is a _karmadharaya_ _samasa_, namely _gotras_ not enumerated in the प्रवराध्यायः ॥ These are, however technically called कुल ॥",
    "41080": "This rule applies even where the syllable next to the final is not heavy, and even where the word does not take the affix अण् or इञ् ॥ In fact ष्यङ् is not a substitute here but an augment. Thus क्रौड्या 'a female _Kraudi_' लाड्या 'a female _Ladi_'. The following is the list of _Kraudadi_ words:-\n\n1 क्रौडि, 2 लाडि, 3 व्याडि, 4 आपिशालि, 5 आपक्षिति. These are formed by इञ् (IV. 1. 95). 6 चौपयत, 7 चैटयत (वैटयत), 8 सैकयत (शैकयत) 9 वैल्वयत (वैकल्पयत्), These are formed by the affix अण् ॥ 10 सौधातकि. This is formed by इञ् with the substitute अकङ् (IV. 1. 97) added to सुधातृ ॥ 11 सूतयुवत्याम् The word सूत takes ष्यङ् when denoting a grown-up maiden as सूत्याः; otherwise सूता 'a daughter', formed by टाप्, or सूती by ङीष् denoting a _jati_. 12 भोज क्षत्रिये ॥ This debars ङीष् of _jati_ as भोज्याः, otherwise टाप् as भोजाः (भोजयति), 13 यौतकि, 14 कौटि, 15 भौरिकी, 16 भौलिकि, 17 शाल्मलि, 18 शालास्थलि, 19 कापिष्ठलि, 20 गौकक्ष्य (गौलक्ष्य) ॥ All these except the last are formed by इञ्, the last is formed by यञ् of _Gargadi_ class.",
    "41081": "These words end in the affix इञ्, and the word _gotra_ is not understood in the _sutra_. In the case of _gotra_ descendants, the substitute _shyan_ would have come by (IV. 1. 78.) but whereas by that _sutra_ it would have been compulsory, the present aphorism makes it optional. But if the _sutra_ be taken to apply to 'immediate descendants' as opposed to _gotra_ descendants, then this is a new rule altogether and not a rider to (IV. 1. 87). In the alternative when ष्यङ् is not added, ङीष् will be added by rule (IV. 1. 65) _ante_. Thus दैवयज्ञ्याor दैवयज्ञी, so also शौचिवृक्ष्या or शौचिवृक्षी, सात्यमुग्र्या or सात्यमुग्री, काण्ठेविद्ध्या or काण्ठेविद्धी ॥",
    "41082": "All the three words, viz. (1) समर्थानां 'of the words in construction' (2) प्रथमात् 'after the first'; (3) वा 'on the alternative', exert a governing influence on the subsequent aphorisms, up to the aphorisms which leave to the words their own denotation : that is to say, up to the end of the second chapter of the fifth Book; before the beginning of the _sutra_ प्राग्दिशो विभक्तिः (V. 3. 1). The present _sutra_ as a whole, of course, has no applicability to the affixes which leave to the words their own denotation (स्वार्थिक); for the latter affixes are in many cases compulsory and not optional, as are the affixes to be taught hereafter in Book Fourth and the first and second chapters of Book Fifth.\n\nThese affixes will come after the word, that is signified by the first of the words in construction, in an aphorism. Thus (IV. 1. 92) declares तस्यापत्यम् 'his son'. Here the first word is तस्य 'his', therefore, the affixes forming the patronymics will come after the word signified by 'his': i.e. after the word in the genitive case. As उपगोरपत्यं = ओपगवः 'the son of _Upagu_'. Here the affix अण् comes after the word उपगु which is the first word representing '_tasya_' in the genitive case in the sentence उपगोरपत्यम् ॥ Similarly in the _sutra_ तेनरक्त रागात् (IV. 2. 1); here the first word is तेन, therefore, the affix will be added to the word in the instrumental case in a sentence representing the word तेन 'by which'; as कषायेण रक्तं वस्त्रं = काषायं, '_Kashaya_ is a cloth, coloured by _Kashaya_'. Similarly in _sutra_ तत्र भवः 'there staying' (IV. 3. 53.) here the first word is तत्र, 'there', in the locative case, therefore the affix will be optionally added to the word in the locative case in a sentence, representing the word तत्र 'there' : as स्रुघ्ने भवः = स्रौघ्नः \"who stays in _Srughna_'.\n\nThe word समर्थानाम् is the genitive plural of समर्थ, and the force of the genitive is that of specification or '_nirdharana_':- i. e. 'among the words in construction, the first is specifically pointed out as the _prakriti_ or base, to which the affix is to be added'. Why do we say \"among the words in construction\"? Witness कम्बल उपगोरपत्यं देवदत्तस्य 'the blanket of _Upagu_; the son of _Devadatta_'. Here the two words उपगोरपत्यं are not in construction, for उपगोः governs कम्बलः, and अपत्यं is governed by देवदत्तस्य ॥ Why do we say \"after the first\"? So that the affix may come after the first word उपगोः in the genitive case, and not after अपत्यं which is in the nominative case, Why do we say \"in the alternative\" ? Because the same idea may also be expressed by a sentence; thus we may say उपगोरपत्यं, instead of the _Taddhita_ formed word औपगवः ॥ The same idea may also be expressed by a compound word (_samasa_); as उपग्वपत्यम् 'the son of _Upagu_'. In fact, the _samasa_ rule here is not superseded by _ Taddhita_-rule, as it otherwise would have been by (1. 4. 2.) because the _anuvritti_ of अन्यतरस्याम् is understood here: so that in the alternative when the _Taddhita_ affix is not employed, the _samasa_ rules will find scope.\n\nThis _sutra_ has been thus rendered by Dr. Bohtlingk: \"when hence forth the meaning is specified in which an affix is to be added, then one should know that the rule applies to the first of those words which are associated with one another in sense, and that the affix is optional\".",
    "41083": "Up to aphorism (IV. 4. 2), the affix अण् has a governing influence, except where it is specifically superseded by any particular rule. This aphorism may be looked upon either as an _adhikara_ _sutra_ or a _paribhasha_ _sutra_ or a _vidhi_ _sutra_. The application of this aphorism will be illustrated throughout the next three chapters. Thus in (IV. 1. 92) तस्यापत्यम् we read the present aphorism and add the affix अण् in the sense of 'his son'. As औपगवः 'the son of उपगुः'; कापटवः 'the son of _Kapatu_'.\n\nThis affix has various meanings, such as, a patronymic (IV. 1. 92), coloured with (IV. 2. 1), sidereal time (IV. 1. 3), revealed _sama_-_veda_ (IV. 1. 7), covered car (IV. 2. 10) &c.",
    "41084": "This is an exception to the next aphorism, by which the affix ण्य would have come after words ending with '_pati_.' The present _sutra_ enjoins अण् instead. Thus अश्वपति + अण् = आश्वपतम् (VII. 2 117) तद्धितेष्वचामादे 'when a _Taddhita_ affix follows with an indicatory ञ् or ण्, there is _vriddhi_ in the room of the first rowel among the vowels'). The इ of पति is elided by (VI. 4. 148) यस्येति च where long ई follows, and when a _Taddhita_ affix follows, there is elision of the इ or ई, or अ or आ, of a _bha_'.)\n\nThe following is a list of words belonging to अश्वपत्यादि class :-\n\nअक्षपति, 2 ज्ञानपति, 3 शतपति, 4 गणपति, 5 गणपति, 6 स्थानपति, यज्ञपति, 8 राष्ट्रपति, 9 कुलपति, 10 गृहपति, (पशुपति) 11 धान्यपति, 12 धन्वपति,13 बन्धुपति, 14 धर्मपति, 15 सभापति, 16 प्राणपति, 17 क्षेत्रपति ॥",
    "41085": "Thus दिति + ण्य = दैत्यः 'the son of _Diti_.' आदित्यः 'the descendant of _Aditi_', आदित्यम् ' sacred to _Aditya_.' Similarly with words ending with पति, as प्रजापति + ण्य = प्राजापत्यं; so also सैनापत्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word यम; as याम्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_, after the words वाच्, मति and पितृमत् ॥ As वाच्यम् (_Vs_, 13, 58.) मात्यम् and पैतृमत्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes ञ् and अञ् come after the word पृथिवी ॥ Thus पृथिवी + ञ = पार्थिव; पृथिवी + अञ् = पार्थिव ॥ The resulting forms are the same, but the feminine of the former will be पार्थिवा by (IV. I. 4), and that of the latter पार्थिवी applying (IV. 1. 15).\n\nVart:- The affixes यञ् and अञ् come after the word देव 'a god'. As दैव्यम् or दैवम् 'divine'.\n\nVart:- There is elision of the टि of बहिस्, and there is the affix यञ्; as बहिस् + यञ् = बाह्यः 'external'. Vart:- and the affix ईकक् may be employed. As बहिस् + ईकक् = बाहिकः 'external'. (VII. 2. 118 किति च, there is _vriddhi_ of the first vowel when the _Taddhita_ affix has an indicatory क्). Vart:- In the _Chhandas_ it takes the affix ईकञ् as बाहिकः the difference being in the accent (VI. 1. 197).\n\nThe word बहिस् is an अव्यय, and the above _vartika_ declares that its टि portion is elided. This very fact indicates by implication, that the टि of other _Avyayas_ need not necessarily be elided before those affixes, before which the base is called भ _bha_. In fact the following _vartika_ अव्यायानाञ्च (the टि of the _avyaya_ base is elided) given under (sutra_ (VI. 4. 144) (the टि of the base _bha_ is elided when a _taddhita_ affix follows) is not a universal rule. Thus from the _avyaya_ आरात् we get आराती &c; here the टि is not elided.\n\nVart:- Of the word स्थामन् the टि is replaced by अ as अश्वत्थामः ॥\n\nVart:- The टि of लोमन् is replaced by ञ in the plural when the patronymic affixes follow; as उडुलोमाः, शरलोमाः ॥ Why do we say in the plural number ? Witness औडुलोमिः, शारलोमिः (IV. 1.99).\n\nVart:- When an affix beginning with a vowel presents itself after the word गो, let the affix यत् be substituted for it. Thus what is descended (or produced, &c) from गो is expressed by गव्यम् (VI. 1. 79). Why do we say 'beginning with a vowel' ? Observe गोभ्यो हितं or आगतं = गोरूप्यम् and गोमयम् ॥\n\nVart:- These affixes ण्य &c, taught in this _sutra_ will come, to the exclusion of all the other affixes hereinafter taught, which are employed in especial senses. Thus अण् is employed especially to denote a descendant. But after the words दिति &c अण् will not be employed, but ण्य, as दैत्य 'a descendant of दिति'. So also वानस्पत्यम् = (वनस्पतीनाम् समुहः), to the exclusion of (IV. 2. 37) &c. In fact the rule for विप्रतिषेधे परंकार्य्यम् (I. 4. 2) does not hold good here.\n\nIf that be so, how do you explain the form दैतेयः ॥ This word is not directly formed from the word दिति but from दिती, the feminine of the word दिति, formed by the affix ङीष् (IV. 1. 45), the word दिति being formed by the _Krit_ affix क्तिन् and therefore it will take ङीष् in the feminine). To the feminine word दिती is added ढक् and we get दैतेयः ॥ The _Paribhasha_ प्रातिपदिकग्रहणे लिङ्ग विशिष्टस्यापि ग्रहणम् (a rule of grammar which applies to a masculine applies also to the same word in the feminine) is not of universal application, as this very illustration shows. Others consider the form दैतेय as incorrect, as not to be found either in the _Mahabhashya_ or any _Vartika_.",
    "41086": "This debars the affix अण् taught in (IV. 1. 83) as well as the especial affixes here-in-after taught. Thus उत्स + अञ् = औत्सः, औदपानः ॥ The following is the list of words belonging to उत्सादि class.\n\n1 उत्स, 2 उदपान, 3 विकर, 4 विनद, 5 महानद 6 मदानस, 7 महाप्राण, 8 तरुण, 9 तलुन । 10 वष्कयासे । 11 पृथिवी, 12 धेनु, 13 पंक्ति, 14 जगती, 15 त्रिष्टुप्, 16 अनुष्टुभ्, 17 जनपद, 18 भरत, 19 उशीनर, 20 ग्रीष्म, 21 पीलुकुण. । 22. उदस्थान देशे । 23 पृष दंश, 24 भल्लकीय, 25 रथन्तर, 26 मध्यंदिन, 28 बृहत्, 28 महत्, 29 सत्त्वत्, 39कुरु, 31 पञ्चाल, 32 इन्द्रावसान, 33 उष्णिह्, 34 ककुभ्, 35 सुवर्ण, 35 देव, 37 ग्रीष्मादच्छन्दसि ॥\n\nVart:- The word ग्रीष्म in the above list, takes this affix, when it does not mean 'a metre of prosody'. Therefore it is not so here: ग्रैष्मी त्रिष्टुप् 'The _Graishmi_ _Tristup_ metre'. But ग्रैष्मः 'belonging to summer'. The word छन्दस् here means 'metre', and not _Veda_. The word बष्कयाऽसे = बष्कय असे, the phrase असे meaning असमासे, (स being the name given to समास by Ancient Grammarians). Thus the compound will be गोबष्कयिः ॥ The _Paribhasha_ ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्त विधिप्रतिषेधः does not apply here. Therefore, _tadantavidhi_ applies here and we have आधेनवम् (अधेनूनाम् समूहः) ॥ The word उदस्थान takes अञ् when meaning a 'place': as औदस्थानो देशः; otherwise औदस्थनिः 'the son of _Udasthana_'. The word पृषत् takes अञ् when meaning 'a share,' otherwise it will take अण्, as पार्षतोंऽशः ॥",
    "41087": "Thus स्त्री + नञ् = स्त्रैणम् 'feminine.' The sense of the affixes taught in the Fourth Book, and Chapter I of the Fifth Book, are various. Therefore the word स्त्रैणम् will have all those various significations; thus, it will mean either स्त्रीषुभवं (IV. 3. 53) 'existing in females,' or स्त्रीणां संमूहः (IV. 2. 37) 'a collection of females,; or स्त्रीभ्यआगतं (IV. 3. 74) 'what has come from females'; or स्त्रीभ्यो हितं (V. 1. 5) 'suitable for females' &c.\n\nSimilarly पुंस + स्नञ् = पौंस्नम् 'masculine, or existing in males, or a collection of males, or what has come from males, or suitable for males &c.'\n\nThese affixes, however, are not to be employed in the sense of the affix वत् taught in (V. 1. 115). For _Panini_ himself uses the form पुंवत् (and not पौंस) in _sutra_ (VI. 3. 34), thus indicating by implication (ज्ञापक) that in the sense of वत्, the affix स्नञ् is not to be used. Thus स्त्रीवत्, ॥ The forms स्त्रीत्वं, स्त्रीता, पुंस्त्वं and पुंस्त्वा are exceptional. See (V. 1. 121). The स् of पुंस् is elided before स्नञ् by (VIII. 2. 23.) had it not been elided, one affix नञ् would have been taught in the _sutra_, and not two.",
    "41088": "The phrase प्राग्दिव्यतः of (IV. 1. 83) governs this aphorism also, and not the phrase भवनात् of the last. Thus पञ्चसु कपालेषु संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः 'prepared in five cups.' Similarly दशकपालः \"prepared in ten cups.\" द्विवेदः 'he who studies two Vedas.' त्रिवेदः \"who studies three Vedas.\" Here the affixes denoting संस्कृतं (IV. 2. 16), and अधीते (IV. 2. 59) have been elided. Why do we say \"not so when the affix denotes a Patronymic.\"? Observe द्वैदेवदत्तिः 'a descendant of two _Devadattas_.' त्रैदेवदत्तिः 'a descendant of three _Devadattas_.' Here the patronymic affix is not elided, though the compound is a _Dvigu_.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it has the sense of the various affixes taught antecedent to _tena_ _divyati_?\" Observe द्वैपारायणिकः ॥\n\nThe _Dvigu_ compound with the sense of a _Taddhita_ affix is formed under (II. 1. 51). The affix will not, therefore, be elided where it does not give rise to a _Dvigu_ compound. Thus पञ्चकपालस्येदं = पाञ्चकपालम् ॥ Or the genitive case in द्विगोः may be taken as _sthana_-_shashthi_, the sense being 'there is the substitution of लुक्-elision in the room of _Dvigu_,' the word _Dvigu_ being here taken by metonymy for the affix which gives rise to _Dvigu_. Of course, when two words have blended into a _Dvigu_ compound, the affixes will not be elided after such a word, because it becomes a _pratipadika_ like others, as पांचकपालम् ॥ If so, how is the affix elided in पञ्चकपाल्याम् संस्कृतः = पञ्चकपालः ?This is not so; there is no _Taddhita_ added, and the word पञ्चकपाल can never be analysed into पञ्चकपाल्याम् संस्कृतः, ॥ If the latter sense is to be expressed, we must use a sentence, and no single word. In fact three are the only valid forms, and they arise without adding of any _Taddhita_ affix to पञ्चकपाली, viz पञ्चसु कपालेषु संस्कृतः, पञ्चकपाल्लयां संस्कृतः, and पञ्चकपालः (a _Samahara_ _Dvigu_). A _Samahara_ and a _Taddhitartha_ _Dvigu_ of these are analysed in the same way, while the third पञ्चकपाल्याम् संस्कृतः will always remain a वाक्य and never give rise to a _Taddhita_.\n\nHow do you explain the non-elision of the affix in त्रैविद्यः, पाञ्चनदः and षाट्कुलः ? The word त्रैविद्यः does not mean तिस्रो विद्या अधीते but त्र्यवयवा विद्या, त्रिविद्या, त्रिविद्यामधीते = त्रैविद्यः ॥ Similarly पाञ्चनदः does not mean पञ्चसु नदीषु भवः but पंचानाम् नदीनाम् समाहारः = पंचनदः, पंचनदे भवः = पांचनदः ॥ So also with षाट्कुलं ॥\n\nWhy the affix is not elided in पंचभ्यो गर्गेभ्य आगतं = पंचगर्गरूप्यम् or पंचगर्गमयम् ? Because the elision of those affixes only take place which begin with a vowel.",
    "41089": "Thus the plural of गार्ग्य is गर्गाः (II. 4. 64). But the disciples of गर्गाः will be formed by the affix छ (IV. 21. 114) which is a _pragdivyatiya_ affix and for the purposes of adding this affix the base will be considered to be गार्ग्यः as if there was no elision. Thus गार्ग्याः + छ = गार्गीयाः (VII. 1. 2) and (VI. 4. 151), and not गर्गीयाः । Similarly वात्सीयाः, आत्रयीयाः, खारपायणीयाः 'disciples of _Vatsyas_, _Atreyas_, _Kharpayanas_.'\n\nWhy do we say \"गोत्रे\" i. e. \"when the _Gotra_ affix is elided\"? Observe कौबलम्, बादरम् ॥ Here the affix denoting \"fruit\" is elided by लुक् by _Sutra_ (IV. 3. 163). Then when the _pragdivytiya_ affix अण् is added, the _luk_-elision is maintained. Thus the fruit of बदरी is बदरम्; from which बादरम् 'belonging to or coming from the jujube-fruit.'\n\nWhy do we say \"having an initial vowel\"? Observe गर्गेभ्य आगतम् = गर्गरूप्यम् and not गार्गरूप्यम्; and गर्गमयम्; and not गार्गमयम् ॥ Here the affix रूप्य, a _pragdivyatiya_ affix taught in _sutra_ (IV. 3. 81) does not begin with a vowel; therefore it is added to गर्ग and not गार्ग्य ॥ Similarly the next affix मयट् (IV. 3. 82).\n\nWhy do we say \"when it has the sense of a _pragdivyatiya_ affix\" ? Thus गर्गेभ्यो हितम् = गर्गीयम् 'who is fit for the _Gargas_'. Here the affix छ (V. 1. 1) has the sense of 'suitable for that', as taught in _Sutra_ (V. I. 5) not one of the _pragdivyatiya_ senses. Hence the _luk_ elision is maintained.\n\nThe _Gotra_-affixes are taught to be elided in the plural only: and when after such supposed elision a Singular or Dual Person is intended, this rule will still apply and there will be no elision. Thus बिद will form its _Gotra_ derivative by अञ् (IV. 1. 104) as बिद + अञ् = बैदः ॥ The plural of बैद will be बिदाः by the elision of अञ् ॥ One _yuvan_ or two _yuvan_ descendants of these बिदाः will be formed by the affix इञ् (IV. 1. 95), for the application of which the word बिदाः will be supposed not to have lost its अञ्, therefore इञ् will be added to बैद, thus बैद + इञ्; then this इञ् is elided by (II. 4. 58). The resultant form is बैदः, बैदो ॥ The many descendants (in the plural) of one बैदः or two बैदः will be बिदाः ॥",
    "41090": "The elision of the _Yuvan_ affix must take place mentally; having done which, we should then look out for the proper _Pragdivyatiya_ affix to be added to the word-form thus remaining. Thus the Patronymic (¬_Gotra_) of फाण्टाहृतः is फाण्टाहृतिः (IV. 1.95) formed by adding इञ् ॥ The _Yuvan_ form of the latter (by _Sutra_ (IV. 1. 150)) will be फाण्टाहृतः  ॥ When we intend to add a _Pragdivyatiya_ affix to this last word, (e. g. an affix having the sense of \"the pupils of\";) we should first mentally elide the _Yuvan_ affix ण (IV. 1. 150) from this word फाण्टाहृत ॥ Having done which we get the form फाण्टाहृति; and it is with regard to this form फाण्टाहृति that we should search out what is the proper pupil-denoting affix: and that by _sutra_ (IV. 2. 112) is अण् ॥ Thus फाण्टाहृति + अण् = फाण्टाहृताः 'the pupils of _Phantahritas_'. Had we in the first instance applied the pupil denoting affix to the _Yuvan_ word फाण्टाहृत, such affix would have been छ and not अण्, for the latter is ordained for those cases only where the word ends with the _Gotra_ affix इञ् (IV. 2. 112).\n\nSimilarly the Patronymic of भागवित्त is भागवित्ति (IV. 1. 25). The _Yuvan_ of भागवित्ति is भागवित्तिकः (IV. 1. 148). The pupils of _Bhagavittika_ will be भागवित्ताः by adding the affix अण् (IV. 2. 112).\n\nSimilarly the Patronymic of तिक is तैकायनि formed by फिञ् (IV. 1. 154). The _Yuvan_ of तैकायनि is तैकायनीय formed by the affix छ (IV. 1. 149). The word denoting the pupils of तैकायनीय will be formed by adding छ (IV. 2. 114) not to this word, but to तैकायनि ॥ Thus तैकायनीयाः ॥\n\nSimilarly the Patronymic of कपिञ्जलाद is कपिञ्जलादिः (IV. 1. 95). The _Yuvan_ derivative of the latter will be कापिञ्जलाद्य; (IV. I. 151). The word denoting pupils of the कापिञ्जलाद्य will be कापिञ्जलादाः (IV. 2. 112).\n\nSimilarly Patronymic from ग्लुचुक is ग्लुचुकायनिः (IV. 1. 160), the _Yuvan_ of the latter is ग्लौचुकायनः (IV. 1. 83); the word denoting the pupils of the latter is ग्लौचुकायनाः by (IV. 2. 112 formed from ग्लुचुकायनि) ॥ Why do we say \"an affix beginning with a vowel\"? Observe फाण्टाहृतरूप्यम् and फाण्टाहृतमयम् ॥ Why do we say \"a _Pragdivyatiya_ affix\"? Observe भागवित्तिकाय हितं = भागावित्तीयम् ॥ (See the last _Sutra_).",
    "41091": "By the last _sutra_, all _Yuvan_ affixes were told to be elided. The present _sutra_ declares an option in the case of the _Yuvan_ affixes फक् and फिञ्. Thus the patronymic of गर्ग is गार्ग्य (IV. 1. 105); the _Yuvan_ of गार्ग्य is formed by फक् (IV. 1. 101) गार्ग्यायणः ॥ The word denoting the pupils of _Gargyana_ will be गार्गीय or गार्ग्यायणीयाः; वात्सीयाः or वात्सयायनीयाः ॥ Similarly of the affix फिञ् (IV. 1. 156). Thus from यस्क, the Patronymic is यास्क (IV. 1. 112). The _Yuvan_ of the latter is यास्कायनि (IV. 1. 146). The pupils of _Yaskayani_ will be called यास्कीया or यास्कायनीयाः ॥",
    "41092": "This _sutra_ points out the meaning of the affixes; and it refers to the affixes that have preceded, beginning from अण् (IV. 1. 83) e. g. अण्, ण्य, अञ् &c and to the affixes that follow. The affixes herein taught have the force of denoting descendant, when they are added to the word in construction which is in the genitive case. The translation given by Dr. Ballantyne of this aphorism is :- \"Let the affixes already mentioned or to be mentioned come optionally in the sense of the offspring thereof, after what word ending with the sixth case-affix and having completed its junction (with whatever it may require to be compounded with), is in grammatical relation there to\".\nThus we may either use the sentence उपगोरपत्यम्; or by adding आण् (IV. 1. 83) to the word उपगु (which has the 6th. case-affix in construction in the above sentence), form औपगवः \"the offspring of _Upagu_\". आश्वपतः (IV. 1. 84) 'the offspring of अश्वपति', दैत्यः (IV. 1. 85) 'the offspring of _Diti_' औत्सः (IV. 1. 86) \"the offspring of _Utsa_\". स्त्रैणः (IV. 1. 87) 'the offspring of a woman'. पौस्नः (IV. 1. 87) 'the offspring of a man'. \n\nThe Universal _sutra_ तस्येदम् (IV. 3. 120) will include this अपत्य also for the word इदम् may be applied to any-thing like अपत्यं, समूहः, विकारः, निवासः &c. Since by that rule (IV. 3. 120) अण् &c, may be applied in the sense of _apatyam_ also, what is the necessity of this present _sutra_ ? The present _sutra_ is made in order to debar those affixes like छ, (IV. 3. 114) which debar the affix अण् &c in the case of तस्येदम् ॥ How can an अशैषिक affix debar a शैषिक affix? The उत्सर्ग affixes अण् &c are treated like शैषिक for this purpose. Thus these affixes अण् (IV. 1. 83)- (IV. 1. 87) debar the छ in the _Vriddham_ under certain circumstances. Thus भानोरपत्यं = भानवः, so also श्यामगवः from श्यामगुः (श्यामा गावोऽस्य) ॥\n\n_Karika_\n\nतस्येदमित्यपत्येपि बाधनार्थं कृतं भवेत् ।\nउत्सर्गः शेष एवासौ वृद्धान्यस्य प्रयोजनम् ॥",
    "41093": "The word _Gotra_ is defined in _Sutra_ (IV. 1. 152) and means the offspring beginning with the grandson. There would have arisen the application of a separate affix in denoting the descendant of every one of such persons; the present _sutra_ declares a restriction. Thus the son of गर्गः is गार्गि (IV. 1. 95). The son of गार्गिः (or in other words the grandson of गर्ग) is गार्ग्यः (IV. 1. 105). This is formed by a _Gotra_ affix. Now the son of गार्ग्यः will also be called गार्ग्यः, no new affix will be added. In fact, in denoting the _Gotra_ descendants how low soever, the affix यञ् will be added to the word गर्ग, though there may be several intermediate descendants. Thus the _sutra_ restricts the application of the affix. Or in another view of the matter, it may be said to restrict the base to which the affix is to be added. Thus the son of गार्ग्य will be formed by adding the affix यञ् not to the base गार्ग्य (which would have been the case were (IV. 1. 92) strictly applied), but to the base गर्ग ॥ So that one base is to be taken and adhered to throughout, in applying _Gotra_ affixes.",
    "41094": "This is also a _niyama_ or restrictive rule. Thus the _Yuvan_ of गार्ग्य is गार्ग्यायणः (IV. 1. 101). Similarly वात्स्यायणः, दाक्षायणः, प्लाक्षायणः, औपगविः, नाडायनिः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"but in the Feminine the word is not termed _Yuvan_\"? Observe दाक्षी which is the feminine of दाक्षिः (_Gotra_) as well as of दाक्षायणः (_Yuvan_). Similarly प्लाक्षी feminine of प्लाक्षिः and प्लाक्षायणः ॥ In short, _Yuvan_ affixes are not added in the feminine. If it is intended to denote a feminine descendant of the kind _Yuvan_, the feminine word formed by _Gotra_ affix will denote such a descendant also.\n\nWhat is here prohibited i. e. is the term _Gotra_ superseded by the term _Yuvan_? If it is a _niyama_ rule, there will be no _niyama_ with regard to the feminine, as the prohibition is contained in the same sentence. Therefore in the feminine, the _Yuvan_ affix will not get the designation of _Gotra_, because _Gotra_-name is debarred by _Yuvan_ Name. Therefore the _sutra_ should be divided in two, e. g. गोत्राद् यूनि प्रत्ययो भवति (2) ततोऽस्त्रियाम् ॥ (1) After a _Gotra_ formed word a new affix is added in denoting a _Yuvan_ descendant, (2) but not so in the feminine. In fact the name _Yuvan_ is prohibited in the feminine, therefore, the feminine will be known _Gotra_ always and never by _Yuvan_.",
    "41095": "This debars अण् (IV. 1. 83). Thus दक्षस्यापत्यं = दाक्षिः 'descendant of _Daksha_'. Why do we say short अ (for this is the force of the letter त् added to अ, by (I. 1. 69) and (I. 1. 70)? The descendant of शुभंयाः or कीलालपाः (words which end in long आ) will not be formed by the affix इञ् ॥\n\nThe descendant of दशरथ by this _sutra_ is दाशरथिः, but the form दाशरथ formed by अण् is also met with.

Thus the son of a private person called बाहु will be बाहवः ॥\n\nVart:- The operations to be effected upon words denoting relation are prohibited with regard to the same word-forms when denoting Proper Names. Thus the offspring of श्वशुर meaning 'father-in-law' is श्वशुर्यः, but when it means a person called _Svasura_, then the derivative will be श्वाशुरिः ॥\n\nThe च in the _sutra_ indicates that other words not included in the list also take this affix.

    "41098": "This debars इञ् ॥ Of the affix च्फञ् the letter ञ् is for the sake of distinguishing this affix from the affix फञ्; such as in _sutra_ (V. 3. 113), by which the words ending in affix च्फञ् take the further affix य (ञ्य), in order to form a complete word. The letter ञ् of this affix causes _Vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 117). Then remains फ् which by _sutra_ (VII. 1. 2), is replaced by आयन् ॥ Thus कुञ्ज + च्फञ् = कौञ्ज + आयन् + अ = कौञ्जायन. This is not a complete word as yet. We must add य by _sutra_ (V. 3. 113). Thus the full word is कौञ्जायन्यः 'the grandson or a lower descendant of _Kunja_' dual of it is कौञ्जायन्यौ, plural is कौञ्जायनाः; the affix ञ्य being elided by (II. 5. 62), in the plural, it being an affix of the तद्राज class (IV. 1. 174). Similarly ब्राध्रायन्यः, ब्राध्रायन्यौ, ब्राध्रायनाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when a _Gotra_ descendant is to be denoted?\" Observe कौंजिः \"the son of _Kunja_\". Here इञ् is added by (IV. 1. 95) in denoting immediate descendant. There is difference in the accent of these words, in the different numbers. Thus in the singular and dual, the accent will be regulated by the latter ञ् of the affix ञ्य which is added in those numbers. But this affix being elided in the plural, the accent there will be regulated by the letter च of च्फञ् ॥ That is to say, in the singular and dual, the _udatta_ will fall on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197); in the plural, it will fall on the last syllable (VI. 1. 164).\n\nThe word गोत्रे of this _sutra_ governs the succeeding _sutras_ up to aphorism (IV. 1. 112): so that all the affixes taught in these fifteen _sutras_ denote grandsons or descendants lower than that.\n\n1 कुञ्ज, 2 ब्रध्र, 3 शङ्ख, 4 भस्मन्, 5 गण, 6 लोमन्, 7 शत, 8 शाक, 9 शुण्डा, 10 शुभ, 11 विपाश्, 12 स्कन्द, 13 स्कम्भ, 14 शकट, 15 शुम्भा, 16 शिव, 17 शुभंयि ॥",

Thus शालंकायनः ॥ The word शालंकिः occurs in पैलादि class (II. 4. 59), the _Yuvan_ affix is, therefore, elided after it, thus शालंकिः is a common name for 'father' and 'son'. It takes इञ् by (IV. 1. 96), as belonging to _Bahvadi_ class which is an _Akrti_-_gana_. The word अग्निशर्मन् takes फक् when denoting the वृषगण _gotra_, e.g. आग्निशर्मायणः = वार्ष्यगण्यः; otherwise the form will be आग्निशर्मः ॥ The word कृष्ण will form कार्ष्णायनः when a _Brahmana_ is meant; otherwise कार्ष्णिः, so also राणायनः = वासिष्ठः, otherwise राणिः ॥ The word क्रोष्टु is changed to क्रोष्ट as क्रौष्टायनः ॥\n\n1 नड, 2 चर, (वर) 3 बक, 4 मुंज, 5 इतिक, 6 इतिश, 7 उपक, 8 एक, 9 लमक । 10 शलंकु शलङ्कं च । 11 सप्तल, 12 वाजप्य, 13 तिक । 14 अग्निशर्मन्वृषगणे । 15 प्राण 16 नर, 17 सायक, 18 दास, 19 मित्र, 20 द्वीप, 21 पिङ्गर, 22 पिङ्गल, 23 किंकर, 24 किङ्कल, 25 कातर, 26 कातल, 27 काश्यप (कुश्यप) 28 काश्य, 29 काल्य (काव्य) 30 अज, 31 अमुष्य (अमुष्म) 32 कृष्णरणौ ब्राह्मणवासिष्ठे । 33 अमित्र, 34 लिगु, 35 चित्र, 36 कुमार, 37 क्रोष्टु क्रोष्टं च । 38 लोहं, 39 दुर्ग, 40 स्तम्भ, 41 शिंशफा, 42 अग्र, 43 तृण, 44 शकट, 45 सुमनस, 46 सुमत, 47 मिमत, 48 ऋच, 49 जलंधर, 50 अध्वर, 51 युगंधर, 52 हंसक, 53 दण्डिन्, 54 हस्तिन्, 55 पिण्ड, 56 पंचाल, 57 चमसिन्, 58 सुकृत्य, 59 स्थिरक, 60 ब्राह्मण, 61 चटक, 62 बदर, 63 अश्वल, 64 खरप, 65 लङ्क, 66 इन्ध, 67 अस्र, 68 कामुक, 69 ब्रह्मदत्त, 70 उदुम्बर, 71 शोण, 72 अलोह, 73 दण्डप, 74 जत्, 75 अश्वक, 76 वानष्य, 77 नाव्य, 78 अन्वजत, 79 अन्तजन, 80 इत्वरा, 81 अंशक, 82 याम, 83 काम, 84 वात ॥",

Thus हारित + फक् = हारितायनः \"the son of _Harita_ or the great-grandson of _Harita_\". In fact, the force of the affix फक् of this _Sutra_ is that of a _Yuvan_ affix, though it is taught in the chapter of _Gotra_ affixes; because according to the general rule (IV. 1. 98) one _Gotra_ affix can be only added to a word, and the word हारित that being already formed by a _Gotra_ affix अञ् will not take again another _Gotra_ affix फक् ॥ Therefore, फक् as is here a _Yuvan_-affix.",

Thus the affix यञ् is added by (IV. 3. 10) to denote proximity to a sea. As द्वीप + यञ् = द्वैप्यः ॥ This word will not take the affix फक् ॥ Similarly by (IV. 2. 80) the affix इञ् is added to the words सुतंगम &c, the force of the affix being चातुरर्थिक ॥ Thus सौतंगमिः.

How is then अश्वत्थामा the son of _Drona_, called द्रौणायनः and not द्रौणिः in the phrase \"अश्वत्थामा द्रौणायनः\"? The द्रोण here does not refer to the _Drona_ of the _Mahabharat_, but to some ancient founder of a clan of that name, and his descendants were called द्रौणायनाः ॥ In modern times, by an easy error, _Asvatthama_ was called _Draunayana_, owing to the similarity of sounds.",

When the affix अञ् is added to these words, it has the force of denoting immediate descendant. Thus पुत्र + अञ् = पौत्रः 'grand-son.' दुहितृ + अञ् = दौहित्रः 'daughter's son.' But when added to other words which express the names of _Rishis_, the affix अञ् makes the _Gotra_ descendants. Thus बिद + अञ् = बैदः 'the grandson or a descendant lower than that of _Bida_.'\n\nHow in a context relating to _Gotra_ affixes, we come to this two fold meaning of this _sutra_? To this we reply, that the phrase अनृष्यानन्तर्ये should be thus construed. The word '_anrishi_' is in the ablative case, the case affix being elided. The word आनन्तर्य is the same as अनन्तर the affix ष्यङ् being added without change of significance. Therefore the words like पौत्र &c. denote the immediate (_anantara_) descendant of पुत्र &c, and do not denote a remote descendant (_gotra_), nor a descendant in general. Therefore, the above phrase means :- 'after a _Bidadi_ word which is not the name of a _Rishi_, the affix '_an_' is added in denoting an immediate descendant.'\n\nQ. Another way of explaining the phrase is this, the word '_anantarya_' is equal to'_nairantarya_' = 'uninterrupted succession.' Therefore, where there is an uninterrupted succession of _Rishis_ between the first name and the person to be designated by a Patronymic, there the affix '_an_' will not be added. Thus the word कश्यप, belongs to the _Bidadi_ class. '_Indrabhu_' a seventh descendant of _Kasyapa_, will not be denoted by काश्यप formed with अञ्, because between इन्द्रभू and कश्यप, there is an unbroken series of _Rishis_, but by अण् of (IV. 1. 114). Therefore the following phrase will be valid इन्द्रभूः सप्तमः काश्यपानाम् ॥ For अञ् is elided in the plural by (II. 4. 64), but काश्यपानाम् is plural of  काश्यप formed with the general patronymic अण् of (IV. 1. 114) and hence not elided.\n\nA. This explanation is not to be preferred, merely in order to explain the word काश्यपानाम् in इन्द्रभूः सप्तमः काश्यपानाम् ॥ The general Patronymic ऋषि affix अण् of (IV. 1. 114) is not debarred by this अञ् ॥ Therefore काश्यप with अञ् will denote इन्द्रभूः, which may also be denoted by काश्यप formed with अण् ॥ For had the above explanation been correct, then विश्वामित्र the grandson of _Kusika_ could never be called कौशिकः (formed with अञ्), for both _Gadhi_ the father of _Visvamitra_, and _Kusika_ the grand-father were _Rishis_.\n\nIn denoting an immediate descendant or a descendant in general, the _Rishi_ words बिद &c, will take other appropriate affixes. Thus बिद forms बैदि 'a descendant of _Bida_' by (IV. 1. 96) इञ् and not by ऋष्यण् of (IV. 1. 114), because बिद is supposed to belong to the _Akrtigana_ of _Bahvadi_.\n\n1 बिद, 2 उर्व, 3 कश्यप, 4 कुशिक, 5 भरद्वाज, 6 उपमन्यु, 7 किलात, 8 कन्दर्प (किंदर्भ) 9 विश्वानर, 10 ऋषिषेण (ऋष्टिशेण) 11 ऋतभाग, 12 हर्यश्व, 13 प्रियक, 14 आपस्तम्ब, 15 कूचवार, 16 शरद्वत्, 17 शुनक (शुनक्), 18 धेनु, 19 गोपवन, 20 शिग्रु, 21 बिन्दु, 22 भोगक, 23 भाजन, 24 शमिक, 25 अश्वावतान, 26 श्यामाक, 27 श्यानक, 28 दयावलि, 29 श्यापर्ण, 30 हरित, 31 किंदास, 32 बह्यस्क, 33 अर्कजूष (अर्कलूक) 34 बध्योग, 35 विष्णु, 36 बुद्ध, 37 प्रतिबोध, 38 रचित, 39 रथीतर (रथन्तर) 40 गविष्ठिर, 41 निषाद, 42 शबर, 43 अलस, 44 मठर, 45 मृडाकु, 46 सृपाकु, 47 मृदु, 48 पुनर्भू, 49 पूत्र, 50 दुहितृ, 51 ननान्दृ, 52 परस्त्री परशुं च । 53 किलालप, 54 सम्बक्, 55 श्यायक ॥\n\nThe word परस्त्री in the above list is replaced by परशु when taking the affix अञ् ॥ Thus परस्त्रिया अपत्यं = पारशवः (the son of a _Brahmana_ begotten on a _Sudra_ woman, who though married to the _Brahmana_ is परस्त्री 'a strange woman' owing to the great difference of race).\n\nThe word परस्त्री occurs in अनुशतिकादि (VII. 3. 20) and कल्याण्यादि (IV. 1. 126) classes also. Therefore when the sense is 'a son begotten on another's wife' who is also called परस्त्री, the form will be पारस्त्रैणेयः, with double _vriddhi_ of both members by (VII. 3. 20): which does not take place in the case of पारशवः ॥",

The present _sutra_ declares a restriction, viz. बभ्रु takes यञ् only then when कौशिक is denoted. Its being read in the _Gargadi_ class serves another purpose : as it belongs to the sub-class लोहितादि, the rule (IV. 1. 18) becomes applicable to it; so that its feminine is formed by ष्फ. Thus बाभ्रव्यायणी ॥ In fact, it would have been better, if in the body of the _Ganapatha_, instead of writing बभ्रु alone, there was बभ्रु कौशिके ॥ It would have saved the repetition of it in the present _sutra_.",

The present _sutra_ declares a restriction i. e. the '_yan_' is to be applied only when _Angirasa_ descendant is meant. It is included in the _Gargadi_ class also for the purpose of applying (IV.

It would have taken both affixes अञ् and अण्. The present _sutra_ declares that when it means an _Angirasa_, then वतण्ड will not take अण् of the शिवादि class : and when it does not mean _Angirasa_, then it takes both these affixes e. g. वातंड्यः and वातंडः any descendant of _Vatanda_.",

When वतण्ड takes अण् under _Sivadi_ class, its feminine is वातण्डी ॥ Though the word is formed with अण् yet in the feminine, there is not ष्यङ् substitution (IV. 1. 78), because _Vatanda_ is a _Rishi_-Name.",

Similarly आश्मायनः There are some words in this class which already have taken a patronymic affix, e.g, आत्रेय, वैल्य, and आनडुह्य ॥ After these words the affix फञ् of course has the force of a _Yuvan_ affix. The word आत्रेय is formed by त्रि + ढक् (IV. 1. 122), वैल्य = विलि (a _Rajarshi_) + ञ्यङ् (IV. 1 171), and आनडुह्य = अमडुह + यञ् (IV. 1. 105). The word शय takes _phan_ only when it denotes an _Atreya_, as शायायनः, otherwise शायिः with इञ् or शायः with अण् ॥ The word जात takes '_phan_' only when the offspring of a male is to be denoted, as जातस्यापत्यं = जातायनः but जाताया अपत्यं = जातेयः with ढक् ॥ The word आत्रेय takes '_phan_' when denoting a _Bharadvaja_, as आत्रेयायनः, otherwise it will take the affix इञ्, which will be elided by (II. 4. 28), leaving the form आत्रेयः ॥\n\nThe words भरद्वाज आत्रेये of the above list mean that when a person born in _Atri_ _Gotra_ is adopted by a person belonging to _Bharadvaja_ _Gotra_, then the affix is to be added, he of course is an _Atreya_ but gets a new _Gotra_ of _Bharadvaja_.

The word अवृद्धाभ्यः shows the orthography of the word to which the affix is to be added. The word नदीमानुषीभ्यः declares the meaning of that word and both attributes refer to one and the same base, i.e. orthographically the base should have a _Vriddhi_ letter in the first syllable, and etymologically it should denote a man or a river.

To this, some reply that _Panini_ has by mere coincidence (and not as cause and effect) classified certain definite number of words as belonging to certain families, and then the rule made applicable to them. Moreover a permanent object is sometimes designated by an impermanent object : as the permanent time is designated by the name of _Saka_.

    "41127": "The word कुलटा means literally one who wanders (अटति) from one family (कुल) to another, i.e. an unchaste woman. This _sutra_ is made to teach substitution only, for कुलटा would have taken ढक् by the general rule (IV. I. 120). Thus कुलटा + ढक् = कुलटिन् + ढक् = कौलटिनेयः or कौलटेयः 'son of an unchaste woman.' This word कुलटा being a word denoting contempt, will take also the affix ढक् by (IV. 1. 131). Thus कौलटेरः ॥",

Thus the female descendant of चटका will be चटका, the टाप् being added as belonging to _Ajadi_ class (IV. 1. 4).",
    "41129": "Thus गोधा + ढ्रक् = गौधेरः ॥ Of the affix '_dhrak_', the letter ढ् is replaced by एय् (VII. 1. 2), क् causes _Vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 118) and makes the _udatta_ accent fall on the final (IV. 1. 165). Thus the real affix is एय्र, but the य् is elided by (VI. 1. 66) and so the affix that is actually added is एर ॥\n\nThis word गोधा occurs in the _Subhradi_ class (IV. I. 123), also, thus it takes the affix '_dhak_' as well. Thus गौधेयः ॥",
    "41130": "Thus गौधारः ॥ It might be objected that the आरक् contains the letter आ unnecessarily, for रक् would have served the purpose as well, because गोधा ends in long आ already. The objection is valid in the case of गोधा, but the very fact that _Panini_ uses this affix आरक्, shows by implication, that there are other words also which take this affix, and in whose case the affix रक् would not suffice. Thus the words जड and पण्ड also take this affix, as जाडारः, पाण्डारः ॥ The mention of the name of Northern Grammarians is for the sake of showing respect only.",
    "41131": "The _anuvritti_ of ढ्रक् is to be read in this _sutra_, and not of आरक्, though the latter immediately precedes it. The word क्षुद्रा means those who are defective or wanting in any bodily limb or organ, or who are low in social status and religious principles. This _sutra_ debars ढक् which would come in the other alternative. Thus काणेरः 'the son of an one eyed woman', or काणेयः, दासेरः or दासेयः 'son of a female-slave'.",
    "41132": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus पितृष्वसृ + छण् = पैतृष्वस्रीयः 'the son of the father's sister'. The छ of the affix is replaced by ईय ॥",

    "41135": "This debars अण् &c. Thus कमण्डलु + ढञ् = कामण्डलेयः (IV. 4. 147), the उ being elided before ढ)). So also शौतिबोहयेः and जाम्बयः from शितिबाहु and जम्बु ॥",
    "41136": "This debars अण् and ढक् &c. Thus गार्ष्टेयः, हार्ष्टेय ॥ The word गृष्टि when it means 'a cow' will of course get the affix ढञ् by the last _Sutra_.

    "41137": "This debars अण् and अञ् respectively. Thus राजन्यः (IV. 4. 168) 'a person of _Kshatriya_ class'. This is the special meaning of the word; it does not mean 'the son of a _Raja_.' The word राजनः will mean 'the son of a King.' So also श्वशुरर्यः 'son of the father-in-in-law.'",
    "41138": "Thus क्षत्रियः 'a _Kshatriya_.' This is also a class name. The son of क्षत्र will be क्षात्रिः ॥ The affix घ here should not be confounded with the technical घ which means the affixes तरप् and तमप् (1. 1. 22).",
    "41139": "In the next _sutra_, it will be taught that the word कुल when not preceded by any other word, takes the affixes '_yat_' and '_dhakan_.' That indicates by implication that the present _sutra_ applies to the simple word कुल and to the words ending in कुल also. Thus कुलीनः, आढ्यकुलीनः, श्रोत्रियकुलीनः ॥",
    "41140": "The word अपूर्वपद means when the word '_kula_' is not the last member of a compound. Thus कुल्यः , कौलेयकः ॥ By the use of the word 'optionally,' we get the affix ख also. Thus कुलीनः ॥ The word कु꣡ल्यः has _udatta_ on the first syllable (VI. I. 213).\n\nThe word पद has been defined in (l. 4. 14). The word बहु is not a _pada_. Therefore बहुकुल will take these affixes. Thus बहुकुल्यः , बाहुकुलेयकः and बहुकुलीनः ॥",
    "41141": "Thus माहाकुलः, माहाकुलीनः and महाकुलीनः ॥ The last is formed by the affix ख of (IV. 1. 139).",

    "41144": "By the force of the word च in the _sutra_, we get the affix छ as well.\n\nThis debars अण् ॥ Thus भ्रातृव्यः or भ्रात्रीयः 'the brother's son'. The त् of व्यत् the regulates the accent, making it _svarita_.",
    "41145": "The word सपत्न means 'enemy'. The sense of descendant is not connoted by this affix. The difference between व्यन् and व्यत् is in accent (VI. 1. 185) and (VI. I. 197). Thus पाप्मना भ्रातृव्येण \"by the sinful enemy\". भ्रातृव्यः कण्टकः \"the enemy is a thorn\".",
    "41146": "This of course debars ढक् &c. Thus रेवती + ठक् = रैवतिकः 'the son of _Revati_'. So also आश्वपालिकः (VII. 3. 50)\n\n1 रेवती, 2अश्वपाली, 3 मणिपाली, 4 द्वारपाली, 5 वृकवञ्चिन्, 6 वृकबन्धु, 7 वृकग्राह, 8 कर्णग्राह, 9 दण्डग्राह, 10 कुक्कूटाक्ष, 11 (ककुदाक्ष) 12 चामरग्राह,",
    "41147": "By the force of the word च in the _sutra_ we get the affix ठक् also. When one's father is not known, and he is called by a name derived from his mother, it casts a slur upon his legitimacy; hence such an epithet is a कुत्सा or 'a defamatory or contemptuons epithet'. Thus गार्गी is a female _gotra_-descendant. Her son will be called गार्गः, as गार्गः जाल्मः ॥ So also गार्गिकः ॥ Similarly the son of ग्लुचुकायनी will be ग्लौचुकायनः and ग्लौचुकायनिकः ॥\n\nThis affix being added to a _Gotra_ word has the force of a _Yuvan_ affix.\n\nWhy do we say 'a _Gotra_ descendant'. Observe कारिकेयो जाल्मः (formed by ढक् (IV. 1. 120)). Why do we say 'female descendant'? Observe औपगवि जाल्मः ॥ Why do we say 'when contempt is meant'? Observe गार्गेयो माणवकः which is to be explained as गार्ग्या अपत्यं पुमान् युवा भवति ॥ मातामहादेरुपलक्षणार्थोयं प्रयोग इति नास्ति कुत्सा ॥",

So also तार्णबिन्दविकः formed from तृणबिन्दु + अण् (IV. 1. 83) तार्णबिन्दवः, and then adding ठक् ॥ In the alternative we have the affix फक् (IV. 1. 101) as भागवित्तायनः, so also तार्णबिन्दविः ॥ The word अकशाप belongs to _Subhradi_ class (IV. 1. 123): and forms आकशापेयः, his son will be आकशापेयिकः or आकशापेयिः ॥ Of course, when contempt is not expressed, we have to भागवित्तायनः only.\n\nThe operation of this _sutra_ is, in fact, confined to the three words भागवित्ति, तार्णबिन्दव, and आकशापेय as given in the _karika_.\n\nQ. What is the necessity of using the word '_Vrddha_' in the _sutra_, for the _anuvritti_ of the word '_gotra_' is understood in the _sutra_, and a _Sauvira_ class Nominal-stem formed with a _Gotra_ affix will necessarily have a _Vrddhi_ letter in its first syllable? The word _Vrddha_ is employed in the _sutra_ to stop the _anuvritti_ of स्त्रियाः; for had '_Vrddha_' not been used, then with the _anuvritti_ of गोत्र from the last _sutra_, there would have come the _anuvrtti_ of स्त्रियाः also, but by using '_Vriddha_' the _anuvrtti_ of '_Gotra_' only is taken, and not that of '_striyah_'.\n\nWhy do we say \"of the _Sauviras_\"? Observe औपगविर्जाल्मः ॥ Why do we say 'in denoting contempt'? Observe भागवित्तायनो माणवकः ॥ Why do we say 'diversely'? The word बरुल indicates the anomalous nature of these four _sutras_ (IV. 1. 147) to (IV. 1. 150). Thus the first of these viz (IV. 1. 147) only denotes contempt, the last of these viz (IV. 1. 150), denotes '_Sauvira_' only and not contempt; whilst the middle two namely (IV. I. 148) and (IV. 1. 189) denote both 'contempt' and '_Sauvira_'.",

The son of _Yamundayani_ will be either यमुन्दायनीयः or यामुन्दायनिकः ॥\n\nBut when contempt is not to be expressed, the son of यामुन्दायनिः will be यामुन्दायनिः ॥ Thus यामुन्दायनि + अण् = यामुन्दायनि + o (Il. 4. 58) = यामुन्दायनिः ॥\n\nSo also when persons of _Suvira_ country are not meant, छ is not added. Thus तैकायनिः ॥\n\nThe फेः of the _sutra_ refers to फिञ् and not to फिन्, for a stem formed by फिन् will not have a _Vriddhi_ letter in the first syllable and will not be called '_Vriddham_'; and the _anuvritti_ of this word is understood in the _sutra_.\n\nAccording to the _Karika_, three फिञन्त stems, all belonging to _Tikadi_ class, are only governed by this _sutra_ viz यमुन्द, सुयामा and वार्ष्यायणिः ॥ The son of वृष is _Varshyayani_.",
    "41150": "This debars फक् । By the rule of composition in (11. 2. 34), the word मिमत consisting of less syllables than फाण्टाहृत, ought to have been placed first. Its not being placed first in this _sutra_ indicates, that _Sutra_ (1. 3. 10) does not apply here. So that both the affixes ण and फिञ् are applied to each of these words, and not one to each respectively, Thus फाण्टाहृतः or फाण्टाहृतायनिः, मैमतः or मैमतायनिः ॥\n\nWhen not denoting _Sauvira_ _Gotras_, we have फाण्टाहृतायनः and मैमतायनः (by फक् ॥ See (IV. 1. 101) and (IV. 1. 99)). The word मिमत belongs to _Nadadi_-class. (IV. 1. 99).",
    "41151": "Thus कुरु + ण्य = कौरव्यः ॥ So also गार्ग्यः ॥ The word कुरु takes the affix ण्य by (IV. 1. 172), so that the form कौरव्यः is evolved both under the present _sutra_ and _sutra_ (IV. 1. 172); but the difference in these two words is this. The word कौरव्य formed by the ण्य of (IV. 1. 172), loses its affix in the plural, because ण्य of (IV. 1. 172) is a _Tadraja_ affix (see (II 4. 62): but the word कौरव्य formed by the present _sutra_ retains its affix in the plural. As कौरव्यः ॥ The word कौरव्य occurs in the _Tikadi_ class (IV. 1. 154), and it takes as such the affix फिञ्. As कौरव्यायणिः ॥\n\nThe word रथकार occurs in this class and it means the caste known as _Rathakara_. _Rathakara_ is a caste a little lower than the twice-born. See _Yajnyavalkya_ _Smriti_, V. 95. But when the word रथकार means a person who makes chariots, that is an artisan, it will take the affix ण्य not by this _Sutra_, but by the succeeding _sutra_. \n\nThe word केशिनी occurs in this class. Its derivative will be कैशिन्यः ॥ There will not be _punvadbhava_ as required by (VI. 3. 34) &c. For had there been _punvadbhava_, then by भस्यढे तद्धिते, all _Bha_ bases will become _punvad_ before a _taddhita_ affix except ढ ॥ Therefore केशिनी + ण्य = केशिन् + ण्य ॥ At this stage rule (VI. 1. 144) will appear and cause the elision of टि and we shall have केश् + ण्य = कैश्य ॥ But this is not the form desired, hence the word केशिनी is read with the feminine affix in the list.\n\nThe word वेन takes this affix in the Vedic literature. Therefore, the form वैन्य in the modern Sanskrit is incorrect.\n\nThe word वामरथ occurs in this class. With the exception of accent, it is treated in every other respect like a word of _Kanvadi_ class, a subdivision of _Gargadi_ (IV. 4. 105). Thus disciples of वामरथ्यः will be formed by the affix अण् (IV. 2. 111). As वामरथ्य + अण् = वामरथः (VI. 1. 105). The plural will be वामरथाः (II. 4. 64). The feminine gender will be वामरथी (IV. 1. 16) or वामरथ्यायनी (IV. 1. 17). The _Yuvan_ will be वामरथ्यायनः (IV. 1. 101). So also it will take अण् when the sense of collection &c is expressed (IV. 3 127): as वामरथानि ॥ But as to accent, it will not be like _Kanvadi_ words, for while those words being formed by the affix यञ् will have _udatta_ on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197) the accent of वामरथ्य will be governed by ण्य ॥\n\n1 कुरु, 2 गर्गर (गर्ग), 3 मङ्गुष, 4 अजमार (अजमारक), 5 रथकार, 6 वावदूक, 7 सम्राजः क्षत्रिये, 8 कवि, 9 विमति (मति), 10 कापिञ्जलादि, 11 वाक् (or वाच्) 12 वामरथ, 13 पितृमत्, 14 इन्द्रलाजी, (इन्द्रजालि), 15 एजि, 16 वातकि, 17 दामोष्णीषि, 18 गणकारि, 19 कैशोरि, 20 कुट, 21 शलाका (शालाका), 22 सुर, 23 पुर, 24 एरका (सरक), 25 शुभ्र, 26 अभ्र, 27 दर्भ, 28 केशिनी, 29 वेनाच्छन्दसि, 30 शूपर्णाय, 31 श्यावनाय, 32 श्यावरथ, 33 श्यावपुत्र, 34 सत्यंकार, 35 वडभीकार, 36 पथिकार, 37 मूढ, 38 शकन्धु, 39 शङ्क, 40 शाक, 41 शाकिन्, 42 शालीन, 43 कर्तृ, 44 हर्तृ, 45 इन्, 46 पिण्डी (इनपिण्डी), 47 वामरथस्य कण्वादिवत्स्वरवर्जम्.

Why two are used in this _sutra_ viz.  प्राचां and बहुलं ? The mention of Grammarians is made as a token of respect, and बहुलं is used to express the non-uniformity of the _sutra_ construction. In some places this affix फिन् is not at all added, as दाक्षिः, प्लाक्षिः ॥",
    "41161": "_Karika_\n\nअपत्ये कुत्सिते मूढे मनोरौत्सर्गिकः स्मृतः ।\nनकारस्य च मूर्द्धन्यस्तेन सिद्ध्यति माणवः ॥\n\nThus मनु + षुक् + अञ् = मानुषः \"a man or man-kind\". So also मनुष्यः formed with यत् ॥ These affixes here have not the force of Patronymics, hence they are not dropped in the plural, as मानुषाः \"men\". When the descendant is to be expressed, we have the affix अण् as मनु + अण् = मानवः 'son of _Manu_', as in मानवी प्रजा ॥ So also the word माणव, there न is changed into ण and denotes the descendant of _Manu_, with the sense of contempt as well as dullness implied.",
    "41162": "When an offspring, with reference to a person, is the son's son of that person or lower than that, it is called _Gotra_. Thus the son of '_Garga_' will be गार्गिः, and the son or grandsons &c of गार्गिः with reference to _Garga_ will be गार्ग्यः ॥ Similarly वात्स्यः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'a grandson or a still lower descendant'? The immediate descendants or the son will not be called _Gotra_. Thus कौञ्जिः, गार्गिः ॥",
    "41163": "The word वंश means an uninterrupted series of family descent-or 'a line'. One who occurs in such a line, like father &c, is called वंश्य ॥ When such a _vansya_ is alive, then the descendant of a grandson &c is called _Yuvan_. The phrase पौत्रप्रभृतपत्य in the _sutra_ should be construed as पौत्रप्रभृतेर् यद् अपत्यम्. 'He who is the descendant of a grandson &c' In the last _sutra_, however, this phrase पौत्रप्रभृत्यपत्यं was properly construed by putting the word पौत्रप्रभृति in the case of apposition with अपत्यम् meaning \"a descendant being a grandson &c.\" Thus the word _Yuvan_ will be applied to a person who is at least fourth in the order of descent, from the propositus with reference to whom the derivative is made. Thus गर्गः being the head, we have गर्गः\n\n-\tअपत्यम् - गार्गिः (son or _putra_)\n-\tअपत्यम् - गार्ग्यः (_Gotra_)\n-\tअपत्यम् - गार्ग्यायणः (_Yuvan_)\n\n(if _Garga_ or _Gargi_ &c be alive). The force of the word तु, in the _sutra_ is that it will be called _Yuvan_ only, and not _Gotra_ as well.",
    "41164": "Even when a वंश्य like father &c is not alive (and a brother is not _vansya_), the younger brother gets the designation of _yuvan_, when the elder brother is alive; thus:\n\nगर्गः (dead) -> गार्गिः (dead) -> गार्ग्यः (dead) ->  गार्ग्यः, गार्ग्यायणः\n\nThe word वंश्यः is confined to ancestors like father &c, so a brother can never be a _vansya_, because he is not the source from which the other brother arises. This _sutra_ applies to cases when _Vansya_ is not meant. Thus _Gargyayna_ is the name of the younger brother with reference to the elder brother, _Gargya_; similarly _Vatsyayana_, _Dakhsayana_, and _Plakshayana_.",
    "41165": "The _sapinda_ relationship extends up to seven degrees. The word स्थविर means 'superior', and स्थविरतर is comparative and means 'more superior', that is to say, superior both by degree of descent and by age. The word जीवति is again read in this aphorism, though there is the _anuvritti_ of जीवति also from (IV. 1. 163). This जीवति of the _sutra_ qualifies the word descendant, the जीवति which is understood by context qualifies the word _sapinda_ thus :-\n\n-\t_Garga_ (dead) -> _Gargi_ (alive)\n-\t_Garga_ (dead) -> _Gargi_ (alive) -> _Gargya_ (alive)\n-\t_Garga_ (dead) -> _Gargi_ (alive) -> _Gargya_ (dead) -> _Gargyayna_) or _Gargya_ (alive)\n\nHere the uncle or the brother of a grand-father being alive, the descendant is optionally called _Yuvan_ or _Gotra_.",
    "41166": "The word _Vriddha_ is another term for _Gotra_. As तत्र भवान् गर्ग्यायणः or गार्ग्यः \"you honored _Gargyayana_ or _Gargya_\". This _sutra_ is in fact a _Vartika_  and not a _sutra_ of _Panini_. Similarly तत्र भवान् वात्स्यायनः or वात्स्यः, तत्र भवान् दाक्षायणः or दाक्षिः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when respectful reference is intended'? Observe, वात्स्यः and गार्ग्यः ॥ The definition of _Vriddham_ as given by other Grammarians is अपत्यमन्तर्हित वृद्धम् ॥",
    "41167": "Thus गार्ग्यो जाल्मः or गार्ग्यायणो जाल्मः ॥ When contempt is not intended, the only form is गार्ग्यायणः ॥ This is also a _Vartika_ and not a _sutra_.",
    "41168": "Thus पाञ्चालः 'the son of _Panchala_', so also ऐक्ष्वाकः and वैदेहः are _Kshatriyas_ who live in that country. Of course, when the word is only expressive of _Kshatriya_, but not of the name of a country, अञ् will not be used but अण्, the difference being in the accent. Thus द्रौह्यवः 'the son of '_Druhya_'; पौरवः 'the son of _Puru_.' Why do we say when it expresses _Kshatriyas_? Observe ब्राह्मणस्य पञ्चालस्यापत्यं = पाञ्चालिः, (IV. 1. 95) 'the son of _Panchala_ a _Brahmana_'; so also वैदेहिः ॥\n\nVart:- Let the same affix, which comes when the sense is that of the progeny, be added to a word denoting a country named after _Kshatriyas_, to denote the king thereof. Thus पंचालानाम् राजा = पाञ्चालः 'the king of the _Kshatriyas_ called _Panchala_ or of the country of _Panchalas_'. So also वैदेहः, 'the king of the _Kshatriyas_ or of the country of _Videha_'.\n\nThe words _Panchala_ &c. originally are names of _Kshatriya_ tribes only, secondarily they have been applied to the country inhabited by those tribes, because the _Taddhita_ affix denoting 'the country inhabited by them', is elided by (IV. 2. 81). Thus the same word पञ्चाल comes to denote the _Kshatriya_ tribe as well as the country called _Panchala_. It will make practically little difference to consider words like _Panchala_ &c. as original (not derivative) name of countries as well as of _Kshatriyas_. In fact, _Panini_ himself considers them in the same light in this _sutra_, and does not think them to be derivative words, in spite of his own _sutra_ (IV. 2. 81). Those words when denoting a country are always in the plural, as पञ्चालाः, in denoting the _Kshatriya_, they are in the singular.",
    "41169": "Both these are names of countries and denote also _Kshatriyas_ as well. Therefore, by _sutra_ (IV. 1. 171) they having a _Vriddhi_ in the first syllable, would have taken the affix 'nyan', the present _sutra_ enjoins 'an' instead. Thus साल्वेयः 'the son of _Salveya_, or the king of _Salveya_', गान्धारः 'the son of _Gandhari_ or the king of _Gandhari_?'  The _vartika_ under _Sutra_ (IV. 1. 168) given above applies here also, i.e. the affix denotes also 'the king there of'",

    "41171": "This debars अञ् ॥ Thus, to give example of _Vriddha_ words, आम्बष्ठ्यः सौवीर्यः 'the sons or kings of _Ambashtha_ and _Sauvira_'. Similarly to take words ending in short इ, we have आवन्त्यः and कौन्त्यः 'the son or kings of _Avanti_ and _Kunti_'. These are words ending in short इ ॥ So also कौसल्यः and आजाद्यः, which are neither _Vriddhas_ nor end in short इ ॥\n\nVart:- The affix '_dyan_' comes after the word '_Pandu_' when it is the name of a country as well as  _Kshatriya_ tribe. Thus पांड्यः, otherwise it will be पांडवः ॥ See (IV. 1. 74).",
    "41172": "This debars '_an_' and '_an_'. Thus कौरव्यः, नेषव्यः 'the son of _Kuru_ and _Nishadha_'. The affix denotes 'the king there of' also, as कौरव्यो राजा ॥ How do you explain the form नैषधोर्हति चेदघम् ? This is an archaic or Vedic form. How then in सनैषधस्यार्थपतेः सुतायां ? This is a poetic license.",
    "41173": "_Karika_\nउदुम्बरास्तिलखला मद्रकारा युगन्धराः ।\nभुलिङ्गाः शरदण्डाश्च साल्वावयवसंज्ञिताः ॥\"\n\nThe word साल्वा is the name of a _Kshatriya_ woman, her son will be साल्वेयः (IV. 1. 121) formed by ढक्; also साल्वः formed by अण् ॥ The dwelling place of साल्व will be also साल्वः which is the name of a country.\n\nThe sub-divisions of the country called साल्व are six, viz _Udumbarah_, _Tilakhalah_, _Madrakarah_, _Yugandharah_, _Bhulingah_ and _Saradandah_.

As प्रात्यग्रथिः, कालकूटिः and आश्मकिः ॥ The affix has the force also of 'the king there of'. As औदुम्बरो राजा ॥ According to _Mahabhashya_, the words _Busa_, _Ajamidha_, and _Ajakanda_ also take this affix, as बौसः, आजमीढिः and आजकन्दिः ॥",
    "41174": "The affixes treated of in these six _sutras_ (IV. 1. 168) to (IV. 1. 173) are called _Tadraja_. The pronoun ते refers to these only and not to all the affixes treated or before S.

    "41175": "Namely the affix अञ् which would have come after the word  कम्बोज because it denotes a country as well as a _Kshatriya_ tribe, is elided. Thus कम्बोजः 'The king of _Kamboja_'. \nIt should be stated rather 'after _Kamboja_ and the like', because we find the affix elided after '_Chola_' &c. Thus चोलः 'the king of _Cholas_'. So also केरलः शकः यवनः ॥",
    "41176": "That is to say the affix 'nyan'. (IV. 1. 171) after the word '_Avanti_' and '_Kunti_', and the affix 'nya' after the word '_Kuru_' are elided when the word to be formed is the name of a female. Thus अवन्ती, कुन्ती and कुरु 'a daughter or princess of _Avanti_, _Kunti_ of _Kuru_'. The word कुरु takes ऊङ् in the feminine by (IV. 1. 66). Why do we say 'in denoting the feminine'? Observe आवन्त्यः, कौरव्यः and कौन्त्यः ॥",
    "41177": "Thus m. शौरसेनः, f. शूरसेनी;  m. माद्रः j. मद्री ॥ The word अतः of the _sutra_ should not be construed by the rule of _tadanata_ _vidhi_ (1. 1. 72). If so construed it will mean \"a _Tadraja_ affix ending in अ is elided\". There have been taught five _Tadraja_ affixes, namely '_an_ अ)', '_an_ (अ)', 'nyan (य)', 'nya (य)' and 'in (इ)'. Of these the first four all end in अ; therefore all these four affixes should be elided in the feminine. But this is not the meaning of the author; for had it been so, there would have been no necessity of the previous _sutra_, for then the present _sutra_ would have covered the case of '_Avanti_', '_Kunti_' and '_Kuru_'. But the very fact of this _sutra_ (IV. 1. 176) indicates by ज्ञापक, that the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ does not apply here. Therefore, the feminine of आम्बष्ठ्यः is आम्बष्ठ्या, of सौवीर्यः is सौवीर्या ॥",
    "41178": "This _sutra_ debars the elision of the _Tadraja_ affix अ (required by the last _sutra_). Thus पांचाली, वैदेही, आंगी, वांगी, मागधी these being all Eastern people dwelling in countries east of the _Sarasvati_ river. Similarly of भर्ग &c. Thus भार्गी, कारुषी, कैकेयी ॥ So also of यौधेय &c.

The word यौधेय is formed by such an affix ((V. 3. 177) अञ्). The present rule, therefore indicates by implication, that the rule of elision contained in (IV. 1. 177) applies not only to the _Tadraja_ affixes taught in this chapter, but to the _Tadraja_ affixes taught in (V. 3. 112) to (V. 3. 119). Thus the _Tadraja_ affix अण् in (V. 3. 117) added to पशु &c. is elided in the feminine: e.g. m. पार्शवः, f. पर्शू, m आसुरः f असुरी--&c.\n\n1 भर्ग, 2 करूश (करूष), 3 केकय, 4 कश्मीर, 5 साल्व, 6 सुस्थाल, 7 उरस् (उरश and उरस). 8 कौरव्य.\n\n1 यौधेय, 2 कौकेय, 3 शौभ्रेय, 4 ज्याबाणेय (यावाणेय), 5 धौर्तेय (धार्तेयः धार्तेय) 6 त्रिगर्त, 7 भरत, 8 उशीनर, 9 वार्तेय ॥",

We should say श्रवणा रात्रिः and not श्चवण रात्रिः The reason is that श्रवणा is an irregularly formed word, as _Panini_ himself uses it in _sutra_ (IV. 2. 23). Why do we say 'when it is a Name or _Sanjna_'? Observe श्रावणी or आश्वत्थी रात्रिः ।",

The final अ of वामदेव would have been elided without making this affix डित्, by the rule (VI. 4. 148), then what is the use of making this affix डित्?\n\nAns. Well, the author here indicates by _jnapaka_, the existence of these two maxims of interpretation, viz. _Paribhashas_ निरनुबन्धकग्रहणे न सानुबन्धकस्य \"when a term void of _anubandhas_ is employed, it does not denote that which has an _anubandha_ attached to it\". तदनुबन्धकग्रहणे नातदनुबन्धकस्य \"when a term with one or more _anubandhas_ is employed it does not denote that which, in addition to those, has another _anubandha_ attached to it\".\n\nFor had य and यत् been only taught instead of '_dya_' and '_dyat_', then by rule (VI. 2. 156) the final of such word, with the negative particle अ, would take _udatta_ on the final, but that is not the case.

The word इति after पौर्णमासी is used for the sake of clearness. The word संज्ञायाम् does not occur in the original _sutras_ of _Panini_; but is added by a _Vartika_; and means 'if the word so formed is an appellative', i. e. if it is the name of a month, a half-month and a year. The whole _sutra_ therefore literally translated means \"the affix अण् already ordained (IV. I. 83) comes in the sense of a 7th case affix, after a word in the Ist case in construction, if that word is the name of a full-moon-night, provided that the whole word so formed is an appellation of a month, a half-month or a year\".\n\nThus पौषी पौर्णमासी अस्मिन् = पौषो मासः 'the month _Paus_ i. e. that month in which the moon is full in the asterism _Pushya_'.

The word संज्ञायाम् added to the _sutra_ by the _Vartika_ is a redundancy.\n\nThe word पौर्णमासी is formed by adding अण् to पूर्णमास ॥ Or it may be evolved in this way:-पुर्णो माः = पूर्णमाः, पूर्णमास इयम् पौर्णमासी ॥ The word माः means \"moon\".",

Observe, कन्यादेवताऽस्य, no affix is added to कन्या ॥ In the sentences ऐन्द्रोमन्त्राः and आग्नेयो वै ब्रह्मणोदेवतयेति the affix is added by analogy.\n\nThe whole phrase साऽस्य देवता governs up to _sutra_ (IV. 2. 35). Though the word स was understood in this _sutra_ by _anuvritti_ from _sutra_ (IV. 2. 21), its repetition is for the sake of indicating that the _anuvritti_ of संज्ञा does not extend to it.

In order to apply the affix अण्, we must apply it to those words only, to which the special rules hereinafter taught do not apply. In other words, the affix अण् is added in the sense of collection thereof, to a word which denotes a conscious being, which has _udatta_ accent on the first syllable, which does not end with a _Gotra_-affix, and which is not a word specifically mentioned in the subsequent _sutras_. For, a word expressing a non-conscious being, will take the affix ठक् by (IV. 2. 47), a word having _anudatta_ on the first syllable will have the affix अञ् (IV. 3. 44), a _Gotra_ word will take वुञ् (IV. 2. 39) and especial words like केदार &c take यञ् &c.

It is a _Dvandva_ compound of two words क्षुद्रक and मालव, denoting tribes of _Kshatriyas_. The _Tadraja_ affix अञ् (IV. I. 168) is elided after the first, and ञ्यङ् (IV. 1. 171) after the second word which is a _Vriddham_. When these two words form a compound, the acute falls on the final (VI. I. 223), the initial of this compound is therefore, _anudatta_: and therefore by the last _sutra_ (IV. 2. 44), this word would have taken अञ्; where is the necessity of its being included in this list? It is to exclude the वुञ् of (IV. 2. 39) which comes after a _Gotra_ word. But will not the subsequent अञ् (IV. 2. 44) debar the preceding वुञ् (IV. 2. 39) by the rule of _paratva_? Moreover, a collection or aggregate of two _Gotra_ words will not be called _Gotra_, as an aggregate of countries is not called a 'country' for the application of _janapada_ rule, as काशिकोसलीयाः does not take वुञ् and there will not apply _tadanta_ _vidhi_ to the compound word क्षुद्रकमालव, which ends in a _gotra_ word?. To this we reply, that the fact of the inclusion of this word in the list, is an indication of the existence of these two rules : (1) that वुञ् affix supersedes a subsequent affix in cases of conflict. Thus औपगव and कापटव are _anudattadi_ words because formed by अण् (III. I. 2), and require therefore अञ् by (IV. 2. 44), but वुञ् supersedes it, and we have औपगवकम् and कापटवकम् ॥ The second rule is: (2) that in सामूहिक affixes there is _tadantavidhi_ in spite of the prohibition contained in _vartika_ under (I. 1. 72). As वानहस्तिकं, गौधेनुकम् ॥ The complete sentence in the _Ganapatha_ is क्षुद्रकमालवात् सेनासंज्ञायाम्, the first portion denotes the existence of the above two rules, the second portion सेना &c restricts the application of the rule. The affix is added when it is the name of a सेना 'army' and not otherwise. As क्षौद्रकमालवी सेना, otherwise क्षौद्रकमालवकं ॥ The existence of above corollaries is proved by the _sutra_ of the Grammarian _Apisali_ also धेनुरनञि ठकमुत्पादयति 'the affix ठक् comes after धेनु in denoting collection thereof, when not preceded by the negative particle नञ्', therefore, when preceded by any other word, the affix will apply.\n\n1 खण्डिक (खण्डिका K.), 2 वडवा, 3 क्षुद्रकमालवात्सेनासंज्ञायाम् (a _Vartika_ to 4, 2, 45), 4 भिक्षुक, 5 शुक, 6 उलूक, 7 श्वन्, 8 अहन्, 9 युगवरत्र, (वरत्रा v. 1.; युग, वरत्रा K.), 10 हलबन्ध (बग्धा).",

Sometime it means an estate, as विषयो लब्धः, 'a village has been acquired'. Some time it means an object of perception, as चक्षु र्विषयो रूपं 'color is the object of sight' &c.

The meaning of the words of the aphorism is:- घञः \"after a word ending in the affix घञ्\"; सा 'that', अस्यां 'in it', the feminine gender shows that the word is also feminine. क्रिया \"action\"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. To put it in other words, the _sutra_ means \"After a word ending in घञ्, expressing an action, being in the Ist case in construction, the affix ञ is added in the sense of a 7th case-affix, the resultant word being in the feminine gender\".\n\nThus श्येनपातोऽस्यां वर्तते - श्यैनंपाता, so also तैलंपाता ॥ The nasal is added by (VI. 3. 71). Thus श्यैनंपाता मृगया 'a chase with hawks to bring down or fell the prey'. तैलंपाता स्वधा \"an oblation to the ancestors in which sesamum is thrown\".\n\nThe repetition of सास्यां in this _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ could have been obtained from the last _sutra_, indicates that this is a general rule, and not one confined to \"games\" only. Thus दण्डपातोऽस्यां तिथौवर्तते = दाण्डपाता तिथिः; मौसलपाता तिथिः ॥",
    "42059": "In others words, the _sutra_ means that the affix is added to a word in the accusative case in construction, denoting a person who studies or knows, that. As छन्दोऽधीते = छान्दसः 'who studies Prosody'. वैयाकरणः (VII. 3. 3) 'who knows grammar'. So also नैरुक्तः, नैमित्तः 'who knows the causes'. भौहूर्त्तः, औत्पातः ॥ The word तद् is repeated in this _sutra_, in order to show a distinction between one who studies and who understands.",
    "42060": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus आग्निष्टोमिकः 'who understands or studies _Agnishtoma_ Sacrifice'. वाजपेयिकः, औक्रथिकः, लौकायतिकः, वार्त्तिकसूत्रिकः,सांग्रहसूत्रिकः ॥\n\n_Ishti_:- If a word ending in '_sutra_', begins with the word '_Kalpa_', the affix अण् is added and not ठक्. Thus: काल्पसूत्रः 'who studies _Kalpa_-_sutra_'.\n\nVart:- This affix comes after words ending in विद्या, लक्षण and कल्प, as वायसविद्यिकः, सार्पविद्यिकः, गौलक्षणिकः, आश्वलक्षणिकः, मातृकल्पिकः, पाराशरकल्पिकः ॥\n\nVart:- Not so if the word विद्या is preceded by the words अङ्ग, क्षत्र, धर्म, संसर्ग and त्रि ॥ As अंगविद्यामधीते = आङ्ग विद्यः, क्षात्रविद्यः, धार्मविद्यः, सांसर्गविद्यः, त्रैविद्यः ॥ All these are formed by अण् and not ठक् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ठक् comes in the same sense after names of stories (आख्यान), narratives (आख्यायिका), and after the words इतिहास and पुराण ॥ As यावक्रीतिकः, प्रैयङ्गविकः, वासवदत्तिकः, सौमनोत्तरिकः, ऐतिहासिकः, पौराणिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ल comes in the same sense, after words beginning with सर्व, and स, and after _Dvigu_ compounds. As सर्ववेदः, सर्वतन्त्रः, सवार्तिकः, ससंग्रहः, द्विवेदः पंचव्याकरणः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ठक् comes in the same sense after the words अनसू, लक्ष्य, and लक्षण; As अनसूर्नामग्रन्थ स्तमधीते = आनुसुकः, लाक्षिकः, लाक्षणिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इकन् comes in the same sense after a compound word ending in पद्; as, पूर्वपदिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix षिकन् comes diversely in the same sense, after the compound words शतपथ, and शष्टिपथ. As शतपथिकः f. शतपथिकी (IV. I. 41), षष्टिपथिकः (f. षष्टिपथिकी). By the force of the word 'diversely' we get the affix अण्, as शातपथः and षाष्टिपथः ॥\n\n1 उक्थ, 2 लोकायत, 3 न्याय, 4 न्यास, 5 पुनरुक्त, 6 निरुक्त, 7 निमित्त, 8 द्विपदा, 9 ज्योतिष (द्विपदी, ज्योतिषि) 10 अनुपद, 11 अनुकल्प, 12 यज्ञ, 13 धर्म, 14 चर्चा, 15 क्रमेतर, 16 श्लक्ष्ण, 17 संहिता, 18 पदक्रम (पद । क्रम) 19 संघट्ट संघात also संघट) 20 वृत्ति, 21 परिषद्, 22 संग्रह, 23 गण, 24 गुण (गुणागुण st. गण, गुण), 25 आयुर्वेद. 26 अनुगुण.",
    "42061": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus क्रमकः (VII. 1. 1) &c. The words 1 क्रम, 2 पद, 3 शिक्षा, 4 मीमांसा, 5 सामन् belong to this class.",
    "42062": "This debars अण् ॥ The word अनुब्राह्मण means 'a book in the imitation of or similar to a _Brahmana_ book'. He who studies an अनुब्राह्मण is called अनुब्राह्मणिन्, which word is thus declined:- अनुब्राह्मणी, अनुब्राह्मणिनौ, अनुब्राह्मणिनः &c. The affix इनि also has the force of मतुप्, and by _Sutra_ (V. 2. 115) अत इनि ठनौ, this word अनुब्राह्मण might have taken both the affixes इनि and ठन् in the sense of मतुप्; but as a matter of fact, it only takes इनि in that sense.",
    "42063": "This debars अण् ॥ As, वासन्तिकः 'who studies the book relating to Spring'. वार्षिकः &c ॥ 1 वसन्त, 2 वर्षा, 3 शरद्, 4 हेमन्त, 5 शिशिर, 6 प्रथम, 7 गुण, 8 चरम, 9 अनुगुण, 10 अपर्वन्, 11 अथर्वन् 12 ग्रीष्म,",
    "42064": "This _sutra_ may be rendered in the following way also :- \"There is लुक् of these affixes after a word ending with an affix denoting announcer\". The affixes denoting प्रोक्त or the first propounder are taught in (IV. 3. 101) &c. Thus पाणिनिना प्रोक्तम् = पाणिनीयम् 'the system of Grammar enounced by _Panini_', पाणिनीयमधीते = पाणिनीयः, so also आपिशलः ॥ The difference between the word पाणिनयि meaning the system of Grammar, and पाणिनीय formed with अण्, meaning who studies that Grammar, would consist in the accent, and the formation of the feminine. As पाणिनीया ब्राह्मणी ॥ For had there been no elision expressly enjoined by this _sutra_, in forming the feminine, ङीप् would be required by (IV.1.15), as the word would end in अण्; and the accent of the word would be finally acute (अण् being acute by the universal rule of affix-accent (III. 1. 3)). But when the affix is elided, the feminine is formed by टाप्, the accent is on the middle, owing to the छ affix. (_Phit_ _Su_ II. 19).",
    "42065": "Thus अष्टकं is the title of _Panini_ _sutra_. Those who study अष्टकं and will be called also अष्टकः, as अष्टकाः पाणिनीयाः 'those who study, the _Ashtaka_'. So also दशका वैयाघ्रपदीयाः, त्रिकाः काशकृत्स्नाः ॥\n\nVart:- The elision takes place only where the title is formed by a numeral: as in the examples above given. Thus महावार्तिकं सूत्रमधीते = महावार्तिकः, so also कालापकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"having क् for its penultimate\"? Observe चतुष्टयमधीते = चातुष्टयः ॥ This _sutra_ applies, of course, to those words which are not formed by affixes denoting प्रोक्त or the Announcer.",
    "42066": "The word प्रोक्त is to be read into this _sutra_. The force of the affixes denoting announcer (IV. 3. 101), when used after a word denoting a Vedic Text or a _Brahmana_, is that of expressing \"one who studies\" or \"one who knows\". तद्विषयाणि means \"this relation\", i.e. the subject treated of in this section, namely, the relation of अध्येतृ or वेदितृ ॥ In other words, the affixes, which ordinarily denote 'announcer', have the force of \"one who studies or one who knows\" when added to _Veda_-Text or _Brahmanas_. That is, a प्रोक्त affix should not be added to a _Veda_ or a _Brahmana_, except when an अध्येतृ or वेदितृ affix follows it, and as such latter affixes are always elided by (IV. 2. 94), it follows that a प्रोक्त affix when added to a _Veda_ or a _Brahmana_, means \"he who studies or knows the _Veda_ anounced by\". In fact there is no affix which can denote merely the announcer of a _Veda_, perhaps because the Vedas are eternal and no one can be its announcer only, but must be one who has studied it and known it, in order to qualify him to promulgate it.\n\nThus from the word कठ, the name of a _Veda_-Text, we get कठाः meaning 'those who study or know _Katha_ Veda'. The word is thus formed. To the word कठ we add the affix णिनि denoting announcer, by (IV. 3. 104) : then we elide it by (IV. 3. 107), leaving the bare word कट, then we add अण्, which again we elide by (IV. 2. 64). कठ + णिनि = कट + o (IV. 3. 107); कठ + अण् = कठ (IV. 2. 64) Plural कठाः \"those who study the _Veda_ announced by _Katha_\".\n\nOther examples to illustrate this _sutra_ are: मौदाः (IV. 3. 101) 'who study the _Veda_ announced by _Muda_'. पैप्पलादः, आर्चाभिनः (IV. 3. 104) वाजसनेयिनः (IV. 3. 106) \"who study the _Veda_ announced by _Pippalada_, _Richava_, or _Vajasaneya_\". Similarly with words denoting a _Brahmana_-Text. Thus : ताण्डिनः (IV. 3. 104), भाल्लविनः (IV. 3. 105), शाट्यायनिनः (IV. 3. 105) ऐतरेयिणः (IV. 3. 105) \"who study the _Brahmanas_ announced by _Tandya_, _Bhallava_, _Satyayana_, or _Aitareya_\". \n\nWhy is the word _Brahmana_ which is also _Chhandas_, used separately in this _sutra_? In order to include only a certain limited number of _Brahmana_ Texts to the benefits of this rule, and not all. Thus it will not apply to the _Brahmana_ announced by _Yajnyavalkya_. Thus याज्ञवल्क्येन प्रोक्तानि ब्राह्मणानि = याज्ञवल्क्यानि ॥ Similarly सौलभानि ॥ These _Brahmanas_ being of recent origin, the presumption of eternity does not apply to them, See (IV. 3. 105).\n\nThe word च meaning \"and\" is employed in the _sutra_. It has the force of applying this rule to some other cases not specially mentioned in the _sutra_. Thus it will apply to some _Kalpa_ Texts and _Sutra_ Texts also. Thus काश्यपिनः, कौशिकिनः \"who study or know the _Kalpa_ texts announced by _Kasyapa_ or _Kusika_\" so also _sutra_ : as, \"the पाराशरिणो भिक्षवः \"the _Bhikshus_ who study the _Sutras_ promulgated by _Parasara_\". शैलालिनो नटाः, कर्मन्दिनः, कृशश्विनः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"_Chhandas_ and _Brahmanas_\"? Because the प्रोक्त affix after any other word will have its own significance, pure and simple; as, पाणिनीयं व्याकरणम् ॥ पैङ्गीकल्पः ॥\n\nThe Quadruply-significant affixes.",
    "42067": "The words of this aphorism require a detailed examination. तद् 'that', i.e. the word in construction to which the affix is to be added must be in the nominative case. अस्मिन् \"in this\" -- this gives the meaning of the affix; अस्ति \"is\" this qualifies the sense of the base. इति is added merely for the sake of distinctness, serving the same purpose as quotation marks in modern writing. देशेतन्नाम्नि \"a country having that name\"; this qualifies the sense of the affix. The sense is:- \"the affixes already taught or to be taught, come after a word being in the nominative case in construction, in the sense of the location, when the whole word so formed denotes the name of a country in which that thing exists\".\n\nThis _sutra_ and the three subsequent _sutras_ are in fact one, though divided into four, for purposes of convenience. The affixes having the sense of these four _sutras_, are called चातुरर्थिक \"quadruple significants\".\n\nThus उदुम्बरा अस्मिन् देशे सन्ति = औदुम्बरः _Audumbara_--the country in which there are glomerous fig trees. Similarly बाल्बजः, पार्वतः &c. all these words are formed by the universal affix अण् (IV. 1. 83).\n\nThis _sutra_ debars the अत्वर्थीय affixes.",
    "42068": "The phrase देशे तन्नाम्नि of the last _sutra_ governs this and the two subsequent _sutras_. By these four _sutras_ the names of countries are formed from various substantives. Thus कुशाम्बेन निर्वृत्ता = कौशाम्बी नगरी  \"the city of _Kausambi_, completed by _Kusamba_\". Similarly साहस्री परिखा \"a mote completed by a thousand (gold coins) or persons\". A place is named after the means or the person, by which or through whom it is established.",
    "42069": "The _sutra_ literally means \"his dwelling place\". A place is sometimes named after the people whose habitation it is. Thus शैवः \"the country of the _Sibis_\", ॠजुनावान्निवासौ देशः = आर्जुनावः ॥ The word ॠजुनावां = ॠज्वीनौर्येषां ॥",
    "42070": "In this aphorism the word, to which the affix is to be added, is not shown. The word तस्य must, therefore, be supplied from the last _sutra_. It means, therefore, \"an affix is added to a word in the genetive case in construction, in the sense of not far off\" the whole word being the name of a place. Thus विदिशाया अदूर भवं = वैदिशम् is the city in the neighbourhood of which the river _Vidisa_ flows. So also हैमवतम् ॥\n\nThe च has the force of combining the sense of all the three previous aphorisms with this; so that the four _sutras_ 67, 68, 69 and 70 form but one complete _sutra_, and the meaning denoted by these will be understood in the subsequent aphorisms.",
    "42071": "This of course debars the universal affix अण् (IV. 1. 83). Thus आरडवम् from अरडु 'a tribe of _Kshatriyas_'; काक्षतवम् from कक्षतु, and कार्कटेलवम् from कर्कटेलू ॥ But from इक्षु we have इक्षुमती 'the river _lkshumati_, named after the sugarcanes near it'. Here we add the affix मतुप् taught in the subsequent _sutra_ (IV. 2. 85), which debars अञ् by the rule of a subsequent debarring the prior when both are of equal force (1. 4. 2). The affix अञ् governs the six _sutras_ upto (IV. 2. 77). The difference betweenअञ् and अण् consists in the accent.",
    "42072": "The word बह्वजङ्ग is a compound of बह्वच् meaning literally 'many vowels' i. e. polysyllabic, and of अङ्गः meaning stem. A word which, exclusive of the affix मतुप्, consists of more than two syllables, takes the affix अञ् ॥ This debars अण् ॥ Thus ऐषुकावतम्, सैध्रकावतम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after a polysyllabic stem\"? Observe आहिमतम् यावमतम् ॥ Here though the word अहिमत् ends in the affix मतुप्, yet the अङ्ग or the stem viz. अहि, is a word of two syllables only, hence these words take अण् in forming names of countries. In fact, the word बह्वच् qualifies the word अङ्ग, as it stands without the affix मतुप्, and not the word inclusive of that affix. Therefore मालावतां निवासः = मालावतम् by अण् ॥",
    "42073": "This debars अण्. Thus दीर्घवरत्रेण निर्वृत्तः कूपः = दैर्घवरत्रः \"a well completed by _Dirghavaratra_\". So also कापिलवरत्रः ॥",
    "42074": "This debars अण्; and it applies to all words whether polysyllabic or not. Thus दात्तः \"a well completed by _Datta_\", गौप्तः &c.\n\nWhy do we say on the \"northern bank\"? Because if a well is situate on the southern bank of the river _Vipasa_, then the affix अण् will apply as दात्तः and गौप्तः, the difference being in the accent. This _sutra_ illustrates the refined distinctions drawn by the author, and the importance attached to accents in former times.",
    "42075": "This debars अण् ॥ The word संकलः is equivalent to संगतः कलः ॥ Thus सांकलः, पौष्कलः &c.\n\n1 संकल, 2 पुष्कल, 3 उत्तम, 4 उडुप, 5 उद्वेप (उद्वप), 6 उत्पुट, 7 कुम्भ, 8 निधान (विधान), 9 सुदक्ष, 10 सुदत्त, 11 सुभूत, 12 सुपूत, 13 सुनेत्र, 14 सुमङ्गल, 15 सुपिङ्गल, 16 सूत, 17 सिकत (सिकता), 18 पूतिक (पूतिका; पूतीकी), I9 पूलास, 20 कूलास, 21 पलाश, 22 निवेश, 23 गवेष, 24 गम्भीर, 25 इतर, 26 आन्, 27 अहन्, 28 लोमन्, 29 वेमन्, 30 वरुण (चरण), 31 बहुल, 32 सद्योज, 33 अभिषिक्त, 34 गोभृत्, 35 राजभृत्, 36 भल्ल, 37 मल्ल, 38 माल. also 39 शर्मन्, 40 गृह, 41 भूत.",
    "42076": "The word सौवीर &c, are attributes of देशेतन्नाम्नि (IV. 2. 67): so also the word स्त्रीषु ॥ Thus दात्तामित्री \"the city founded by _Dattamitra_\" (in _Sauvira_). So also वैधूमाग्नी (in _Salva_) काकन्दी, माकन्दी, माणिचरी, जारुषी (in Eastern countries).",
    "42077": "This debars the affix अञ् which would have otherwise come by (IV. 2. 71) and (IV. 2. 73). Thus सुवास्तोरदूरभवं नगरं = सौवास्तवम् ॥ So also वार्णवम् ॥ The use of the word अण्, though its _anuvritti_ came from (IV.1. 83), is for the sake of indicating that this _sutra_ debars _sutra_ (IV. 2. 85). Thus सौवास्तवी नदी ॥\n\n1 सुवास्तु, 2.वर्णु, 3 भण्डु, 4 खण्डु (कण्डु), 5 सेवालिन् (सेचालिन्), 6 कर्पूरिन् 7 शिखण्डिन्, 8 गर्त, 9 कर्कश, 10 शकटीकर्ण (शटीकर्ण), 11 कृष्णकर्ण (कृष्ण), 12 कर्क, 13 ककन्धुमती (कर्कन्धू), 14 गोह (गोह्य and गाहि), 15 अहिसक्थ 16 वृत् ॥",
    "42078": "This debars अञ् of (IV. 2. 74). This _sutra_ consists of one word रोणी in the nominative case. As a general rule all words to which affixes are to be added are put in the ablative case in these _sutras_. The fact of this exceptional treatment of the word रोणी indicates that this word takes अण् under all circumstances, whether alone, or forming part of a compound. In fact, the nominative case in this _sutra_ is a very ingenious explanatory artificiality. Thus रौणः, आजकरौणः or सैहिकरौणः",
    "42079": "This debars अञ् which would have come by (IV. 2. 71) and (IV. 2. 73). Thus कार्णच्छिद्रिकः कूपः ॥ कार्णवाकवम्, त्रैशङ्कवम् ॥",
    "42080": "The above affixes वुञ् &c. are applied to the above classes of words. आदि is to be added to every one of the above seventeen words. The first part of the _sutra_ upto ठक् gives the seventeen affixes, and the latter part gives the seventeen word-class. The allotment or assignment of affixes is made by (I. 3. 10).\n\nThe examples of the above are: (1) आ꣡रीहणकम्, द्रौ꣡घणकम् (2) कार्श्वाश्वी꣡यः, आर꣡ष्टीयः, (3) ऋश्यकः꣡, न्यग्रोधकः꣡, (4) कुमुदिक꣡म्, शर्क्करिक꣡म्, (5) वाशि꣡लम्, काशि꣡लम्, (6), तृणसः꣡, नडसः꣡, (7) प्रेक्षिन्꣡, हलकिन्, (8) अश्मरः꣡, (9) सा꣡खेयम्, सा꣡खिदत्तेयम्, (10) सांकाश्य꣡म्, काम्पिल्य꣡म्, (11) बल्यः꣡, कल्य꣡म्, (12) पाक्षायणः꣡, तौषायणः꣡, (13) का꣡र्णायनिः, वा꣡सिष्ठायनिः, (14) सौत꣡ङ्गमिः, मौ꣡निचित्तिः, (15) प्रा꣡गद्य (16) वाराहक꣡म्, पालाशक꣡म्, and (17) lastly कौमुदिक꣡म् ॥\n\nThe word शिरीष will be seen, by referring to the above lists, to occur in three classes viz अरीहणादि, (36), कुमुदादि (14), and वराहादि (3), Moreover it is governed by the general affix अण् also in the quadruple sense, according to the opinion of _Patanjali_. And because it occurs in the वरणादि class (IV. 2. 82), therefore this universal अण् (IV. 1. 83) will be elided after it.

Dr. Otto Bohtlingk the learned translator of _Panini_ in German, has done so, and I think this addition is necessary for the elucidation of the _sutra_. The aphorism literally means : (The quadruply significant affix) is elided, when the place (देश) to be named is a kingdom (जनपद). Thus पंचालानां निवासो जनपदः = पंचालाः । So also कुरवः, मत्स्याः, अङ्गाः, वङ्गाः, मगधाः, सुह्माः, पुण्ड्राः ॥\n\nWhy is there no _lup_-elision of the affix in the following examples : औदुम्बरो जनपदः 'the Kingdom in which there are fig-trees'. वैदिशो जनपदः &c? Because here the words औदुम्बरः and वैदिशः are not names of Kingdom, but are used merely as epithets. In fact the phrase तन्नाम्नि is understood here also.",

The word शर्करा occurs in the classes कुमुदादि (2) and वराहादि (14) ((IV. 2. 80) classes 4 and 16), and must necessarily take the affixes ठच् and कक् taught therein: for had it not taken those affixes absolutely, their would have been no necessity of inserting this word in those classes. The present rule, therefore teaches by implication, that the word शर्करा takes the general affix अण्, besides the above two especial affixes, denoting locality And when the word takes this universal affix (IV. 1. 83), there the option is, allowed, not otherwise.

The word रंकु belongs to कच्छादि class (IV. 2. 133); and when a human being is to be denoted, then by (IV. 2. 134), it will take the affix अण्, and when a non-human being is to be designated, then it will take अण् by rule (IV. 2. 133); then where is the necessity of the present _sutra_ by which अण् is enjoined when a non-human being is to be designated ? To this the reply is that the force of the negative affix in _amanuysha_ is that of इव; i.e. अमनुष्य = मनुष्य सदृशः \"a being like man, but not man\". The word अमनुष्य does not mean 'anything which is not a man'. For had this been its meaning, then a blanket is also a thing which is not a man, and in denoting a blanket, we should add ष्फक्; but we never do so. When blanket is to be denoted we add अण् of (IV. 2. 133), as राङ्कवः \"a woolen blanket\". When we want to denote a living being other than man, then we add अण् and ष्फक् of this _sutra_.

    "42135": "The word साल्व which occurs in the कच्छादि class, would have taken वुञ् by the last _sutra_, when the sense was that of a man or some human attribute.

    "43001": "The regulating power of the word देशे ceases. The word च indicates that the affix may be छ as well. The word \"optionally\" shows that the general affix अण् may also be employed. Thus there are three affixes, खञ्, च and अण्, and hence there being no equal enumeration, the rule of mutual correspondence (I. 3. 10) does not apply.\n\nThe words युष्मद् and अस्मद् are _Vriddha_, as they belong to _Tyadadi_ class (I. 1. 74), and would have taken छ by (IV, 2. 114); the present _sutra_ enjoins three affixes for each. Thus युष्मद् + अण् = युष्माक + अण् (IV. 3. 2) = यौष्माकः युष्मद् + छ = युष्मद् + ईय = युष्मदीयः (VII. I. 2). युष्मद् + खञ् = युष्माक + ईन (IV. 3. 2.) = यौष्माकीणः (VII. I. 2); and (VIII. 4. 2).

    "43002": "The pronoun तस्मिन् refers to the visible affix खञ्, and not to the understood affix छ which was drawn into the last _sutra_ by the word च ॥\nWhy does the rule of mutual correspondence (I. 3. 10) not apply here, there being two affixes, two words, and two substitutes? This, however, is not done, because the _sutra_ can be divided into two separate aphorisms : as (1) तस्मिन् खञि युष्मदस्मदोर्युष्माकास्माकौ भवतः (ऽ) ततोऽणि च ॥ i.e. (1). when खञ् is added, युष्माक and अस्माक are the substitutes of युष्मद् and अस्मद् respectively (2). So also when अण् follows.\n\nAs for illustrations, see the preceding _Sutra_, e.g. यौष्माकीणः, आस्माकीनः with खञ्, and यौष्माकः and आस्माकः with अण् ॥ This substitution does not take place when छ is added, as युष्मदीयः and अस्मदीयः ॥",

I. 63), there will not be the application of this rule. This difficulty is, however, got over by explaining the word एकवचने as equal to एकार्थे ॥",
    "43004": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus अर्द्ध्यम् 'belonging to half.'\n\nVart:- When it has a prior term the affix ठञ् is used. As बालेयार्द्धिकम्, (बल्यर्थंवस्तु = बालेयं)॥ गौतमार्द्धिकम् ॥",
    "43005": "Thus परार्द्ध्यम्, अवरार्द्ध्यम्, अधमार्द्ध्यम्, उत्तमार्द्ध्यम् ॥\n\nQ. Why do we say पूर्वात् 'preceded by' ? Its use seems to be superfluous. If the _sutra_ stood as परावराधमोत्तमेभ्यः, it would have given the same sense. For the अर्धात् being supplied from the last _sutra_, the whole _sutra_ would have been परावराधमोत्तमेभ्योऽर्धाद् यत् which must mean 'preceded by _para_ &c.'  \n\nA. The words पर and अवर have meanings other than that of दिक् or direction. As परं सुखं 'highest pleasure.' अवरं सुखं 'lowest pleasure.' Therefore, when these words पर and अवर denote direction, then by the subsequent rule, the affix would have been always ठञ् and यत् ॥ The employment of the term पूर्व in the _sutra_, prevents the application of the affix ठञ् even when the words denote direction.\n\nAccording to the _Vartika_ सपूर्वपदाट् ठञ् given under the last _sutra_, the word अर्ध preceded by any word would have taken ठञ्, hence the necessity of this _sutra_ ordaining यत्, when the first terms are पर &c.",

This debars अण् ॥ Thus पूर्वार्ध्यम्, पौर्वार्धिकम्, दक्षिणार्ध्यम् or दाक्षिणार्द्धिकम् ॥\n\nThe word पद is used in the _sutra_ in order to prevent ambiguity. Had the _sutra_ stood merely as दिक्पूर्वाट् ठञ्च, it might have meant (I. 1. 68), '_Ardha_ preceded by the word दिक् takes ठञ् also', for then स्वरूपविधि would have applied, and दिगर्धे जातः would have taken the affix.",
    "43007": "The phrase दिकपूर्वपदात् is to be read into the _sutra_.

So also दाक्षिणार्धाः or दाक्षिणार्धिकाः ॥ The word पौर्वार्द्धाः = ग्रामस्य पूर्वस्मिन्नर्द्धे भवाः and is a _Taddhitartha_ compound.",

    "43009": "The word सांप्रतिक means 'equity, propriety, right, fit'. As नातिदीर्घं नाति हृस्वं मध्यं काष्ठम् \"the proper piece of wood--neither too long nor too short\". मध्ये वैयाकरणः \"the fit Grammarian, neither too refined nor too dull\". मध्यास्त्री \"a proper wife\".",
    "43010": "The word द्वीप occurs in the list of _Kachchhadi_ (IV. 2. 133), and would have taken अण्; and by _sutra_ (IV.  2. 134), it would have taken वुञ् also.

As द्वैप्यं भवन्तोऽनुचरन्ति चक्रम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say अनुसमुद्रं ? Observe द्वैपकम् or द्वैपम् (IV. 2. 133) and (IV. 2. 134). The word '_anu_-_samudra_' is an _Avyayibhava_ compound (II. I. 15).",
    "43011": "This debars अण् ॥ The affix छ which comes after _Vriddha_ words is prohibited by this _sutra_. Thus मासिकः 'monthly' आर्द्धमासिकः 'bi-monthly', सांवत्सरिकः 'annual'.\n\nThe words which denote time even indirectly, also take this affix. As कादम्बपुष्पिकं, व्रैहिपलालिकम् ॥ The word काल governs all the subsequent _sutras_ upto 25. (तत्र जातः).",
    "43012": "This debars अण् (IV. 3. 16). The word श्राद्धे means the 'funeral oblation'; and not श्रद्धावान् पुरुषः 'a faithful or believing person'. Thus शारदिकं श्राद्धं 'the autumnal _Sraddha_'. When not meaning '_Sraddha_', it will be शारदम् ॥",
    "43013": "Thus शारदिको रोगः 'the autumnal disease', शारदिक आतपः 'the autumnal heat or sunshine'.\n\nWhy do we say \"when denoting sickness or heat\"? Observe, शारदं दधि 'the autumnal curd'. This ठञ् debars the ऋतु अण् (IV. 3. 16).",
    "43014": "This makes optional, where by _sutra_ (IV. 3. 11) _ante_, the ठञ् would have been obligatory. Thus नैशम् or नैशिकम् 'nocturnal'. प्रादोषम् or प्रादोषिकम् ॥",

Thus श्वस् + तुट् + ठञ् = शौवस् + त् + इक (VII. 3. 3) = शौवस्तिकः \"belonging to to-morrow or ephemeral\". Otherwise श्वस्त्यः and श्वस्तनः ॥",
    "43016": "The word कालात् is to be read into the _sutra_. All the words must be expressive of time.

With _tyul_, we have पूर्वाह्णेत꣡नं and अपराह्णेत꣡नं ॥  The sign of the locative is not elided by rule (VI. 3. 17).

    "43040": "This debars अण् &c. Thus औपजानुकः, औपकर्णिकः औपनीविकः ।",
    "43041": "Except the word 'adapted' which is the meaning of the word संभूत, all the other words of the _sutra_ have been supplied from the previous aphorisms. The word संभूत does not mean in this _sutra_ 'origin' or 'existence', for the word जात and भव already express that notion. It here means 'suitableness' 'adequacy' i.e. अवक्लृप्तिः and प्रमाणातिरेकः ॥\n\nThus स्रुघ्ने संभवति = सौघ्नः 'what is suited to the country of _Srughna_.' So also माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥ The word तत्र is understood here also.",
    "43042": "This debars अण् ॥ Thus कोशे संभूतं = कौशेयं वस्त्रम् 'silken clothes'.\n\nThe word कोश means 'cocoon.' कौशेयः may literally therefore mean 'anything suited to the cocoon,' and may apply to the caterpillar as well as to the silk made out of cocoon. The word कौशेय is however रूढि and means 'silken.' Nor does it mean 'suited to the sheath,' as a sword, though _kosa_ means 'sheath' also. This _sutra_ would have been more properly placed after (IV. 3. 134), under the heading of विकार rather than of संभूत ॥\n\nIn fact after the _sutra_ एण्या-ढञ् (IV. 3. 159), the addition of कोशाच्च would have been more appropriate.",
    "43043": "Thus हेमन्ते साधुः = हैमन्तः 'what is good or pleasant in autumn' as हैमन्तः प्राकारः शैशिरमनुलेपम् ॥ So also वसन्ते पुष्प्यन्ति = वासन्त्यः 'vernal creepers i. e. which flower in spring', ग्रैष्म्यः पाटलाः ॥ So also शरदि पच्यन्ते = शारदाः शालयः 'the grains that ripen in autumn'. ग्रैष्मा यवाः 'the barley that ripens in summer'.\n\nThis _sutra_ teaches the base and the sense of the affix. It does not directly teach the affix. The above illustrations are examples of the affix अण् &c.",
    "43044": "Thus हेमन्ते उप्यन्ते = हैमन्ता यवाः 'the barley sown in autumn.' ग्रैष्मा व्रीहयः ॥\n\nThe separation of this _sutra_ from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_ in which the _anuvritti_ of उप्त only goes, which could not have been the case had this word been included in the last _sutra_.",
    "43045": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus आश्वयुज्या मुप्ताः = आश्वयुजका माषाः 'the pulse sown in _Asvayuji_.' It is the name of the full-moon in the Asterism of _Asvini_. _Asvayuj_ and_ _Asvini_ are the same. Some texts read अश्वनी instead of अश्विनी ॥",
    "43046": "This debars अण् (IV. 3. 16). Thus ग्रैष्मम् or ग्रैष्मकम् सस्यम् 'the crop sown in summer'. वासन्तम् or वासन्तकम् ॥",
    "43047": "Thus मासे देयमृणं = मासिकं 'a debt due in a month'. आर्द्धमासिकम्, सांवत्सरिकम् ॥ Why do we say ऋणे 'it being a debt'. Observe मासेदेया भिक्षा where no affix is added.",
    "43048": "The words कलापी &c are words which indirectly denote time. Thus the time in which the peacocks mate and make noise is called कलापी ॥ The time in which the _asvatha_ tree fructifies is called अश्वत्थः ॥ The time in which barley is thrashed out is called यवबुस 'barley-chaff'? Thus कलापिनिकाले देयमृणं = कलापकम् 'a debt to be paid when the peacocks make noise (i. e. mating or rainy season) tails.' अश्वत्थकम् and यवबुसकम् ॥",
    "43049": "This debars the अण् and ठञ् ॥ Thus ग्रीष्मेदेयमृणं = ग्रैष्मकम् ॥ So also आवरसमकम् ॥ This affix causes _Vriddhi_, while वुन् would not have done it. Hence the separate affix. The word समा is synonymous with वर्ष 'a year'. The word आवरसमकम् means either आगामिनां संवत्सराणामाद्यवत्सरे देयम् or अतीते वत्सरे देयं यद्यपि न दत्तम् ॥",
    "43050": "Thus संवत्सरे देयमृणं = सांवत्सरिकं, and सांवत्सरकं ॥ आग्रहायणिकं or आग्रहायणकं ॥\n\nThe word संवत्सर occurs in _Sandhiveladi_ Class (IV. 3. 16) and takes अण् when 'fruit' or 'festivity' is meant. The present _sutra_ enjoins ठञ् when 'debt' is indicated.",
    "43051": "Thus निशायां व्याहरति मृगः \"an animal that wanders at night.\" So also प्रादोषः or प्रादोषिकः (IV. 3. 14) 'a brute that yells in the morning.'\n\nWhy do we say मृगः 'a beast' ? Observe निशायां व्याहरति उलूकः ॥ Here there is no affixing. The word व्याहरति also means 'to make noise.' The _Sutra_ may, therefore, also be translated as : \"After a word denoting time, an affix (IV. 1. 83) comes in expressing a wild beast who makes noise at that time\".",
    "43052": "The word कालात् is understood here also. तद् = that : सोढम् = जितम् or अभ्यस्तं \"endured or habituated\". Thus निशा सहचरितमध्ययनं = निशा \"reading by night\". तत् सोढमस्य छात्रस्य = नैशः or नैशिकः 'a student who is habituated or enured to reading by night'. So प्रादोषिकः or प्रादोषः ॥",
    "43053": "The _anuvritti_ of कालात् ceases. The sense of भव here is 'existence', and not that of 'birth' : because the sense of 'birth' is taught in _sutra_ तत्र जातः (IV. 3. 25). Thus, स्रुघ्ने भवः = स्रौघ्नः \"who stays in _Srughna_\". माथुरः, राष्ट्रियः ॥\n\nThe repetition of तत्र in the _sutra_ though its _annuvritti_ could have been drawn from the previous _sutras_, is for the sake of stopping the _annuvritti_ of तदस्य ॥",

They must refer to non-corporeal or abstract objects. As सेनामुख्यं 'who stays in the van of the army'. सेनाजघन्यन् 'who stays in the rear of the army'. In fact, the words '_mukha_' and '_jaghana_' here mean the 'van' and the 'rear' of an army. The word उदक् takes this affix, when the word so formed is a Name.

    "43056": "Thus दार्तेयम् 'what stays in a leathern bag', कौक्षेयम्, कालशेयम्, वास्तेयम्, आस्तेयम् and आहेयम् ॥ आहेयम् is the name of a poison. The word अस्ति is a noun and not a verb here. Its use as a Noun is to be seen in phrases like अस्तिक्षीरा गौः, अस्तिमान् = धनवान् ॥",
    "43057": "This debars यत् (IV. 3. 55) ग्रीवासु भवं = ग्रवेयम् or ग्रैवम् ॥ The word ग्रीवा means blood-vessels, and as they are many, the word is used in the plural in the _sutra_.",

So also '_Tainga_-- a Commentary on Verbal affixes' कार्तः '_Karta_-- a Commentary on _krit_ affixes'. सौप &c. may also mean सुप्सु भवं &c.\n\nWhy do we say व्याख्यातव्यनाम्नः 'after the name of the thing explainable'? The thing to be explained must be a Book, therefore, the affix will not apply to the name of a city &c. For example, if a model be made to describe the city of _Pataliputra_, such a model will not be named after _Pataliputra_ by the addition of affix. Thus सुकोशला is a modal giving a description of _Pataliputra_. This will not be called _Pataliputram_.\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of भव and व्याख्यान runs simultaneosly in all the subsequent _apavada_ _sutras_, and hence we have read the _anuvritti_ of भव into this _sutra_ also.",

The words '_vajapeya_' and '_rajasuya_' are acute in the middle.\n\nThe words क्रतु and यज्ञ mean generally the same thing i.e. 'a sacrifice', but the separate mention of यज्ञ implies that the rule applies to _yajnas_ other than _Soma_-_yajnas_ because the word '_kratu_' is technically applied to _Soma_-, sacrifices only. Thus पाञ्चौदनिकः, दाशौदनिकः ॥\n\nThe _sutra_ is in the plural to prevent the application of the affix to the word-forms '_kratu_' and '_yajna_' (I. 1. 68).",

A book on _Purodasa_ cake is called पुरोडाश; a commentary there on will be पुरोडाशिकः f. पुरोडाशिकी (IV. 1. 41) The ष of the affix indicates that the feminine is formed by ङीष् (IV. 1. 41).

This objection may be answered by saying that the gate is the well-known instrument (करण) to the action of अभिनिष्क्रमण; and an instrument may be used as an agent to a verb: as साध्वसिश्छिनत्ति 'the sword cuts nicely.'\n\nWhy do we say द्वारम् \"when it is a gate\"?

    "43100": "The words of this _sutra_ require a detailed analysis. जनपदिनाम् gen. plural of जनपदिन् meaning 'Iord of an inhabited country' i. e. _Kshatriya_ Princes, बहुवचने 'in the plural', जनपदेन समान शब्दानां 'the same form as the _jana_- _pada_ denoting word', जनपदवत् सर्वम् 'every thing is like _jana_-_pada_'. In other words, 'after those bases denoting _Kshatriya_ Princes which in the plural have the same forms as the names of the countries, the affix in the sense of veneration will be the same as will come after a _janapada word_.' Now the affixes denoting  भक्ति as regards जनपद words are given in _Sutras_ (IV. 2. 124) &c. and those affixes will apply here. Thus अङ्गा जनपदो भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by वुञ् of _Sutra_ (IV. 2. 125), meaning 'who loves the country of _Angas_' Similarly वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः पौन्द्रकः ॥\n\nSimilarly अङ्गाः क्षत्रिया भक्तिरस्य = आङ्गकः formed by the same affix वुञ्, with this difference of meaning 'who loves the _Kshatriyas_ called _Angas_'. So वाङ्गकः, सौह्मकः &c.\n\nWhy do we say 'of _Kshatriya_ Princes'; (_janapadinam_). Observe, पंचाला ब्राह्मणा भक्तिरस्य = पांचालाः ॥ Here the general affix अण् is employed.\n\nThe word सर्व is used in the _sutra_ to show that not only the affixes are the same, but the bases to which the affixes are added will be the same. In the plural, the _Kshatriya_ and the _Janapada_ bases have the same form, but in the singular and dual, the forms of _Kshatriya_-bases are different. Thus मद्रस्यापत्यं = sing. माद्रः (IV. 1. 170) dual, माद्रौ pl. मद्राः. The form मद्राः denotes both 'the Kings or _Kshatriyas_ of _Madras_' as well as 'the country called _Madras_'. Thus मद्रो भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ So also in the singular and dual, मद्राः will be the base to which the affix will be added. Thus माद्रो भक्तिरस्य माद्रौ वा भक्तिरस्य = मद्रकः ॥ Similarly वार्ज्य (from वृजि (IV. 1. 171)), as वार्ज्यो वा भक्तिरस्य वार्ज्यौ वा भक्तिरस्य = वृजिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say जनपदेन समान शब्दानाम् 'the word having the same sound as the _janapada_ word'? Thus अनुषण्डो जनपदः, पौरवो राजा स भक्तिरस्य = पौरवीयः ॥ Here _Paurava_ and _Anushanda_ have not the same sound.\n\nThe word बहुवचने is used in the _sutra_, to indicate, that, though the समान शब्दता or 'the similarity of word-form', occurs in the plural number only, yet this _atidesa_ rule applies to the same words in the singular and dual also. For in the plural, the form will be same, because there the _Tadraja_ affix is elided; but in the singular and dual, the _Tadraja_ affix is not elided, and therefore, the word denoting a principality and the word denoting a prince will not have the same form; but this rule applies there also. As वाङ्गः or वाङ्गौ भक्तिरस्य वाङ्गकः ॥",
    "43101": "The word प्रोक्तं means प्रकर्षेणोक्तं 'preeminently spoken'. It should be distinguished from the word कृत meaning 'done or made'. For the sense of कृतं has been already taught in the _sutra_ कृते ग्रन्थे (IV. 3. 16). Thus अन्येन कृता माथुरेण प्रोक्ता = माथुरी वृत्तिः ॥ पाणिनीयम् 'the system of grammar enounced by _Panini_' आपिशलम्, काशकृत्स्नम् ॥\n\nWorks like _Chhandas_ which were made (कृतं) by nobody, but which were promulgated (प्रोक्तं) from time of time by inspired commentators, may be quoted as examples of the application of this _ sutra_. Or it may apply to the case of a book whose author is another, but whose promulgator or expounder is another. In short, speaking roughly, प्रोक्त is a 'revelation', and कृतः is a 'composition', once a revealer or prophet, the other an author.\n\nAccording to some, this _sutra_ is almost a superfluity. They argue thus: The word प्रोक्त is formed by adding प्र to वच and means 'to lecture' 'he teach', and also the 'means of such teaching &c'. In the first sense of 'lecturing or teaching', the affix is not found. For in every village there are persons who teach or lecture upon _Katha_, _Kalapa_ &c. For example सुशर्मन् may be such a lecturer, but we do not say सुशर्मणा प्रोक्तं काठकं = सौशर्मणम् ॥ Moreover, where we find this affix employed, it is with regard to Books, for which the rule कृते ग्रन्थे is sufficient. If it be said that it should be taught for the _Chhandas_: that is also unnecessary, as the _Vedas_ are not कृत but eternal, the agent only remembers them. If it be said, it refers to the sense of the Vedas, the same objection applies as to the first. But the letter of the _Veda_ is not eternal, it is the sense that is eternal. Therefore the _Rishis_ who revealed, for the first time, at the beginning of a _Kalpa_, the sense of the _Veda_, in appropriate language will be called its promulgators, and the works so revealed will be named after such _Rishis_, as काठकम्, कालापकम् and मौदकम् ॥ This _sutra_, however, is confined to those cases where the author of the book is one person and its promulgator is another : as माथुरी वृत्तिः ॥",

Therefore it will not apply to secular _Slokas_, as तित्तिरिणा प्रोक्तं श्लोकः ॥ The word _Chhandas_ is drawn from _sutra_ (IV. 3. 106.) and from तद्विषयता from (IV. 2. 66).",
    "43103": "This debars छ. The ण of णिनि is for the sake of _Vriddhi_ (useful in the subsequent _sutra_). This is confined, like the last, to the Vedic works.

Observe इदानीन्तनेन गोत्रकाश्यपेन प्रोक्त = काश्यपीयम् \"a work enounced by a modern _Kasyapa_,--one belonging to the _Gotra_ _Kasyapa_: not a _Rishi_'.",

But that is not so, the word _Kalapi_ being separately mentioned in the _sutra_. So also _Katha_ is a pupil of _Vaisampayana_, and _Khadayana_ is a pupil of _Katha_ and had the _sutra_ applied to pupil's pupil also, then the affix णिनि would have applied to खाण्डायन also. But that is not the case, _Khadayana_ being mentioned in _Saunakadi_ class. (IV. 3. 106).\n\nThe word चरकः means वैशम्पायनः, hence चरकाः means pupils of वैशम्पायनः ॥",
    "43105": "This _sutra_ further gives the sense of the affix. पुराण means 'Ancient Sages.' equivalent to पुरातण.

    "43126": "This debas अण् as well छ ॥ Thus _gotra_ :- ग्लौचुकायनकम्, औपगवकम् ॥ According to _Patanjali_, the word चरण which ordinarly means Vedic School, means here duties or doctrines (_dharma_), and traditions (_amnaya_).

    "43127": "The word संघ means 'congregation'. The word लक्षण and अङ्क should be distinguished. लक्षण means a mark which is the property of that person and forms a distinguishing feature of that person, as विद्या 'learning' is a लक्षण of the clan of _Bidas_, the _Bidas_ being famous for learning. The word अङ्क is a mark which shows that the thing so marked is the property of another : as a mark on a cow showing to what person or clan that cow belongs. The अङ्क though occurring in a person or thing does not belong to that person or thing, as the mark of a cow does not belong to the cow, but the लक्षण is a mark which belongs to the person or thing wherein it is found.\n\nThis _sutra_ debars वुञ् of the last aphorism.\n\nVart :- The word घोष 'a cow-pen', should also be read along with संघ &c. Thus the words so formed denote four things (1) congregation, (2) mark (3) sign (4) a hamlet or cowpen. This being so, the rule of mutual correspondence according to order of enumeration (I. 3. 10) does not apply.\n\nThus अञन्तात् (IV. 1. 104) -- बैदः 'a congregation, or mark or sign or a hamlet of the _Bidas_'. यञन्तात् (IV. 1. 105) – गार्ग्य + अण् = गार्गः (VI. 4. 148), (VI. 4. 151) \"a congregation, or a mark, or a sign or a hamlet belonging to the _Gargyas_ ?\" इञन्तात् (IV. 1. 95) – दाक्षि + अण् = दाक्षः (VI. 4. 148) 'a congregation &c of the _Dakshis_'.\n\nThe ण् of अण् could not serve the purpose of _Vriddhi_ here, for all the words to which this affix is added, have _Vriddhi_ by virtue of the affixes अञ्, यञ् or इञ् in which they end. The अ would have served the purpose as well, so far as _Vriddhi_ is concerned, but अण् is used to show that the feminine is formed by ङीप् (IV. 1. 15), Thus बैदी ॥ It further prevents पुंवद्भाव in compounds (VI. 3. 39), as, बैदी विद्याऽस्य = बैदीविद्यः i.e. बिदानामसाधारणी या विद्या सा यस्यास्ति स ॥",

    "43134": "The word विकार means the change of condition of the original. The word तस्य, though its _anuvritti_ could have been supplied from the previous _sutras_, has been repeated here, in order to show that the governing force of शेषे (IV. 2. 92) does not extend further. The affixes taught, therefore, under शेषे ((IV. 2. 92) &c), such as घ, ख &c. have not the sense of तस्य विकार ॥\n\nNo affix has been taught here in this _sutra_: the general affix अण् (IV. 1. 83) therefore will come in this sense, as well as the affixes to be taught hereafter. To give an example under this _sutra_, we must take such a word which is not governed or provided for, by the subsequent _sutras_. That is the word must not denote a living animal for to it अञ् (IV. 3. 154) applies; it must have _udatta_ on the first syllable, for an _anudattadi_ will have अञ् (IV. 3. 140); it must not have a _Vriddhi_ vowel आ, ऐ, or औ in the first syllable, to which मयट् (IV. 3. 144) applies; and it must not be a word specifically mentioned in any one of the following aphorisms. Thus it applies to the words अश्मन् and भस्मन् formed by मनिन् (_Un_IV. 146,145) and to मृतिका formed by तिकन् (V. 4. 39) which are _adyudatta_ owing to नित् accent.

So also ओषधिः as, मौर्वम् 'product of _Murva_ i.e. ashes or the stalk of _Murva_'. So also वृक्ष, as, कारीरं meaning \"the stalk or the ashes of _Karira_ tree\".\n\nIn the subsequent _sutras_, both the words विकार and अवयव have governing force.

Certainly not of the primitive, for लुक् is never applied to the elision of a base, but of an affix only (I. 1. 61). It follows therefore that the elision is of the affixes of कंसीय and परशव्य ॥ Now these words have two affixes, thus. To the root कम् is added first the _Unadi_ affix स (_Un_ III. 62) and we get कंस; next to कंस is added छ. So also to पर + शृ is added the affix उ (_Un_ I. 33) and we have परशु, to which is then added यत् and we have परशव्य ॥ The question arises, should these affixes स and उ be also elided. The answer is 'no'. The word प्रातिपदिकात् of (IV. 1. 1) is understood is this _sutra_; so the elision will take place of those affixes only which follow a _pratipadika_. But स and उ are added to a _Dhatu_ and not a _pratipadika_, hence those affixes are saved from the operation of लुक् ॥\n\nThe word परशव्य being gravely accented on the first (VI. 1. 185) would have taken अञ् by (IV. 3. 140).

Thus देवदत्तेन जितम् will not give rise to any affix, for the word दैवदक्तिकः is not found in usage having this sense. So also अंगुल्या खनति gives rise to no affix. Though the verbs '_divyati_' &c, are in the 3rd Person Present Tense, Singular number, the derivative is not limited by these conditions. Thus आक्षिकौ and आक्षिकाः what are also valid, and so also अक्षैरदीव्यत् will give also आक्षिकः; so also आक्षिकस्त्वम् आक्षकोहम् ॥ Though in a sentence the verb is generally the principal word (क्रियाप्रधान), here owing to the _Taddhita_ affix, the instrument is taken as the principal.",
    "44003": "The word संस्कृतम् means 'refining or enhancing the quality of a thing'. Thus दध्ना संस्कृतं = दाधिकम् 'refined or made tasteful by curd'.

So also after dissyllabic words: as, घटिकः, प्लविकः, बाहुकः ॥\n\nThe ष in ष्ठन् in the _sutra_ is not part of the affix, but comes through _sandhi_ rules. The feminine of बाहुकः being बाहुका ॥ In fact the indicatory ष् occurs in these _sutras_ only (IV. 4. 9), (IV. 4. 10), (IV.  4. 18), (IV. 4. 53) and (IV. 4. 74), in this book.",
    "44008": "The word चरति means both to go on and to eat. Thus दध्ना चरति = दाधिकः 'who gets on, with being fed on curd, हास्तिकः 'who travels by an elephant'.",
    "44009": "This debars ठक् ॥ The ल् is for accent (VI. I. 193). The ष of ष्ठल् here is a part of the affix, contrary to what it was in _sutra_ 7 _ante_. To remove the doubt where ष is the part of an affix, and where it is not, the following mnemonic verse has been composed : \"आकार्षत् पर्पादेभस्त्रादिभ्यः कुसीदसूत्राच्च, आवसथात् किक्षरादेः षितः षडेते ठगधिकारे ॥ In the six _Sutras_ 9, 10, 16, 31, 74, and 53, the affixes have indicatory '_sh_' Here ष being इत्, the feminine is formed by ङीष् (IV. 1. 41).

The proper form, therefore, would have been शौवगणिकः ॥ The irregularity is, however, explained by saying that the prohibition contained in (VII. 3. 8) which applies when श्वन् is followed by इञ्, applies also to श्वन् followed by ठञ् ॥ In fact, the rule (VII. 3. 4) does not apply, whenever the word श्वन् is followed by an affix beginning with the letter इ ॥",
    "44012": "Thus वेतनेन जीवति = वैतनिकः 'who lives upon wages - a menial servant'.

So भ꣡रटिकः f. भरटिकी꣡ ॥ The word भस्त्र means a leathern bellows by which the iron is heated, or a leathern bag in which grain &c, is carried. \n\n1 भस्त्रा, 2 भरट, 3 भरण (भारण), 4 शीर्षभार, 5 शीर्षेभार, 6 असंभार, 7 अंसेभार ॥",
    "44017": "In the altemative, the general affix ठक् will apply. Thus विवधेन हरति = वि꣡वधिकः f. विवधिकी॑; so also वी꣡वधिकः f. वीवधिकी꣡ ॥ When the affix is ठक्, we have वैवधिकः in both cases, the feminine being वैवधिकी꣡ ॥\n\nThe word विवध and वीवध are synomyms both meaning 'a piece of wood carried on the shoulders to carry loads, on the road.' विवधिकः meaning 'a carrier of loads, a pedler'. The real _sutra_ is विभाषा विवधात्, the _Kasika_ has added वीवध from a _Vartika_.",

    "44020": "The त्रि here refers to the affix '_ktri_' (III. 3. 88). Thus the root डुपच् takes त्रि and forms पक्त्रि, which is not a complete word, but must take the augment मप्, to form a full word. Thus पच् + क्त्रि + मप् = पक्त्रिमम् 'what is completed by being cooked'. So from डुवप् we have वप् + क्त्रि + मप् = उप्त्रिमम् (VI. I. I5): from डुकृञ् we have कृत्रिमम् ॥\n\nThe word नित्य in the _sutra_ indicates that the affix क्त्रि never comes singly by itself, all words ending in '_Ktri_' are invariably followed by मप् also. In fact मप् way be regarded as an invariable augment of the affix '_Ktri_'.\n\nVart:- After a word ending in an affix denoting 'condition', the affix इमप् is added. Thus पाकेन निर्वृत्तं = पाकिमम् (पच् + घञ् (III. 3. 18) + इमप्), so त्यागिमम्, सेकिमम्, कुट्टिमम् ॥",
    "44021": "Thus आपमित्यकम् 'debt', and याचितकम् 'a thing begged for use'. The word अपमित्य is formed from the root मा with the prefix अप, and the suffix क्त्वा (III. 4. 19). The क्त्वा is changed to ल्यप्, and इ substituted for आ (VI. 4. 70). The word is an Indeclinable, and therefore the _anuvritti_ of  तेन does not run here.",
    "44022": "The word तेन is understood here. The word संसृष्ट means unification, mixing &c. Thus दध्ना संसृष्ट = दाधिकम् 'smeared with curds' मारिचिकम्, शार्ङ्गवेरिकम् पैप्पलिकम् ॥ The word '_sanskrtam_' (IV. 4. 3) and '_sansrshtam_' should be distinguished.

    "44028": "The word तद् shows that the words must be in the second case in construction. The verb वर्तते is intransitive, how can it take an object, and how can it be in construction with an objective case? The words in the accusative after the verb वर्तते are not its objects, but are used as adverbs qualifying the sense of the verb, and adverbs are always put in the accusative case. Thus प्रतीपं वर्तते = प्रातीपिकः (प्रतिगता आपोऽस्मिन्, the आ changed to ई (V. 4. 74) and (VI. 3. 97) retrograde i. e. 'which is unfavourable.' So आन्वीपिकः 'favorable.' प्रतिलोमिकः 'inverse' आनुलोमिकः 'direct.' पातिकूलिकः, आनुकूलिकः The two words प्रातीपिक and आन्वीपिक mean 'unfavourable' and 'favourable' respectively.",
    "44029": "Thus परिमुखं वर्तते = पारिमुखिकः 'being before the face,' 'being near or present'.\n\nThe word च in the _sutra_ implies that the affix applies to other words also not mentioned. As पारिपार्श्विकः ॥ The word परिमुख is an _Avyayibhava_ compound (II. I. 12). If परि has the force of exclusion (I. 4. 88), then पारिमुखिकः will mean 'a servant who always avoids the face of his master' \"स्वामिनो मुखं वर्जयित्वा सेवको वर्त्तते,\" and if परि means 'all round,' then the word will mean \"a servant who is always in the presence of his master -- यतः स्वामिनो मुखं ततस्ततो वर्त्तते\"॥",

Similarly त्रैगुणिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The word वृद्धि is changed to वृधुषि before this affix. As, वृद्धिं प्रयच्छति = वार्धुषिकः 'a usurer' 'who gives for the sake of increase' Or the word वृधुषि may be taken as a separate word synonymous with वृद्धि ॥\n\nWhy do we say गर्ह्यम् 'with a mean motive'? Observe द्विगुणं प्रयच्छति अधर्मणः 'the debtor gives double'.",
    "44031": "The word कुसीद means 'interest'. The lending of ten (दश) on a condition that the borrower will pay eleven (एकादश) after a month is called दशैकादश ॥ This _sutra_ debars ठक् ॥ The difference between the two affixes ष्ठन् and ष्ठच् is in the accent (VI. 1. 197) and (VI. 1. 163) Thus कुसीद + ष्ठन् = कु꣡सीदकः fem. कुसीदकी꣡ (VI. 1. 41). So दशैकादशिकः꣡ fem की꣡ ॥",
    "44032": "Thus बदराण्युञ्छति = बादरिकः 'who picks up jujubes'. श्यामाकिकः, काणिकः ॥ To pick up every grain (कण) fallen on the ground is called उञ्छ ॥",

    "44035": "Thus पक्षिणो हन्ति = पाक्षिकः 'a bird-killer'. The affix applies not only to the word-forms पक्षि &c, but to words denoting birds &c. (See (I. I. 68)). Therefore, we have forms शाकुनिकः, मायूरिकः, तैत्तिरिकः ॥ So also with मत्स्य, as, मात्स्यिकः, मैनिकः, शाफरिकः, शाकुलिकः ॥ So also with मृगः, as मार्गिकः, हारिणिकः, सौकरिकः, सारङ्गिकः ॥",

The च in the _sutra_ indicates that the sense of हन्ति 'who kills' of the last, is to be connected with this _sutra_ by the conjunction 'and'. Thus परिपन्थं हन्ति = पारिपन्थिकः ॥\n\nThe phrase 'being in the second case in construction' is understood in this _sutra_, why has then the word परिपन्थम् been shown in the second case in the _sutra_, for it is a mere superfluity? No, it shows the secular form of the word. The word परिपन्थ is synonymous with परिपन्थ, the latter, however, having other senses also.",
    "44037": "Thus दण्डमाथं धावति = दाण्डमाथिकः 'who runs on a high way'. So also शौल्कमाथिकः ॥ Similarly पादविकः, आनुपदिकः ॥ The word माथ means 'a way'.",
    "44038": "The word आक्रन्द means 'a place where persons weep' e.g. a battle - field. It also means 'weeping' 'invoking' &c. The difference between ठक् and ठञ् in the accent. Thus आक्रन्दं धावति = आक्रन्दिकः꣡ or आ꣡क्रन्दिकः, f. आक्रन्दिकी 'a person who runs to a place where cries of distress are heard'.",
    "44039": "Thus पूर्वपदं गृह्णाति = पौर्वपदिकः, so also औत्तरपदिकः ॥ The word उत्तरपद is used in order to prevent the application of the rule when पद is preceded by the affix बहु ॥",
    "44040": "Thus प्रतिकण्ठं गृह्णाति = प्रातिकण्ठिकः ॥ So also आर्थिकः, लालामिकः ॥ The word प्रतिकण्ठ here is an _Avyayi_-_bhava_ meaning कण्ठं कण्ठं प्रति, and not प्रतिगतः कण्ठं = प्रतिकण्ठ, for to the latter no affix is added.",
    "44041": "Thus धर्मम् चरति = धार्मिकः \"religious\". So also आधर्मिकः \"irreligious undutiful\", by a _Vartika_.",
    "44042": "Thus प्रतिपथमेति = प्र꣡तिपथिकः or प्रातिपथिकः꣡ \"who goes along the road\" the ठक् causes _Vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 118) whilst ठन् does not.",

The word समवायान् is in the plural number in the _sutra_, indicating that the _svarupa_-_vidhi_ (1. 1. 69) does not apply; the affix being applied not only to the word-form समवाय but to its synonyms also. समवैति means coming together. Thus समवायान् समवैति = सामवायिकः 'who assembles in an assembly'. So also सामाजिकः, सामूहिकः, सान्निवेशिकः ॥",

'who alway looks at the fore-head of his master from a distance, keeps himself aloof, does not come near to perform any work.' So also कौक्कुटिकः 'a religious mendicant, a _Bhikshu_.' The space of ground over which a hen can fly without falling, is to be understood here by the word कुक्कुटी ॥ In other words, a small space of ground, for hens cannot sustain their flight for a long distance. Therefore, owing to the smallness of space, the mendicant walks looking down over the ground, and hence he is called कौक्कुटिकः ॥ The word also means 'a hypocrite with down-cast eyes.'",

Thus परलोकोऽस्ति इति यस्य मतिरस्ति स आस्तिकः, an _Astika_ is he who believes that the Hereafter is. Contrary to him is a नास्तिकः who does not believe in a Hereafter.

The best way however, to remove this objection is to read _sutras_ (IV. 4. 65), and (IV. 4. 66) in this wise: (IV. 4. 65) हितं भक्षाः तदस्मै and दीयते नियुक्तं ॥ Thus अपूपंभक्षणं हितमस्मै = आपूपिकः 'He for whom cake is good food' i. e. who eats cakes with benefit, or who is fond of cakes. So also शाष्कुलिकः, मौदकिकः ॥ In analysing these _taddhitas_, such as आपूपिकः &c, the word हितं or its synonym, and a verb denoting eating should be employed.",
    "44066": "The word दीयते नियुक्तम् means नियोगेन i.e. अव्यभिचारेण दीयते 'to be given by appointment or rightfully'. Thus अग्रे भोजनमस्मै नियुक्तं दीयते = आग्रभोजनिकः 'a _Brahmana_ always entitled to occupy the foremost seat at dinner'. So also आपूपिकः 'entitled to get cakes', शाष्कुलिकः ॥ Some say that the word नियुक्तं means नित्यं 'always'. According to them आपूपिकः would mean अपूपा नित्यमस्मै दीयन्ते 'to whom always cakes are given'.",
    "44067": "This टिठन् debars ठक् ॥ The इ of टि is for the sake of pronunciation, the ट् indicates that the feminine is formed by ङीप् (IV. 1. 154). Thus श्राणा नियुक्तमस्मै दीयते = श्राणिकः f. श्राणिकी 'who is entitled to get rice gruel'. So also मांसौदनिकः f. मांसौदनिकी ॥\n\nThe difference between ठक् and टिठन् is in accent, the former having _udatta_ on the final (VI. 1. 165), the latter on the initial (VI. 1. 197). The feminine of ठक् and टिठन् will both be formed by ङीप् (IV. 1. 15). Now the affix ठञ् resembles टिठन् both in accent (VI. 1. 197) and in feminine (IV. 1. 15). Why was not ठञ् used instead of टिठन्, for it would have produced exactly the same forms ? True, as regards the words श्राणा and मांसौदन the affix ठञ् might have been employed instead of टिठन् ॥ According to some, however, the affix टिठन् applies to मांस and ओदन separately also. But ठञ् cannot be applied to ओदन as it would cause _Vriddhi_ (VII. 2. 117) which टिठन् does not. Thus ओदन् + टिठन् = ओदनिकः, f. ओदनिकी ॥ With ठञ् the form would have been औदनिकः which is not wanted.\n\nThe word श्राणा is a Past Participle (क्त) of श्राणा 'to cook.' The श्रा is not changed to श्रृ as required by (VI. 1. 27). This is an anomaly. The _nistha_ त is changed to ण (VIII. 2. 43). The form श्राता is also found, as in (VI. I. 36), and the regular form is शृतं = क्षीरम् (VI. 1. 27).",
    "44068": "This debars ठक् which comes in the alternative. Thus भक्तमस्मै दीयते नियुक्तं = भाक्तः ॥ In the alternative भाक्तिकः 'a regularly fed'. i. e. a retainer.",
    "44069": "Thus शुल्कशालायां नियुक्तः = शौल्कशालिकः 'a superintendent of custom-house.' So also आकरिकः, आपणिकः, गौलूमिकः, दौवारिकः ॥ The word तत्रनियुक्त is a _Tatpurusha_ compound formed by (II. 1. 46). The word _niyukta_ here has a different meaning from that in (IV. 1. 60), hence its repetition here.",
    "44070": "This debars ठक् । The difference is in accent and want of _Vriddhi_. Thus देवागारे नियुक्तः = देवगारिकः, कोष्ठागारिकः, भाण्डागारिकः ॥",
    "44071": "The word अदेशकाल means the time or place of study, which is prohibited by sacred institutes. अध्यायिन् means one who studies. Thus श्मशानेऽधीते = श्माशानिकः 'who reads in a funeral ground.' चतुष्पथिकः 'who studies where four roads meet.' So also चतुर्दश्यामधीते = चातुर्दशिकः, 'who reads on the 14th lunar day.' So also आमावास्यिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'improper time and place ?' Observe स्रुघ्नेऽधीते, पूर्वाह्णेऽधीते ॥",
    "44072": "Thus वंशकठिने व्यवहरति = वांशकठिनिकः 'whose occupation is in a bamboo thicket' or 'who does what is proper to be done in such a place' i.e. तस्मिन्देशे या क्रिया यथानुष्ठेया तां तथैवानुतिष्ठेति ॥ So also वार्ध्रकठिनिकः ॥ So also प्रास्तारिकः, सांस्थानिकः ॥",
    "44073": "This rule applies in forming epithets, denoting such persons, who are allowed under the Sacred Institutes, to dwell near human habitations. Thus आरण्यकाः are those ascetics who are ordained to dwell in forests, at least two miles away from human habitations. नैकटिकाः are those ascetics who are allowed by the rule of their Order to live near human habitations. Thus निकटे वसति = नैकटिकः 'an ascetic.'",
    "44074": "The ल् of ष्ठल् is for accent (VI. I. 193), the ष् is for ङीष् (IV. 1. 41). Thus आवसथे वसति = आवसथिकः 'who dwells in a house' i. e. a domestic person as opposed to an ascetic. The feminine will be आवसथिकी ॥ So far was the scope of ठक् as ordained in (IV. 4. 1). Henceforward other affixes will be ordained.",
    "44075": "Thus in the next _sutra_ तद्वहति रथयुगप्रासङ्गम् we must read the affix यत् ॥ रथ्यः, युग्यः, प्रासङ्ग्यः ॥",
    "44076": "Thus रथं वहति = र꣡थ्यः 'what bears a car' a carriage-horse. Similarly यु꣡ग्यः 'a yoke-bearing ox', प्रासंग्यः 'being trained in a break'. प्रासङ्ग is a piece of wood placed on the neck of colts, at the time of breaking. This rule applies to compounds ending with _ratha_, as, परमरथ्य ॥ See (IV. 3. 121), (IV. 3. 123) also. That which carries will be called 'carrier' or वोढृ therefore रथस्य वोढृ will get the affix यत् by (IV. 2. 120), read with (IV. 3. 121). Its special mention here indicates that the affix will come, even after _Dvigu_ compounds and will not be elided by (IV. I. 88). Thus द्वौ रथौ वहति = द्विरथ्यः ॥ The _tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies to this word as we have shown under (IV. 3. 121). The word युग्य has been already formed by the _krit_ affix (III. 1. 121), that युग्य differs from the present, in accent when the word takes the negative particle, for that was by ल्यप् and this is by यत्, and therefore by (VI. 2. 156), अयुग्य꣡म् will be finally acute when formed by यत् ॥ The word युगं must mean 'the portion of a car' for the application of this rule, and not a cycle of time &c. Therefore not here युगं वहति राजा कलिं द्वापरं वा ॥",
    "44077": "Thus धुरं वहति = धुर्यः (formed by यत्) the lengthening ordained by (VIII. 2. 77) is prevented by (VII. 2. 79) because धुर is _Bha_-stem, or धौरेयः (formed by डक् (VII. 1. 2)) 'a beast of burden'. This _sutra_ might have stood as धुरो ढक् च, for यत् would have been read into it from (IV. 4. 75).",
    "44078": "Thus सर्वधुरां वहति = सर्वधुरीणः (VII. 1. 2). The affix ख applies to other compounds also ending in धुर, e.g. उत्तरधुरीणः, दक्षिनधुरीणः ॥ The word सर्वधुर is a compound of सर्वा + धुर् (II. 1. 49), the _samasanta_ अ being added by (V. 4. 74). The word धूः being feminine, the whole compound would be feminine by (II. 4. 26). The word सर्वधुरात् in the _sutra_ should not be taken, therefore, as regulating the gender, for though it is in the masculine gender, the affix comes after the feminine word. In fact सर्वधुर in the _sutra_ should be taken as a nominal-stem or _pratipadika_ equal to सवधुरा ॥",
    "44079": "The elision is optional. Thus एकधुरां वहति = एकधुरीणः or एकधुरः ॥ The compounding is _taddhitartha_ (एकां धुरं वहति) to which is added the _samasanta_ अ, and then the affix ख ॥",
    "44080": "Thus शकटं वहति = शाकटः 'an ox' i. e. what bears a car. This could be evolved by तस्येदम् अण् as शाकटस्य वोढ = शाकटः ॥ The specification indicates that _tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies here, as द्वे शकटे वहति = द्वैशकटः, and the affix is not elided (IV. 1. 88).",
    "44081": "Thus हलं वहति = हालिकः a ploughman सैरिकः 'a plough ox.' The ठक् would have come by (IV. 3. 124), the specification shows _tadantavidhi_ and non-elision, as द्वैहालिकः, त्रैसीरिकः ॥",
    "44082": "Thus जनीं वहति = जन्यः 'a friend of a bridegroom,' fem. जन्याः 'a bridesmaid.' The word जनी means 'bride.' जन्या lit. means 'what bears the bride' i. e. who carries the coy bride to the bride-groom at the time of play &c.",
    "44083": "Thus पादौ विध्यन्ति = पद्याः (VI. 3. 53) शर्कराः, 'what pierce the feet' i.e. pebbles. ऊरव्याः कण्टकाः 'thorns' i. e. what pierce the thigh.\n\nWhy do we say \"provided it is not a bow, अधनुषा\"? Observe पादौ विध्यति धनुषा, no affix is added here. This exclusion of धनुष् indicates that the act of piercing must be such as not to be done by a bow &c. Therefore the affix does not apply to cases like these चौरं विध्यति, शत्रुंविध्यति ॥",
    "44084": "Thus धनं लब्धा = धन्यः, so also गण्यः ॥ लब्धृ is formed from लभ् by तृन्, hence it takes the accusative.",
    "44085": "Thus अन्नं लब्धा = आन्नः 'fed' 'who has obtained food.'",
    "44086": "Thus वशंगतः = व꣡श्यः 'come under control' i. e. subdued i. e. a dependant or servant. वशः = काम इच्छा तां प्राप्तः i. e. परेच्छानुगामी ॥",
    "44087": "Thus पद दृश्यमस्मिन् = पद्यः कर्दम 'mud' lit. soft mud in which foot-mark can be seen at every step. It describes mud which is neither very hard nor very fluid, but having sufficient consistency to take the impression of the foot. So पद्याः पांसवः 'dust' for in it also the impression of the foot can be seen. It also means 'the foot-path.' The word दृश्यम् means शक्यते द्रष्टुम् this being the force of the _kritya_ affix 'ya' in दृश ॥",
    "44088": "The word आबर्हि from वृहू 'to up root,' means 'uprooting,' = उत्पाटनं ॥ मूलमेषामाबर्हि = मू꣡ल्याः 'a kind of pulse' e. g. माषा । मुद्गाः ॥ These cereals cannot be harvested without uprooting the whole plant. According to _Padamanjari_ the word should be आवर्हि and not आबर्हि, with a व and not ब ॥",
    "44089": "This word is formed by adding षुक् and य to धेनु ॥ It has _udatta_ on the final. धेनुष्या means that cow (धेनु) which is given to a creditor in discharge of a debt or as a pledge to satisfy the debt from her milk. It is also called पीतदुग्धा ॥ As धेनुष्यां भवते ददामि ॥",
    "44090": "Thus गृहपतिना संयुक्तः = गार्हपत्यः 'the _Garhapatya_ Fire': i. e. a Fire particularly consecrated by the Householder. The word संज्ञायां of the last _sutra_ should be read into it, thus गार्हपत्यः means a particular Fire, and not every thing relating to a गृहपति ॥ The Fire in which husband (_grihapati_), together with or joined with his wife, performs sacrifice is called _Garhapatya_. That sacrifice cannot be performed in Dakshinagni. Or that fire in which _Grihapati_ hymns are recited is called _Garhapatya_.",
    "44091": "The words in the above must be all in the Instrumental case in construction, for the sense of the affix shows that it should be so. Thus.\n\n1. नावा तार्यम् = नाव्यम् 'water' 'a river', lit what can be crossed by a boat.\n\n2. वयसा तुल्यः = वयस्यः 'a friend', lit. one alike in age.\n\n3. धर्मेण प्राप्यम् = धर्म्यम् 'what is attainable through _dharma_. Could not this form have been evolved by the next _sutra_ धर्मादनपेते (IV. 4. 92) ? No, धर्म्यम् formed by that aphorism means 'what is consistent with _dharma_' 'what is just'. The present धर्म्य refers to the 'fruit', the other to the 'act'.\n\n4. विषेण वध्यः = विष्यः 'who deserves to be put to death by poison'.\n\n5. मूलेनानाम्यम् = मूल्यम् \"price\" lit. or to be overpowered or bent by the root\". The word आनाम्य (which is formed from the root नम् 'to bow' by the affix ण्यत् contrary to rule (III. 1. 98) which reguired यत्), means अभिभवनीयम् 'what ought to be overpowered': hence मूल्यम् means 'the price, worth, cost', because articles like 'cloth' &c are produced by the out-lay of stock or capital (मूल); 'price' being a thing which, because it is capital plus profit, is superior to capital, and thus by price or _mulyam_, the capital or _mula_ is overpowered.\n\n6. मूलेन समः = मूल्यः 'purchasable' lit, equivalent to capital' e.g. cloth पटः i. e. equivalent acquisition resulting from the employment of capital.\n\n7. सीतया समितं = सीत्यं 'a field'. lit. 'measured out by furrows' according to Dr Ballantyne. The word समितं is equivalent to संगतं 'united with according to _Kasika_. सीत्यं therefore literally means 'a ploughed field' i. e. 'what is united with furrows'. The affix will apply also to words ending with सीता, e.g. परमसीत्यं, उत्तमसीत्यं, द्विसीत्यं ॥\n\n8. तुलया सम्मितं = तुल्यम् \"equal\" lit. 'meted by the balance'. सम्मित means समानं, सदृशं ॥\n\nNote:- The fruits of good deeds, like happiness &c, which are attainable or _prapya_ through '_dharma_', may be said also _dharmad_ _anapetam_ because an effect must have a cause. Hence arises the doubt as to what is the difference between this and the next _sutra_. The '_anapetam_' in the next _sutra_ means tho fulfilling or following the Law established by the _Shishthas_, and has no reference to its fruits. Because the effect of _dharma_ in to destroy _dharma_-- i.e. the fruits in the shape of happiness &c lessen, and ultimately extinguish the _dharma_. Therefore, the fruit of _dharma_, which is to be taken in this _sutra_, as referred to by the word _prapya_, ia diametrically opposed to the practising of _dharma_, referred to by the word _anapeta_ of the next _sutra_.",
    "44092": "The ablative construction is inferred from its employment in the _sutra_ itself. Thus धर्मादनपेतं = ध꣡र्म्यम् 'just' 'not deviating from merit.' Similarly प꣡थ्यम् ॥ शास्त्रीयात् पथो यदनपेतं तत् पथ्यं, न तु तस्मादनपेतश्चोरः 'wholesome diet,' अ꣡र्थ्यम् 'fit', ना꣡य्यम् 'just, suitable.' The word संज्ञायां (IV. 4. 89) governs this _sutra_ also, and hence the derivatives must have the above meanings.",
    "44093": "Thus छन्दसा निर्मितं = छन्दस्यः 'made at will.' The word छन्दस् is here synonymous with इच्छा 'will, wish, desire, fancy' &c, and does not mean 'metre or _Veda_.'",
    "44094": "The यत् is drawn into the _sutra_ by the particle च ॥ उरसा निर्मितः = औरसं꣡ 'own son not adopted, lit. produced through the loins,' With यत् the form will be उरस्यः॑ ॥ These words denote son, and not anything produced from the loin, because the word संज्ञायां (IV. 4. 89) governs this _sutra_ also.",
    "44095": "The construction is shown by the aphorism itself. Thus हृदयस्य प्रियः = हृ꣡द्यः 'pleasant to the heart' e. g. हृद्यो देशः, हृद्यं वनम् ॥ But we cannot say हृद्यः पुत्रः, the word संज्ञायां (IV. 4. 99) governs this _sutra_ also, and thus restricts the meaning of the word.",
    "44096": "The word हृदयस्य is understood in the _sutra_. The word बन्धन gives the sense of the affix and is qualified by the word ऋषि ॥ That by which a thing is bound is called बन्धनं ॥ The word ऋषि means here the _Veda_ or the Vedic bymn. Thus हृदयस्य बन्धनमृषि = हृ꣡द्यः 'the _Mantra_ by which the heart of another can be brought under one's control', i.e. a वशीकरण मन्त्रः ॥",
    "44097": "Thus मतस्य करणं = म꣡त्यः 'the means of acquiring knowledge'. जनस्य जल्पः = ज꣡न्यः 'a rumour'. हलस्य कर्षः = ह꣡ल्यः 'ploughed'. So also द्विहल्यः, त्रिहल्यः, the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ applies रथसीताहलेभ्यो यद्विधौ ॥",
    "44098": "Thus सामसु साधुः = सामन्यः॑ (VI. 4. 168) 'conversant with the _Sama_-_Veda_'. So also वेमन्यः, कर्मण्यः, शरन्यः &c. The word साधु here means प्रवीण, or योग्य 'expert' and 'fit', and does not mean उपकारक 'a benefactor or a good person'. When the sense is that of 'good', the _sutra_ तस्मै हितम् (V. I. 5) will apply.",
    "44099": "This debars यत् ॥ Thus प्रतिजने साधुः = प्रातिजनीनः (VII. I. 2) 'suitable against an adversary', or 'who is excellent for every person'. So also एवं युगीनः, सांयुगीनः ॥\n\n1 प्रतिजन, 2 इदंयुग, 3 संयुग, 4 समयुग, 5 परयुग, 6 परकुल, 7 परस्यकुल, 8 अमुष्यकुल, 9 सर्वजन, 10 विश्वजन, 11 महाजन, 12 पञ्चजन. ॥",

    "44103": "This debars यत् ॥ Thus गुडे साधुः = गौडिकः 'sugar-cane' lit. 'excellent in making sugar'. So कौलमाषिकः 'a kind of pulse' lit.

    "44105": "This debars यत् the difference being in accent (III. I. 3), and (VI. I. 185) Thus सभायां साधुः = सभ्यः꣡ 'refined' lit. fit for society.",
    "44106": "This debars य ॥ Thus सभेयः in सभेयोस्य युवा यजमानस्य वीरो जायताम् 'let a refined, youthful hero be born to this sacrificer'.",
    "44107": "The _anuvritti_ of साधुः now ceases. The word तीर्थ means here गुरु 'Preceptor'. Thus समाने तीर्थे वासी = सतीर्थ्यः (VI. 3. 87)-- 'a fellow-student', who both dwell under the same preceptor.",
    "44108": "The word शयित is equal to स्थितः 'remain'. Thus समानोदरे शयितः = समानोदर्यः 'uterine brother' i. e. who has slept in the same womb. See (VI. 3. 88).",
    "44109": "By _sutra_ (VI. 3. 88) समान is optionally changed to स before the word उदर when यत् follows. Thus समानोदरे शयितः = सोर्द॒॒यः꣡ ॥ Here ओ is not _udatta_, as it was in the last; the _udatta_ here falls on य ॥",
    "44110": "This debars अण्, घ &c (IV. 3. 53). Those affixes also are employed in the alternative, there being much latitude of grammatical rules in the Vedas. Thus the words मेघ्यः꣡ and विदुत्य॑ in the following hymn of the _Yajur_ _Veda_ (16. V. 38): नमा॒॒ मेघ्या॑य च विदुत्या॒॒य च॒॒ ॥ All the _sutras_ henceforward up to the end of the chapter, are Vedic _sutras_, the word छन्दसि being understood in them all.

So also यो नः सनु॑त्यः उत वा जिघन्तु thief lit. 'who stays in a concealed place', _sanuta_ meaning 'concealed' (see _Rig_ _Veda_ II. 31. 9).

    "44125": "This _sutra_ requires analysis. तद्वान् is formed by adding मतुप् to तद् meaning 'having that', and refers to a noun formed by the affix मतुप् ॥ The word आसाम् is genitive plural fem. of इदं meaning 'of them'; the pronoun refers to the word इष्टका ॥ The word उपधान means 'putting up', and technically means 'used as a _Mantra_ in the putting up of sacrificial bricks, pots &c'. मन्त्र \"sacred hymn\" इष्टका 'bricks'. The whole _sutra_ means \"the affix '_yat_' is used with the force of a genitive (_asam_), after a word which ends with _matup_ (_tadvan_), and denotes a _mantra_ used in putting up of sacrificial objects; when such _mantra_ refers to bricks : and when this affix _yat_ is added, the affix _matup_ is elided\". Thus वर्चस्वान्  is a _Mantra_ containing the word वर्चस् ॥ The bricks put up or collected (उपधीयते) with the recitation of वर्चस्वान् _Mantra_, will be called वर्चस्या (वर्चस्वत् + यत् = वर्चस् + यत् the affix वत् (मतुप्) being elided = वर्चस्य, fem वर्चस्या) ॥ Thus वर्चस्या उपदधाति 'he collects _Varchasya_ bricks i. e. on which _Varchasvan_ _mantra_ has been pronounced'. So तेजस्या उपदधाति ॥ So पयस्याः, रेतस्याः ॥\n\nWhy do we say तद्वान् ? The affix is not to be added to the whole _Mantra_. Why do we say, उपधान 'putting up'? The affix is not to be added to other _Mantras_ such as those used in praying etc. e. g. वर्चस्वानुपस्थान मन्त्र आसामिष्टकानाम्, here there will be no affix. Why do we say _Mantra_? Observe अंगुलिमानुपधानो हस्त आसाम् 'these bricks are collected with hand having fingers', here there will be no affix. Why do we say इष्टकासु ? Observe वर्चस्वानुपधानो मन्त्र एषां कपालानाम्, here there will be no affix, the thing collected being potsherds and not bricks.",
    "44126": "Thus अश्चिमानुपधानो मन्त्र आसामिष्टकानां = आश्चिनः fem. आश्चिनी ॥ The word is thus formed अश्चिमान् + अण् = अश्चि + अण् the _matup_ being elided (IV. 4. 125) = अश्विन् + अण् (VI. 4. 164) = आश्विन ॥ Thus आश्वि꣡नीरुपदधाति 'he collects _Asvin_ bricks i. e. bricks at the time of collecting which _Mantras_ containing अश्विन् were uttered. See _Yajur_ _Veda_ _Tait_ S. 5. 3. I. I.",
    "44127": "The word वयस्या means the bricks, the _Upadhana_ _mantras_ of which contain the word वयस् ॥ The affix मतुप् debars यत् ॥ A _mantra_ which contains both the word वयस् and मूर्धन्, that _Mantra_ is both वयस्वान् and मूर्धन्वान् ॥ Now in denoting sacrificial bricks put up with such a _mantra_, the affix यत् would have come by (IV. 4. 125) after both these words वयस्वान् and मूर्द्धन्वान् ॥ The present _sutra_ ordains मतुप् after मूर्द्धन्वान् ॥ Thus मूर्द्धन्व꣡तीरुपदधाति 'he collects _Murdhanvati_ bricks'. The words वयस्याः and मूर्द्धन्वत्यः denote the same object. See (VI. I. 176).\n\nWhy do we say वयस्यासु ? The affix '_matup_' will not be added to '_murdhan_', if the _Mantra_ contains only the word '_murdhan_' and not '_vayas_' also. In that case मूर्धन्याः will be the form, meaning 'bricks collected with the _Mantra_ containing the word मूर्धन्', while मूर्धन्वत्यः means 'bricks collected with the _Mantra_ containing the words _murdhan_ and _vayas_'.\n\nThe _sutra_ contains the word मूर्ध्नः ablative singular of मूर्धन् ॥ It ought to have been मूर्धन्वतः, for the affix _matup_ is added to मूर्धन्वत्, the यत् being elided then by (IV. 4. 125). The author has mentally elided the affix वत्, and shown in the aphorism the last stage of the word to which मतुप् is to be added.",
    "44128": "This debars the affix मतुप् and those having the sense of मतुप् ॥ Thus नभांसि विद्यन्ते यस्मिन् मासे = नभस्यः 'the month of clouds' i. e. June - July. So also सहस्य, तपस्यः मधव्यः, being the names of the months _Pausha_ (Nov-Dec), _Phalguna_ (Feb-March) and _Vaisakha_ (April-May). The word मधव्यः is thus formed:- मधु + यत् = मधा + यत् (VI. 4. 146) = मधव्यः (VI. 1. 79) 'the month of honey'. Similarly ओजस्या तनूः 'the bodies full of vigour'.\n\nWhy do we say \"in denoting a month or a body\"? Observe मधुमता  पात्रेण चरति, here मतुप् is used.\n\nVart:- The affix यत् is optionally employed when the sense is 'immediately after'. As मध्वस्मिन्नस्ति मध्वस्मिनन्तरमिति वा = माधव्यः or माधवो मासः ॥\n\nVart:- Sometimes the affix is elided, and sometimes the letters अ, इ and र serve the same purpose as this affix. Thus तपः or तपस्यः, नभस् or नभस्यः, सहस् or सहस्यः, all in the neuter gender in the _Chhandas_. Sometimes अ serves the same purpose, e. g. इषो मासः, ऊर्जोमासः ॥ Sometimes इ, as शुचिर्मासः. Sometimes र e. g. शुक्रो मासः ॥",
    "44129": "Thus माध॑वः or मधव्यः॑ ॥ Sometimes the affix is elided, as मधुः, all these mean the month of _Vaisakha_. So also माधवाः, मधव्या and मधुः meaning तनूः a body.",
    "44130": "Thus ओजस्य॑म् or ओजसी॒॒नं = अहः 'the day' lit. full of heat.",
    "44131": "The ल् of यल् shows that the accent falls on the vowel preceding the affix (VI. I. 193). Thus वेशोभगो विद्यते यस्य स = देशोभ꣡ग्यः 'strong-fortune' so also यशोभ꣡ग्यः 'famous-fortune'. The word वेश means strength': भग means 'fortune, desire, effort, greatness, virility and fame.' The word वेशोभगः may be taken as a _Dvandva_ compound of वेशस् 'force' and भगः 'fortune.' The word वेशोभग्यः would then mean 'possessed of power and fortune.'",
    "44132": "Thus देशोभगीनः and यशोभगीनः ॥ This _sutra_ has been separated from last in order to prevent the application of the यथासंख्य rule (I. 3. 10). For had the _sutra_ been वेशोयश आदेर्भगाद् यल्खौ, as it occurs in _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_, then the affix यल् would apply to देशोभग, and the affix ख to यशोभगः which is not what is intended. Another reason for making it a distinct aphorism is that the _anuvritti_ of ख runs in the next _sutra_, not so of यल् ॥",
    "44133": "The ख is read into the _sutra_ by force of the word च; the _anuvritti_ of मत्वर्थ ceases. Thus पूर्वैः कृतं = पूर्विणः 'made by the ancestors' i. e. a road. So also पूर्व्यः and पूर्वीणः ॥ The word पूर्वैः in the plural means पूर्वपुरुषाः \"past generations, ancestors\". These words occur generally in the plural, and mean \"roads widened by the forefathers\". Thus गम्भीरेभिः पथिभिः पूर्विणेभिः ॥ So also, ये ते पन्थाः सविताः पूर्व्यासः (_Rig_ I. 35. II) Another reading of this _sutra_ is पूर्वैः कृतमिनियौच; the affixes then will be इनि (इन्), and य; and ख will be drawn in by virtue of च ॥ The examples then will be पूर्विन्; 3rd pl. पूर्विभिः (with इन्), as पथिभिः पूर्विभिः, or पूर्वीणैः (ख) or पूर्व्यैः (य) ॥",
    "44134": "Thus अप्यम् 'offering purified with water'. As यस्येदमप्यं हविः ॥ The case of construction is indicated in the _sutra_ itself.",
    "44135": "The case of construction is indicated by the _sutra_. Thus सहस्रेण संमितः = सहस्रियः 'like unto thousand'. As in the following verse:- सहस्रिथासोऽपां नोर्मयः ॥ अयमग्निः सहस्रियः The word संमित means तुल्य 'equal to'. Some read the word समित instead of सम्मित, but the meaning will be the same.",
    "44136": "As सहस्रयस्य विद्यते = सहस्रियः ॥ This debars the मत्वर्थ affixes विनि and इनि and अण् of (V. 2. 102) and (V. 2. 103).",
    "44137": "Thus सोममर्हन्ति = सौम्या ब्राह्मणाः \"The _Brahmanas_ who deserve _Soma_\" i. e. honorable and learned, and worthy of performing sacrifices. The difference between यत् and घ is in accent.",
    "44138": "The force of the affix मयट् is that of ततः आगतः (IV. 3. 74) and (IV. 3. 82), विकारावयव (IV. 3. 134) and (IV. 3. 143) and प्रकृत (V. 4. 21). The case in construction will vary according to the sense. Thus सोम्यं मधुः पिबन्ति = सोममयः मधुः ॥",
    "44139": "Thus मधव्यान् स्तोकान् = मधुमयान् ॥",
    "44140": "Thus वसव्यः = समूहः 'a collection'.\n\nVart:- The affix '_yat_' comes without changing the sense, after the word छन्दस् when reference is made to the collection of letters. Thus the word छन्दस्यः in the following sentence: \"सप्तादशाक्षरश्छन्दस्यः प्रजापतियज्ञो मन्त्रे विहिता\". The 17 letters here referred to being ओ श्रावय, four; अस्तु श्रौषट्, four; यज, two; ये यजामहे five; and वषट् two ॥\n\nVart:- The affix यत् comes after वसु without changing the sense. As हस्तौ गृहीतस्य बहुभिर्वसव्यैः ॥ Here वसव्यैः is equal to वसुभिः ॥ Similarly अग्निरीशे वसव्यस्य = वसोः ॥",
    "44141": "The _anuvritti_ of समूह does not extend to this _sutra_. Thus नक्षत्रियेभ्यः स्वाहा = नक्षत्रेभ्यः स्वाहा ॥",
    "44142": "As सर्वतातिः and देवतातिः in the following hymns : \"सविता नः सुवतु सर्वतातिम् and प्रदक्षिणिद्देवतातिर्मुराणः ॥",
    "44143": "The word करः is equivalent to करोति formed by अच् (III. I. 134)\n\nThis shows that the construction must be genitive. With a _krit_-formed word, it has accusative force, as, शिवस्य करः = शिवं करोति ॥\n\nThus शिवस्य करः = शिवतातिः, So श॑तातिः and अरिष्टतातिः ॥ As याभिः॒॒ शन्ता॑ती॒॒ भव॑थो ददा॒॒शुषे॑ (_Rig_ I. 112. 20) शंताती being dual of शन्तातिः, and meaning सुखस्य कर्तारौ; so also अथो अरिष्टतातये ॥",
    "44144": "Thus शिवस्य भावः = शिवतातिः 'the condition of blissfulness'. शन्तातिः 'the state of happiness or peace', अरिष्टतातिः ॥ Here these words have the force of Verbal noun.",
    "51001": "The affix छ has the various senses taught in these thirty-seven _sutras_ (V. 1. 1.) to (V. 1. 37). Thus in the _Sutra_ तस्मैहितं 'suitable for that', (V. 1. 5). the word छ must be read to complete the sense. Thus वत्सेभ्योहितो = वत्सीयो गोधुक्, करभीय उष्ट्रः, अकरभीयः, अवत्सीयः ॥ The limitation of the jurisdiction of छ has been indicated in the _sutra_ with regard to the meaning of the affix, and not with regard to the affix. As an affix, छ has no force beyond _Sutra_ 17, the affix ठञ् being the ruling affix thereafter.",
    "51002": "The senses of _Prak_-_kritiya_ affixes are three viz, those taught in _sutras_ (V. 1. 5), (V. I. 12), and (V. 1. 16). This यत् debars छ ॥ Thus शङ्कवे हितं = शङ्क + यत् = शङ्कव्य (VI. 4. 146), (VI. I. 79). As शङ्कव्यं दारु, 'wood', 'fit for a stake' पिचव्यः कार्पासः ॥ So also कमण्डलव्या मृत्तिका 'earth' lit. 'fit for a water-pot'.\n\nSo also after गवादि words, e.g. गव्यम् 'suitable for cows', हविष्यम् 'suitable for offering'.\n\nThe words सनङ्गुः meaning 'a kind of leather', and चरुः 'a kind of हविः 'offering', and सक्तुः 'a kind of food', all end in उ and are governed by this _sutra_, in spite of (V. 1. 15) which applies especially to leathers, and (V. 1. 4) and its _vartika_ which applies especially to 'offerings' and 'food modifications'. This is an example where a subsequent _sutra_ does not debar a prior _sutra_ (I. 4. 2). Thus सनङ्गु + यत् = सनङ्गव्यं चर्म, 'leather fit for making _Sanangu_', चरु + यत् = चरव्या स्तण्डुलाः 'rice fit for making _charu_', सक्तु + यत् = सक्तव्या धानाः 'barley' fit for making _Saktu_'.\n\nIn the list of गवादि given hereunder, occurs नाभि नभं च, which means that नाभि is replaced by नभ when the affix यत् is added. Thus नाभये हितः = नभ्यः meaning अक्षः 'axis, axle' lit. 'fitted for the nave of the wheel'; or a wood fit to be made the nave of a wheel or अञ्जनम् the grease. When the word नाभि means 'navel' of a living being, then it will not take this यत्, but it will take the यत् of (V. 1. 6). In that case, नभ will not replace नाभि; e.g. नाभि + यत् = नाभ्यम् 'suitable for navel' i. e. oil.\n\nThe word श्वन् occurs in गवादि class. It takes _samprasarana_, व being changed to उ, and optionally this उ is lengthened; and the _udatta_ accent falls on the final. As श्वन् + यत् = शुन् + यत् = शुन्य꣡म् or शुन् + यत् = शून्य꣡म् 'fit for a dog'. Contrary to (V. 4. 144), the न् of श्वन् is not elided before the _taddhita_ affix वत् ॥\n\nThe word ऊधस् occurs in the गवादि class. Its final is replaced by अनङ्; e.g. ऊधस् + यत् = ऊध् + अन + य = ऊधन्यः कूपः गवादि 'a well'.\n\n1 गो, 2 हविस्, 3 अक्षर, 4 विष, 5 बर्हिस्, 6 अष्टका, 7 स्खदा (स्खद), 8 युग, 9 मेधा, 10 स्रुच् (स्रक्), 11 नाभि नभं च, 12 शुनः संप्रसारणं वा च दीर्घत्वं तत्संनियोगेन चान्तोदात्तत्वम्, 13 ऊधसोऽनङ् च, 14 कूप, 15 खद, 16 दर (उदर), 17 खर, 18 असुर, 19 अध्वन् (अध्वन; अध्वा) 20 सर, 21 वेद, 22 बीज, 23 दीप्त (दीस), 24 स्कन्द ॥",
    "51003": "This debars '_chha_'. Thus कम्बल + यत् = कम्बल्यं 'A _kambalya_-measure of wool' = 100 _Palas_ of wool. This is the name of a measure, such as कम्बल्यमूर्णा पलशतम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say संज्ञायां? Observe कम्बलीया ऊर्णा \"wool\" lit. 'fit for making blanket', which is formed by छ ॥",
    "51004": "Thus आमिक्ष्यं दधि \"fit for making आमिक्षा\" i. e. curd :- or आमिक्षीयं with छ ॥ So also पुरोडाश्याः or पुरोडाशीया स्तण्डुलाः, 'suitable for making _Purodasa_' i.e. a kind of rice. The word हवि occurs in the गवादि class (V. 1. 2) and it necessarily takes यत्, there being no option. The हवि here, therefore, means things denoting sacrificial offerings, and not the word-form '_havi_.'\n\nSo also after अपूपादि, as, अपूप्यम् or अपूपीयं, तण्डुल्यम् or तण्डुलीयं ॥\n\n1 अपूप, 2 तण्डुल, 3 अभ्यूष (अभ्युष), 4 अभ्योष, 5 अवोष, 6 अभ्येष, 7 पृथुक, 8 ओदन, 9 सूप, 10 पूप, 11 किण्व, 12 प्रदीप, 13 मुसल, 14 कटक, 15 कर्णवेष्टक, 16 इर्गल, 17 अर्गल, 18 अन्नविकारेभ्यश्च, 19 यूप, 20 स्थूणा, 21 दीप (पीप), 22 अश्व, 23 पत्र, 24 कट, 25 अयः स्थूण,\n\nVart:- The affix यत् comes optionally after words denoting modifications of food: such as सक्तु ॥ In the case of '_saktu_' however, no of option is allowed. See (V. 1. 2).",
    "51005": "Thus वत्सेभ्यो हितो गोधुक् = वत्सीयः 'fit for calves' i.e. a cow-milker. So अवत्सीयः, पटव्यम्, गव्यम्, हविष्यम्, अपूप्यम्, अपूपीयम् ॥",
    "51006": "The word शरीर means animal organism. This debars छ, thus, द꣡न्त्यम् 'good for the teeth.' क꣡ण्ठ्यम्, ओ꣡ष्ठ्यम्, ना꣡भ्यम्, न꣡स्यम् such as dentrifice, snuff, oil &c. See (VI. I. 213).",
    "51007": "This debars छ. Thus ख꣡ल्यम् 'suitable for threshing floor.' So also य꣡व्यम्, मा꣡ष्यम्, ति꣡ल्यम्, वृ꣡ष्यम् and ब्रह्मण्य॑म् ॥\n\nNo secondary derivatives can, however, be formed of the following वृष्णे हितम्, ब्राह्मणेभ्यो हितम्; the full phrases must be used in these cases, for these words take neither छ nor यत् though वृष is वृषन् and ब्रह्मन् is = ब्राह्मण ॥\n\nThe word च in the _sutra_ indicates that the rule applies to words other than those enumerated. Thus रथाय हिता = रथ्या ॥",
    "51008": "This debars '_chha_.' Thus अजथ्या यूथिः 'the yellow jasmine called _yuthi_' अविथ्या यूथिः ॥",
    "51009": "This debars छ ॥ In the _sutra_, the न् of आत्मन् has not been elided, indicating that it should not be compounded with the word भोग which would have been the case otherwise. It therefore follows from this irregular construction of the _sutra_, that the word भोगोत्तरपद does not apply to the words आत्मन् and विश्वजन, but these words are themselves _prakriti_. Thus आत्मन् + ख = आत्मनीनम् 'suitable for ones self' the न् of _atman_, which required to be elided by (VI. 4. 144), is saved by (VI. 4. 169). So also विश्वजनीनम् 'suitable for all men.' The word विश्वजन for must be a _karmadharaya_ compound, meaning 'all men,' for the application of this rule; when it is a _Tatpurusha_ or a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, it will take छ. As, विश्वजनाय हितं = विश्वजनीयम्, 'beneficial for man-kind.'\n\nVart:- So also after _Karmadharaya_ Compound पंचजन, e.g. पंचजनीनम्, otherwise पंचजनीयम् ॥\n\nVart:- After the _Karmadharaya_ compound सर्वजन, there are the affixes ठञ् and ख, as, सर्वजनीनं, and सार्वजनिकम्; otherwise सर्वजनीयम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ठञ् comes always after the word महाजन whether it be a _Karmadharaya_ or a _Tatpurusha_, but not so when it is a _Bahuvrihi_ Compound. As महाजनाय हितं = माहाजनिकं ॥ In a _Bahuvrihi_ it will be महाजनीयः with छ ॥\n\nCompounds having भोग as their final term, also take the affix ख, as, मातृभोगीणः and पितृभोगीणः ॥ The word भोग means 'body.' But मात्रीयः and पित्रीयः with छ, when the word भोग does not follow.\n\nVart:- The words राजा and आचार्य followed by '_bhoga_' take always the affix ख, as, राजभोगीनः and आचार्यभोगीनः ॥ In the case of आचार्यभोगीनः, the न is not changed into ण (VIII. 4. 2.) The words do not take the affix ख when used singly. As, राज्ञे हितम्, आचार्याय हितम्, no affix being employed.",
    "51010": "This debars '_chha_'. Thus सर्वस्मै हितं = सार्वम्. So also पौरुषेयम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ण comes optionally after सर्व, as, सर्वीयम् or सार्वम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ढञ् comes after पुरुष when the word so formed means: 'slaughter', 'modification', 'a crowd', or 'made by him'. As पौरुषेयो वधः &c. 'man-slaughter', 'a crowd of men', 'human action', 'made by man'. e.g. पौरुषेयो ग्रन्थः 'a book written by man' contra. अपौरुषेया वेदाः 'The Vedas are non-human'.",
    "51011": "This debars छ. As माणवाय हितं = माणवीनम्. So also चारकीणम् ॥",
    "51012": "The word प्रकृति means 'primitive or the material cause of a product', The word विकृति means 'the product' or 'modification of such primitive' तदर्थे 'serviceable for that' i. e. 'the primitive being serviceable for the product'. The word तदर्थे shows that the primitive must be serviceable for that particular product and nothing else. That is to say, an affix will not come to denote any product in general, but only when the primitive is serviceable for a particular product and nothing else. The word तदर्थ shows also that the word must be in the 4th case, when the affix is added. Some read the words तस्मै हितं also into this _sutra_.\n\nThus अङ्गारेभ्यो हितानि एतानि काष्ठानि = अङ्गारीयाणि काष्ठानि 'wood serviceable for making charcoal;' so also प्राकारीया इष्टकाः 'bricks serviceable for making a wall'. Here अङ्गारीय and प्राकारीय are formed by छ (V. I. 1). Similarly शङ्कव्यं दारु 'wood serviceable for a spear.', पिचव्यः कार्पासः 'cotton plant serviceable for cotton'.\n\nWhy do we say तदर्थम् 'serviceable thereto'? Observe यवानां धानाः, धानानां सक्तवः ॥ Here there is modification of primitive, but सक्तु is the product also of other things than धानाः such as लाजा &c.\n\nWhy do we say विकृतेः 'after a product'? Observe उदकार्थः कूपः, there is no affix. For कूपः 'a well' and उदक 'water' do not stand in the relation of and प्रकृति and विकृति i.e. material cause and effect. As 'water' is not the modification or product of 'the well, though it is found in the well, and therefore, the affix is not employed.\n\nWhy do we say प्रकृतौ 'to denote a primitive'. Observe अस्यर्था कोशी 'a sheath serviceable for a sword'. The sword is a product of iron, but a sheath is not the primitive of the sword. \n\nBy using the words प्रकृति and विकृति it is further shown that the _prakriti_ is liable to modification or _vikara_.",
    "51013": "This debars छ. Thus छादिषेयाणि तृणानि, औषधेयं दारु, बालेयास्तण्डुलाः ॥\n\nThe affix comes after the word उपाधि without changing the sense. उपधीयत इत्युपधिः = रथांगम् 'part of a wheel between the nave and the circumference or the wheel istelf'. The word औषधेय also means the same.",
    "51014": "Thus आर्षभ्यो वत्सः, औपानह्योः मुञ्जः ॥ This '_nya_' debars '_chha_'. Even when the primitive is 'leather चर्म', the affix '_nya_' will come after उपानह् irregularly debarring अञ् of (V. 1. 15). Thus औपानह्यं चर्म ॥",
    "51015": "The word चर्मणः in the aphorism is in the genitive case. This अञ् debars छ. Thus वार्द्ध्रं चर्म and वारत्रं चर्म a leather serviceable for making a '_vardhra_' and '_varata_' i.e. a leather thong.",
    "51016": "The word तद् shows that the word in construction must be in the Ist case, the words अस्य 'of it' and अस्मिन् 'in it' show the senses of the affix, the word स्यात् 'it can be' qualifies the primitive, the word इति is for the sake of distinctness. Thus प्राकार आसाम् इष्टकानां स्यात् = प्राकारीया इष्टकाः 'the bricks sufficient to raise a wall'. So also प्रासादीयं दारु ॥ Similarly प्राकारोऽस्मिन्देशे स्यात् = प्राकारीयो देशः 'a place sufficient to make a wall therein'. प्रासादीया भूमिः ॥\n\nThe word स्यात् being in the Potential Mood (विधि लिङ्) of अस् 'to be,' has the force of संभावन 'potentiality, sufficiency' as given in _Sutras_ (III. 3. 154) &c. Such as when the large number of bricks makes it possible to raise a wall, we say प्राकार यासामिष्टकानां स्यात् ॥ Similarly when the quality (गुण) of a land, such as its area, situation &c, makes it possible to erect a palace therein, we say, प्रासादो स्मिन्देशे स्यात् ॥\n\nIn the examples under this _sutra_, there is no modification (विकार) of the primitive (प्रकृति) into a product, as was the case under _sutra_ (V. 1. 12). The examples under this _sutra_ show merely the 'adequacy, fitness or sufficiency' of a thing for a certain purpose. Herein lies the difference between this _sutra_ and the previous ones.  \n\nThe repetition of the word तद् twice in this _sutra_ shows the existence of this Grammatical maxim: अनेकस्मिन् प्रत्ययार्थे प्रत्येकं समर्थ विभक्तिः संबन्धनीयः 'when the sense of an affix is more than one, the case in construction to which the affix must be added must be shown in each case.'\n\nWhy there is no affixing in this case: प्रासादो देवदत्तस्य स्यात् ? The use of इति in the _Sutra_ would prevent this, the force of इति being that the secular usage must be looked to in forming these derivatives.",
    "51017": "This debars छ. Thus पारिखेयी भूमिः 'land sufficient to make a mote thereon'.\n\nUp to this _Sutra_ was the governing force of the affixes छ and यत् ॥ Hereafter another affix will be taught.",
    "51018": "The affix ठञ् governs all the succeeding _sutras_ upto तेन त्य्ल्यं क्रिय चेद्वात, and has the senses given to it in _Sutras_ (V. 1. 37) &c. Strictly speaking the affix ठञ् governs only upto (V. 1. 110) and not upto (V. 1. 115). Thus in _Sutra_ (V. 1. 72), the affix ठञ् must be read as पारायणिकः, तौरायणिकः, चान्द्रायणिकः ॥",
    "51019": "_Karika_\n\nऊर्ध्वमानं किलोन्मानं परिमाणं तु सर्वतः ।\nआयामस्तु प्रमाणं स्यात्संख्या बाह्या तु सर्वतः ॥\n\nStrictly speaking ठक् governs upto _sutra_ (V. 1. 65). The word आर्हाद् is made up of आ + अर्हात् The force of आ here is अभिविधि or inclusive, so that in the _Sutra_ तदर्हति (V. 1. 63) also, the ठक् will be employed. The affix ठक् debars ठञ् ॥ The sense will be the same as given in (V. 1. 37) &c. the difference between ठक् and ठञ् being in accent only. Thus निष्कया क्रीतं = नैष्किकम्, So also पाणिकम् ॥\n\nBut गोपुच्छेन क्रीतम् = गोपुच्छिकम्, the accent falling on गौ; so also with words denoting Numbers and Measures, as षाष्टिकम्, प्रास्थिकम्, कौडविकम् ॥\n\nThe word परिमाण in this _sutra_ has its technical signification, and not its etymological sense. Technically परिमाण does not include संख्या, etymologically it does. _Panini_ has used this word परिमाण  in some _sutras_ in its technical sense, in others in its etymological sense. Thus in _sutras_ (IV. 1. 22), and (V. 1. 19) the technical sense is taken, while in _sutras_ (IV. 3. 156) and (V. 1. 57) the etymological sense is meant. Technically परिमाण means सर्वतो मानं or a measure of capacity, and surface namely length and breadth and height or depth, such as प्रस्थः &c, i.e. a cubic measure and a square measure. In this sense it is to be distinguished from the measures of length or lineal measure, technically called प्रमाण, such as a वितस्त्य 'a cubit' &c, on the one side, and the measures of weight, technically called उन्माण such as पल, &c on the other side. In short उन्मान means a measure of weight or gravity, परिमाण means a measure of volume or capacity, प्रमाण means a lineal measure, and a संख्या is beyond all these.",
    "51020": "The word आर्हात् is understood in this _sutra_ also. This ठक् debars ठञ्. Thus नैष्किक꣡म्, पाणिक꣡म्, पादिक꣡म्, माषिक꣡म् ॥\n\nWhy do we say असमासे 'when not compounds'? Observe प꣡रमनैष्किकम् उ꣡त्तमनैष्किकम् formed by ठञ् (V. I. 18.) Compare (VII. 3. 17) by which the _Vriddhi_ of the second term takes place and not of the first.\n\nQ. Is not the employment of the word असमासे in the _Sutra_ redundant? For by the maxim ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति \"that which cannot possibly be anything but a _pratipadika_, does, contrary to (I. 1. 72), not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself;\" the _pratipadika_ निष्क being especially mentioned in the _sutra_, the rule will apply to the word निष्क and not to a word ending with निष्क ॥\n\nA. The employment of the word असमासे in this _Sutra_, indicates by implication _jnapaka_), that in spite of the above maxim, the तदन्तविधिः (I. 1. 72) applies in the previous _sutras_, while in the subsequent _sutras_ its does not. As उगवादिभ्यो यत् (V. 1. 2), the यत् applies not only to गो &c but to words ending in गो &c. As गव्यम् and सुगव्यम्, अतिसुगव्यम् ॥ Not only अपूप्यम् अपूपीयम् (V. I. 4.) but also यवापूप्यम्, यवापूपीयम् ॥ Not only दन्त्यम् (V. 1. 6.) but also राजदन्त्यम् ॥\n\nWhile in the _sutras_ subsequent to this (V. 1. 20), the _tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies only to words preceded by a _Sankhya_ and that also in _Sutras_ upto (V. 1. 115) and not there after as, द्वैपारायणिकः and त्रैपारायणिक (V. 1. 72). Even in this latter case, when an affix is elided by लुक् the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ does not apply. Thus द्वाभ्यां शूर्पाभ्यां क्रीतं = द्वि शूर्प + ठञ् (V. I 18) = द्विशूर्पम्, the affix being elided by (V. 1. 28). Now in forming a tertiary derivative from this word द्विशूर्पम्, the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ will not apply. Thus द्विशूर्पेण क्रीतं, here what affix are we to subjoin? If _tadanta_ _vidhi_ applied, we get the affix अञ् (V. 1. 26) in the alternative. But _tadanta_ _vidhi_ not applying, we get the general affix ठञ् (V. 1. 8) and have द्विशौर्पिकम् ॥ Here the affix ठञ् is not elided by (V. 1. 28), as there is no _Dvigu_ compounding. The above rule is summarised in the following _ishti_ प्राग्वतेः संख्यापूर्वपदानां तदन्तग्रहणमलुकि ॥\n\nThe words 1. निष्क, 2. पण, 3. माष, 4. वाहद्रोण and 5. षष्टि belong to निष्कादि class.",
    "51021": "The word आर्हात् (V. 1. 19) is understood here also. These affixes ठन् and यत् debar the affix कन् (V. 1. 22). Thus शतेन क्रीतम् = शत्यम् or शतिकम् 'purchased for a hundred gold coins'.\n\nWhy do we say अशते when not meaning 'merely a hundred'? Observe शतं परिमाणमस्य = शतकं निदानम् 'a band whose measure is hundred'. The word अशते qualifies the sense of the affix, and not that of the base, the latter not being possible; for the word शत as a base must always mean 'a hundred'. The following examples will illustrate the meaning; शतमध्यायाः परिमाणमस्य ग्रन्थस्य = शतकः 'a book consisting of hundred _Adhyayas_'. In this case there is essentially no difference between the base (_prakriti_) and the sense of the affix (_pratyayartha_), though there is apparent difference, for the sake of applying the affix. For शतकः is a book essentially consisting of hundred: while शत्यं 'a carriage purchased for a hundred coins', does not contain hundred as its essential part. Similarly शतको गोसंघः 'a herd of cows hundred in number'. Here the संघः essentially consists of शत and so there is the affix कन् and not ठन् or यत् (V. 1. 58). But not so in the case of शत्यं शाटकशतं, शतिकं शाटकशतं, for here the sense of the affix is formed by the sentence, and not discovered merely from the word. Hence the following _Vartika_ शतप्रतिषेधेऽन्यशतत्वेऽप्रतिषेधः ।\n\nThe word च in the _sutra_ draws in the word असमासे from the previous _sutra_. Thus द्वौ च शतं च = द्विशतं, द्विशतेन क्रीतं = द्विशतकम् 'purchased for a hundred and two coins'. Here the affix is कन् (V. 1. 22). So त्रिशतकम् ॥ According to the _Ishti_ given in the last _Sutra_, the _tadanta_ _vidhi_ applies here.",
    "51022": "The word आर्हात् is to be read into this _sutra_ also. The word संख्या is defined in (l. 1. 23). This कन् debars ठञ् ॥ Thus पंचभिः क्रीतः = पंचकः, बहुकः, गणकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when it does not end in ति or शत्'? Observe सा꣡प्ततिकः चा꣡त्वारिशतकः formed by ठञ् ॥ But why कतिकः is formed by कन् and not by ठञ् or ठक्, as the word कति also ends in ति? The word कति is formed by adding the affix डति, while the rule applies to the numerals which in their primitive state end with ति such as सप्ततिः, अशीतिः, विंशति &c. Here apply the two maxims अर्थवद्ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य 'a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote the same combination of letters void of a meaning;' and निरनुबन्धक ग्रहणे न सानुबन्धकस्य 'when a term void of _Anubandhas_ is employed in Grammar, it does not denote that which has an _Anubandha_ attached to it'. Therefore when ति is taken, it does not mean डति॥",
    "51023": "The words ending in वत् are संख्या; see (I. 1. 23): and would consequently take कन् by (V. 1. 22). The present _sutra_ ordains the optional affixing of इट् to this कन् ॥ Thus तावत्कः or तावतिकः, यावतिकः or यावत्कः ॥",
    "51024": "Thus विंशति + ड्वुन् = विंश + अक (VI. 4. 142) = विंशक; त्रिंशत् + ड्वुन् = त्रिंश् + अक (VI. 4. 143) = त्रिंशकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say असंज्ञायाम् 'when not denoting a Name'? Observe, विंशतिकः, त्रिंशत्कः formed by affix कन् (V. 1. 22). Q. Why do you affix कन्, when it is prohibited by the phrase अतिशदन्तायाः; for विंशति ends in ति and त्रीशत् ends in शत् ? The affix कन् will be added by dividing the _sutra_ into two: viz: (1) विंशतित्रिंशद्भ्यां (2) ड्वुनसंज्ञायाम्; the meanings being (1) The affix '_Kan_' is added to _vinsati_ and _trinsat_; (2) The affix _dvun_ is added to the same words, when not denoting a name.",
    "51025": "This debars ठञ्; the _anubandha_ टि of टिठन् shows that the feminine of the word will be formed by ङीप् (IV. 1. 15), the इ of टि is for the sake of pronunciation, the न् of टिठन् is for accent (VI. 1. 197). Thus कंसिकः fem. कंसिकी ॥\n\nVart:- So also it must be stated after the word अर्ध; e. g. अर्द्धिकः, अर्धिकी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word कार्षापण, e. g. कार्षापणिकः fem. कार्षापणिकी ॥ Sometimes the word प्रति is substituted for कार्षापण before this affix, as, प्रतिकः fem. प्रतिकी ॥",

Thus अध्यर्द्धकंसम्, द्विकंसम्, अध्यर्द्धशूर्पम्, द्विशूर्पम्, त्रिकंसम् , त्रिशूर्पम् ॥ Here the affixes टिठन् and अञ् are elided.\n\nThough in the words द्विशूर्पम् &c. the affix is elided, it is only so when the affixing of the _taddhita_ occasions a _Dvigu_ compounding (II. 1. 51) such as in द्वाभ्यां शूर्पाभ्यां क्रीतं = द्विशूर्पम् ॥ Here the resultant is a _Dvigu_ compound. But in forming tertiary derivatives the affix is not elided, as द्विशूर्पेण क्रीतं = द्विशौर्पिकम् ॥ Hence the following rule: द्विगोर्लुकि तन्निमित्तग्रहणम् ॥ See (IV. 1. 88), (V. 1. 20.) ॥\n\nWhy do we say असंज्ञायाम् 'when not a Name'? Observe पांचलोहितिकम् or पंचलौहितिकम् and पांचकलायिकम् being names of certain measures. The feminine word लोहिनी is changed into the masculine by the _Vartika_ भस्याढे तद्धिते given under (VI. 3. 35).\n\nThe word अध्यर्द्ध is a _Sankhya_ (See (I. 1. 23)), and a word beginning with it will be a _Dvigu_ compound. Its separate mention in this _sutra_ may appear superfluous. It is however so mentioned, in order to indicate (_jnapaka_) that this word is not always a _Sankhya_. Thus for the purposes of the application of the affix कृत्वसूच् (V. 4. 17), this word is not a _sankhya_.",
    "51029": "This _sutra_ makes the elision optional, when it was compulsory by the last _sutra_.

When it is not elided, प्रति may be substituted for कार्षापण (V.

    "51035": "This debars ठञ् which also comes in the alternative, and is then elided by (V. I. 28).

    "51037": "The thirteen affixes ठञ्, ठक्, ठन्, यत्, कन्, ड्वुन्, टिठन्, अञ्, अण्, ख, ईकन्, यत् and अण् have already been taught. Now is taught their sense, and the case in construction of the word to which they should be added. The तेन shows that the word must be in the 3rd case in construction : and क्रीतम् shows that the sense is that of 'purchased'. The illustrations have already been given in the previous _sutras_. Some more may be mentioned here. Thus सप्तत्याक्रीतं = साप्ततिकम्, आशीतिकम्, नैष्किकम्, पाणिकम्, पादिकम्, माषिकम्, शत्यम्, शतिकम्, द्विकम्, त्रिकम् &c.\n\nThe affix will come after a word in the 3rd case in construction when it means 'price,' and the force of the 3rd case is that of 'instrument' (II. 3. 18) and not that of 'agent.' Therefore, there is no affixing in the words देवदत्तेन क्रीतं or पाणिना क्रीतं ॥\n\nNor does the affix come after a dual or a plural. Thus प्रस्थाभ्यां क्रीतं or प्रस्थैः क्रीतं, there is no affixing, as it is not the idiom. But द्वाभ्यां क्रीतं = द्विकम्, त्रिकम्, पंचकम्, मुद्गैः क्रीतं = मौद्गिकम्, माषिकम्. Here there is affixing after a dual and plural, for the words द्वि, त्रि are essentially dual or plural, and in the case of मुद्गः and माषः, those are always used in the plural, for it is not possible to purchase anything with a single grain of मुद्ग or माषः ॥",
    "51038": "The word तस्य shows that the word in construction must be in the 6th case, the word निमित्तं 'cause or occasion' gives the sense of the affix; संयोग means 'a connection, or relation': उत्पातः means 'a portend indicative of good or bad luck.' Thus शतस्य निमित्तं धनपतिना संयोगः = शत्यः 'a connection with a rich man for the sake of getting a hundred.' So also शतिकः, साहस्रः ॥ So also शतस्य निमित्तमुत्पातो दक्षिणाक्षिस्पन्दनम् = शत्यम्, शतिकम्, साहस्रम् \"the twitching of the right eye for the sake of a hundred\" i. e. indicative of acquiring or losing a hundred, a thousand &c.\n\nVart:- The above affixes come after the words वात, पित्तं, and श्लेष्म in the senses of allaying or vitiating. As वातिकम् 'allaying or vitiation of windy humour.' So also पैत्तिकम्, श्लेष्मिकम् ॥\n\nVart:- Also after the word सन्निपात, as, सान्निपातिकम् ॥",
    "51039": "This debars ठञ्. As गो निमित्तं संयोग उत्पातो वा = ग꣡व्यः 'a connection or a portent for the sake of a cow.' So also after a word of two syllables, as, ध꣡न्यम्, स्व꣡र्ग्यम्, यशस्य॑म्, आयुष्य॑म् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not a word denoting a Numeral, or a Measure of capacity or अश्व &c\"? Observe पंचानां निमित्तं = पंचकम्, सप्तकम्, अष्टकम्; प्रास्थिकम् खारीकम्, आश्विकः formed by (V. I. 22), (V. I. 18), (V. I. 19).\n\nVart:- The word ब्रह्मवर्च्चस should be enumerated : eg. ब्रह्मवर्च्चसस्य निमित्तं गुरुणा संयोगः = ब्रह्मवर्च्चस्यम् \"relationship with a teacher in order to acquire _Brahmavarchasa_.\"\n\n1 अश्व, 2 अश्मन्, 3 गण, 4 ऊर्णा, 5 उमा, 6 गङ्गा (भङ्ग भङ्गा), 7 वर्षा (वर्ष), 8 वसु. ॥",
    "51040": "The word पुत्र being a dissyllabic word would always have taken यत् by the last aphorism. This ordains छ also. Thus पुत्रस्य निमित्तं संयोग उत्पातो वा = पुत्रीयम् or पुत्र्यम् ॥",

    "51042": "Thus सर्वभूमेरीश्वरः = सार्वभौमः 'the lord of the whole earth', पार्थिवः 'the lord of the earth'.\n\nThe word तस्य, showing the genitive construction of the base, has been repeated in this _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ was running into it from (V. 1.38); in order to show that the senses given in (V. 1. 38) do not extend further. Had तस्य not been repeated here, the word ईश्वरः would have been an attribute, like the words संयोग and उत्पात, of the word निमित्तः ॥",
    "51043": "The word विदितः means known published &c. सर्वभूमौ विदितः = सार्वभौमः known in the whole world. So also पार्थिवः ॥",
    "51044": "Thus लोके विदितः = लौकिकः, सार्वलौकिकः ॥ The irregular _Vriddhi_ of both members takes place by (VII. 3. 20).",
    "51045": "The word वापः means 'sown therein' i. e. a field. Thus प्रस्थस्य वापः क्षेत्रं = प्रास्थिकम् 'sown with a _Prastha_', द्रौणिकम्, खारीकम्, i. e a field sown with a quantity of grain measuring a _Prastha_ or a _Drona_ or a _Khari_.",
    "51046": "This debars ठञ्. The न् of ष्ठन् is for accent (VI. 1. 197), the ष् is for ङीष् (IV. 1. 41). The word पात्र denotes a measure of capacity. Thus पात्रस्य वापः = पा꣡त्रिकं क्षेत्रम्, fem पात्रिकी꣡ क्षेत्रभक्तिः ॥",
    "51047": "The affix is added to a word in the first case (तद्) in construction. The sense of the affix is that of a locative (अस्मिन्). The word दीयते 'is given' in the singular number joins with each one of the word वृद्धि, आय &c. The sum paid by a debtor to his creditor over and above the principal, is called वृद्धि or interest. The share of profit taken by landlord in villages &c. is called आय or rent. The increase over the capital by sale of cloth &c. is called लाभ or profit. The share of the king for protection &c. is called शुल्क or tax. The present or bribe is called उपदा ॥ Thus पंचास्मिन् वृद्धिर्वा आयो वा लाभो वा शुल्को वा उपदा वा दीयते = पंचकः 'that transaction &c. in which five percent is given as interest, rent, profit tax or bribe'. Similarly सप्तकः, शत्यः, शतिकः, साहस्रः &c.\n\nVart:- So also in the sense of a Dative. As पंचास्मै वृद्धिर्वा आयो वा लाभो वा उपदा वा दीयते = पंचको देवदत्तः \"_Devadatta_ to whom five percent is given as Interest &c\". This _Vartika_ may be redundant, if we take the locative as sometimes having the force of dative also. As in the sentence सममब्राह्मणे दानं ॥",
    "51048": "This debars ठक् and टिठन् ॥ Thus द्वितीयो वृद्ध्यादिरस्मिन् दीयते = द्वितीयिकः, तृतीयिकः, पंचमिकः, सप्तमिकः, अर्द्धिकः ॥ The word अर्द्ध is technically the name of रूपकार्ध ।",
    "51049": "By the word च in the _sutra_  ठन् also comes. This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus भागो वृद्ध्यादिरस्मिन् दीयते = भाग्यं or भागिकं शतम्; भाग्या or भागिका विंशतिः ॥ The word भाग also denotes रूपकार्ध ॥",
    "51050": "The case in construction here is accusative (तद्). Thus, वंशभारं हरति, वहति आवहति वा = वांशभारिकः, कौटजभारिकः, बाल्वजभारिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after भार\"? Observe वंशं हरति, no affixing. Why do we say \"preceded by वंश &c\". Observe व्रीहिभारं हरति, no affixing.\n\nAccording to another explanation, the phrase भाराद् वंशादिभ्यः is explained as भारभूतेभ्यो वंशादिभ्यः. Then the _sutra_ will mean \"the above named affixes come after वंश &c. when they denote a load\". Thus भारभूतान् वंशान् हरति = वांशिकः; कौटजिकः, बाल्वजिकः ॥ Why do we say \"when denoting a load भार\"? Observe वंशं हरति ॥ Why do we say after वंश &c.? Observe भारभूतान् व्रीहीन् वहति ॥ Both these explanations are valid and traditional.\n\nThe word हरति means to carry to another place or to steal; वहति means to carry on ones back or head, आवहति means to produce or bring.\n\n1 वंश, 2 कुटज, 3 बल्वज, 4 मूल, 5 स्थुणा, (स्थुण), 6 अक्ष, 7 अश्मन्, 8 अश्व, 9 लक्षण, 10 इक्षु, 11 खट्वा ॥",
    "51051": "Thus वस्नं हरति वहति वा = वस्निकः, द्रव्यकः ॥",
    "51052": "The word तद् is understood here, showing that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the accusative. The word संभव means the capacity to hold the exact quantity; अवहार means 'taking away, or containing.' Thus प्रस्थं संभवति = प्रास्थिकः 'a vessel capable of holding a _Prastha_ measure.' So प्रस्थमवहरति or पचति = प्रास्थिकः 'a vessel or a person that takes away, holds or cooks a _Prastha_ measure.' Similarly क्रौडविकः and खारीकः ॥ The word संभव does not govern the word पचति, thus प्रस्थं पचति ब्राह्मणी = प्रास्थिकी _Brahmana_ who cooks a _Prastha_'.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् also comes after the word द्रोण in the sense of 'who cooks that' e.g. द्रोणं पचति ब्राह्मणी = द्रौणी or द्रौणिकी ॥",
    "51053": "This ख debars ठञ् which comes in the alternative. Thus आढकं संभवति, अवहरति, पचति वा = आढकीना or आढकिकी, आचितीना or आचितिकी, पात्रीणा or पात्रिकी ॥",
    "51054": "The ख is read into the _sutra_ by the word च of the aphorism. These two affixes ख and ष्ठन् being especially ordained, are not to be elided by (V. 1. 28). But when in the alternative, we add the general affix ठञ्, then it is elided by (V. 1. 28). The न् of ष्ठन् is for accent (VI. 1. 19). and the ष् for ङीष् ॥ Thus we have 3 forms:- द्व्याढकिकी, द्व्याढकीना, or द्व्याढकी; द्व्याचितिकी, द्व्याचितीना, द्व्याचिता. In this case of द्व्याचिता the feminine is not formed by ङीप् (IV. 1. 21) because of the specific prohibition contained in (IV. 1. 22). So also द्विपात्रिकी, द्विपात्रीणा and द्विपात्री ॥",
    "51055": "By च the affix ष्ठन् is also added. The elision being optional, the affix ठञ् (V. I. 18) may optionally be elided by (V. 1. 28). Thus we get four forms: द्विकुलिजिकी (ष्ठन्), द्विकुलिजीना (ख), द्विकुलिजा (ठञ् लुक्), द्वैकुलिजिकी (ठञ्) ॥ In the last example, there is not _vriddhi_ of the second term, though it was so required by (VII. 3. 17). The anomaly is explained by holding that the word कुलिज should be included in the exception along with संज्ञा and शाण of (VII. 3. 17).",
    "51056": "The सः shows that the case in construction is nominative. The word अंश means 'share,' वस्न means 'price,' भृति means 'wages.' Thus पंच अंशो वस्नो वा भृतिर्वास्य = पंचक 'whose portion, price or pay is five.' So सप्तकः, साहस्रः ॥",
    "51057": "The word तद् shows that the word in construction should be in the nominative case. Thus प्रस्थः परिमाणमस्य = प्रास्थिको राशिः 'a heap whose mass is a _Prastha_.' So also खारीकः, शत्यः, शतिकः, साहस्रः, द्रौणिकः, कौडविकः, वार्षशतिकः, वार्षसहस्रिकः ॥ So also षष्ठिर्जीवित परिमाणमस्य षाष्ठिकः, द्विसाप्ततिकः ॥\n\nWhy the words तदस्य have been repeated in this _sutra_, when their _anuvritti_ could have been drawn from the last aphorism, the word सोऽस्य and तदस्य being the same? The repetition shows that the affixes are again ordained, so that the elision taught in (V. 1. 28) does not apply. Thus द्वे षष्ठी परिमाणमस्य = द्विषाष्ठकः, द्विसाप्ततिकः, ॥ Here the affix is not elided by (V. 1. 28).",
    "51058": "The phrase तदस्य परिमाणं is understood here. The word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the nominative case. When it is a Name, the affix does not change the sense of the radical. Thus पंचकाः = पंचः 'the Five' as पंचका शकुनयः, त्रिकाः 'the Three' = शालङ्कायनाः ॥ The sense of the primitive is changed when it means संघ 'a multitude or flock'; as पंचकः संघः, अष्टकः ॥ So also when it means a सूत्र 'a Book', as, अष्टावध्यायाः परिमाणमस्य सूत्रस्य = अष्टकं पाणिनीयम् 'The _Ashtaka_ of _Panini_ viz, a Book comprising Eight _Adhyayas_'. So also वैयाघ्रपदीयम्, त्रिकं काशकृत्स्नम् ॥ Is not a collection of _Adhyayas_ the same as संघः ? No, the word संघः is confined to a collection of living beings only.\n\nThe word अध्ययन means 'study'. Its numerical measure (संख्या परिमाण) means the particular number of times, or ways in which it should be read. Thus पंचकोऽधीतः 'what is studied five-times or in five modes' सप्तकोऽधीतः so also अष्टकः or नवकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ड comes after the words पंचदश &c, when the word means a _Stoma_. As, पंचदश मन्त्राः परिमाणमस्य = पंचदशः स्तोमः, सप्तदशः स्तोमः &c. The indicatory ड् causes the elision of final (टि) by (VI. 4. 143), in the cases of words like एकविंशः &c. In the case of पंचदशः the न् is elided by (VI. 4. 141).\n\nVart:- The affix डिनि comes in the _Chhandas_ after words ending in शत् and शन्, as, पंचदशिनोर्द्धमासाः, त्रिंशिनो मासाः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word विंशति, as विंशिनोऽङ्गिरसः ॥",
    "51059": "The words तदस्य परिमाणम् are understood here also : पंक्ति is formed by adding ति to पंच, the final being elided, meaning 'a verse the measure of which is five', i. e. a half-quarter consisting of 5 syllables. The word विंशति is formed by adding शतिच् to the word विन् which replaces the two word द्वयोदशतः as द्वौ दशतौ परिमाणमस्य संघस्य = विंशतिः ॥ So the affix शत् comes after त्रिन् representing त्रयोदशतः; so for चतुर्णो दशतां we have चत्वारिम् and then add शत्, similarly with पंचाशत् ॥ Similarly with the rest.\n\nNote:- All the rest appears to be the conjectural etymology of _Patanjali_ and _Kasikakara_, and hence it is omitted.\n\nThe word पंक्ति also means 'a line'. As ब्राह्मणपङ्क्तिः, पिपीलिका पंक्तिः ॥ Here the sense has no relation to its etymology.",
    "51060": "This ordains डति instead of कन् (V. 1. 22), which also comes in the alternative. As पंचद्वर्गः, दशद्वर्गः or पंचकोवर्गः, दशकोवर्ग ॥",
    "51061": "As सप्त साप्तान्यसृजन् ॥ The phrase तदस्य परिमाणं is understood here.",
    "51062": "The word वर्ग does not govern this _sutra_. The indicatory ड् causes the elision of the last vowel with the consonant that follows it (VI. 4. 143). The force of the locative case in ब्राह्मणे is that of अभिधेय and not विषय, i. e. when the word means a _Brahmana_ itself. Had the force been that of विषय, it would have meant, 'in the _Brahmana_ literature'. As त्रिंशदध्यायाः परिमाणमेषां ब्राह्मणानां = त्रैंशानि ब्राह्मणानि 'The _Brahmana_ containing thirty _Adhyayas_'. So चत्वारिंशानि ब्राह्मणानि ॥ These being the names of certain _Brahmanas_.",
    "51063": "The case in construction here is accusative. Thus  श्वेतच्छत्रमर्हति = श्वेतच्छत्रिकः \"who deserves the White Umbrella\". So also वास्त्रयुग्मिकः, शत्यः, शतिकः साहस्रः ॥",
    "51064": "Thus छेदं नित्यमर्हति = छैदिकः, so also भैदिकः ॥\n\n1 छेद, 2 भेद, 3 द्रोह, 4 दोह, 5 मर्त (वर्त), 6 कर्ष, 7 तीर्थ, 8 संप्रयोग, 9 विप्रयोग, 10 प्रयोग, 11 विप्रकर्ष, 12 प्रेषण, 13 संप्रश्न, 14 विप्रश्न, 15 विकर्ष, 16 प्रकर्ष, 17 विराग विरङ्गं च (from विराग is formed वैरङ्गिक), ॥",
    "51065": "Thus शिरश्छेदं नित्यमर्हति = शीर्षच्छेद्यः, or शैर्षच्छेदिकः ॥ The word शिरस् is changed irregularly into शीर्ष before the affix.",
    "51066": "The word नित्य does not govern this _sutra_. This य debars ठक् (V. 1. 19). Thus दण्डमर्हति = दण्ड्यः 'deserving to be killed'. मुसल्यः &c.\n\n1 दण्ड, 2 मुसल, 3 मधुपर्क, 4 कशा, 5 अर्घ, 6 मेघ, 7 मेधा, 8 सुवर्ण, 9 उदक, 10 वध, 11 युग, 12 गुहा, 13 भाग, 14 इभ, 15 भङ्ग, ॥\n\nNote.- The _Sidhanta_-_Kaumudi_ gives the sutra as दण्डादिभ्यो यत्; another version gives the _sutra_ as दण्डादिभ्यः only drawing the affix यत् from the last _sutra_.",
    "51067": "This debars ठञ् &c. Thus उदक्या वृत्तयः, यूप्यः पलाशः, गर्त्यो देशः ॥ See (VI. 1. 213).",
    "51068": "This debars ठक् and ठञ् ॥ The word पात्र denotes measure also. Thus पात्रमर्हति = पात्र्यः or पात्रियः ॥",
    "51069": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus कडङ्करमर्हति = कडङ्करीयः or कडङ्कयः 'one deserving straw' such as a cow. So also दक्षिणीयः or दक्षिण्यो ब्राह्मणः 'a _Brahmana_ deserving alms.'",
    "51070": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus स्थालीबिलीयास्तण्डुलाः or स्थालीबिल्याः 'rice deserving the pot' i. e. cookable rice.",
    "51071": "This debars ठक् ॥ Thus यज्ञियो ब्राह्मणः 'a _Brahmana_ worthy of honor at a sacrifice.' आर्त्विजीनो ब्राह्मणः ॥\n\nVart:- After the words _yajna_ and _ritvija_, these affixes have also the sense of \"deserving the performance thereof\". Thus यज्ञकर्मार्हति = यज्ञियो देशः 'a place fit for the performance of sacrifice.' ऋत्विक् कर्मार्हति = आर्त्वजीन ब्राह्मणकुलम् ॥\n\nHere ends the governing power of ठक् (V. 1. 19): hence forward is the government of ठञ् (V. 1. 18).",
    "51072": "The force of अर्हति ceases. Thus पारायणिक श्छात्र 'a pupil, who reads under a teacher': तौरायणिको यजमानः, चान्द्रायणिकस्तपस्वी ॥ The word पारायण means a 'teacher' (परस्य करोति) ॥",
    "51073": "Thus संशयमापन्नः प्राप्तः = सांशयिकः स्थाष्टः \"a doubtful pillar\", i.e. in a precarious state.",
    "51074": "Thus योजनं गच्छति = यौजनिकः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the words क्रोशशत and योजनशत. As क्रौशशतिकः, यौजनशतिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix after these two words means also \"who is worthy to be approached from so far\". As क्रोशशतादभिगमनमर्हति = क्रौशशतिको भिक्षुः, यौजनशतिक आचार्यः ॥",
    "51075": "Of the affix ष्कन्, ष् is for ङीष् (IV. 1. 41), and न् for accent (VI. 1. 197.) As पन्थानं गच्छति = प꣡थिकः fem. पथिकी꣡ ॥",
    "51076": "The word नित्य qualifies the sense of the affix. Thus पन्थानं नित्यं गच्छति = पान्थः as पान्थो भिक्षां याचते ॥ Why नित्यं ? See पथिकः ॥",
    "51077": "The construction of the _sutra_ shows that the base must be in the 3rd case. The word च shows that the word गच्छति 'who passes by that way' should also be read into the aphorism. Thus उत्तरपथेनाहृतं = औत्तरपथिकम् or उत्तरपथेन गच्छति = औत्तरपथिकः ॥\n\nVart :- So also after the word पथ preceded by the words वारि, जङ्गल, स्थल, कान्तार the affix has the sense of 'conveyed by that way' or 'passing by that way'. As वारिपथेनाहृतः = वारिपथिकम्, वारिपथेन गच्छति = वारिपथिकः, so also जाङ्गलपथिक, स्थालपथिक, कान्तारपथिक, masculine or neuter according as the affix means conveyed or passing.\n\nVart:- So also after the words अजपथ and शंकुपथ as, अजपथेनाहृतं गच्छति वा = आजपथिकः, शांकुपथिकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अण् comes after the word स्थलपथ when the thing conveyed or brought means 'honey' or 'pepper'. As स्थालपथं मधुकं, स्थालपथं मरिचम् ॥",
    "51078": "The word कालात् bears rule in the following aphorisms upto (V. 1. 96) inclusive. Thus the next _sutra_ तेन निर्वृत्तम् means 'accomplished by means thereof'. We must read the word काल into it. As मासेन निर्वृत्तम् = मासिकम् &c.",
    "51079": "Thus अह्ना निर्वृत्तं = आह्निकम् \"to be accomplished in a day\" i. e. a certain portion of reading &c, आर्धमासिकम्, सांवत्सरिकम् ॥",
    "51080": "The word अधीष्ट means \"honorary office\", therefore 'one solicited to teach, but who accepts no pay' (III. 3. 161), भृतः means \"engaged on wages\", भूतः means 'the time pervaded or occupied by its existence', and भावी the same as last in the future. The word denoting time will be in the second case by (II. 3. 5). Thus मासमधीष्टः = मासिकोऽध्यापकः, so also मासंभृतः = मासिकः कर्मकरः, मासंभूतः = मासिको व्याधिः, मासंभावी = मासिक उत्सवः ॥\n\nQ. The solicitation (अध्येषण) and hiring (भरण) only take a short time, how can these acts extend over a month ?\n\nA. It is not these acts, but their results which extend over a month, such as, teaching and serving.",
    "51081": "This debars ठञ् ॥ The word भूतः of the previous _sutra_ should be read into this. Thus मासंभूतः = मास्यः or मासीनः 'a month old'.\n\nWhy do we say when denoting 'age'? Observe मासिकः ॥",
    "51082": "Thus द्वौ मासौ भूतः = द्विमास्यः, त्रिमास्यः ॥",
    "51083": "Thus षाण्मास्यः, षण्मास्यः, and षाण्मासिकः ॥",
    "51084": "The च draws in the affix ण्यत् also. Thus षण्मासिकः or षाण्मास्यो रोगः 'a disease lasting six months'.",
    "51085": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus समामधीष्टो, भृतो भूतो भावी वा = समीनः ॥ Some say, the sense of the affix is तेन निर्वृत्तम् (V. 1. 79), as समया निर्वृत्तः = समीनः ॥",
    "51086": "In the alternative ठञ् will also apply. The _Vartika_ taught in (V. 1. 20) (प्राग्वतेः संख्यापूर्वपदानां तदन्तग्रहणमलुकि) applies here also. Thus द्विमासीनः or द्वैमासिकः, त्रिमासीनः or त्रैमासिकः ॥",
    "51087": "In the alternative ठञ् will also come. Thus द्विरात्रीणः, द्वैरात्रिकः, द्व्यहीनः (VI. 4. 145) or द्वैयह्निकः, द्विसंवत्सरीणः, द्विसांवत्सरिकः (VII. 3. 15).",
    "51088": "The affix ख as well as ठञ् come in the five fold senses (V. 1. 79), (V. 1. 80), after the word वर्षा forming a _Dvigu_; and these two affixes may also be elided optionally. Thus we have three forms; द्विवर्षीणो, द्विवार्षिकी or द्विवर्षो व्याधिः 'a disease that lasted two years'. Compare (VII. 3. 16); but when the sense is that of भावी, the form will be द्वैवर्षिकः ॥",
    "51089": "Here the elision is compulsory and not optional as in the last. Thus द्विवर्षो दारकः 'a boy two years old'. Why do we say चित्तवति \"when meaning endowed with reason\" ? Observe द्विवर्षीणो व्याधिः ॥",
    "51090": "The word षष्टिकाः may be said to be formed by adding कन् to षष्टिरात्रि in the 3rd case in construction, then eliding the word रात्रि, the force of the affix being 'matured'. Thus षष्टिरात्रेण पच्यन्ते = षष्टिकाः 'a kind of barley'. It is a name of barley and therefore does not apply to pulse, beans &c, though they may also ripen in six days.",
    "51091": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus इद्वत्सरीयः, इदावत्सरीयः ॥",
    "51092": "Thus संवत्सरीणः and संवत्सरीयः, परिवत्सरीणः and परिवत्सरीयः ॥",
    "51093": "Thus मासेन परिजय्यः (शक्यते जेतुं) = मासिको व्याधिः, सांवत्सरिको व्याधिः, मासेन लभ्यः = मासिकः पटः, मासेन कार्यं = मासिकं चान्द्रायणं, मासेन सुकरो = मासिकः प्रासादः ॥",
    "51094": "The word तद् shows that the word must be in the accusative case. अस्य shows the force of the affix, ब्रह्मचर्य्यः joins both. Thus मासं ब्रह्मचर्य्यमस्य = मासिको ब्रह्मचारी “who practises abstinence for a month\". So also आर्धमासिकः, सांवत्सरिकः ॥\n\nAnother explanation is, the affix _than_ comes after a word in the first case in construction, when the sense is that of an abstinence which lasts for such a period. As मासोऽस्य ब्रह्मचर्यस्य = मासिकं ब्रह्मचर्यम् \"an abstinence lasting for a month\". आर्धमासिकं, सांवत्सरिकं ॥\n\nIn the first case the affix relates to a person, in the second, to the vow itself. Both these explanations are valid, as the structure of the aphorism is open to both constructions.\n\nVart:- So also after the words महानाम्नी &c in the genitive construction. As महानामिकम्, गौदानिकम्, आदित्यव्रतिकम् ॥\n\nVart:- After those words, the affix means also 'who practises that'. As महानाम्नीश्चरति = माहानामिकः, आदित्यव्रतिकः, गौदानिकः ॥ महानाम्नी + ठञ् = महानामन् + ठञ् ((VI. 3. 35) _Vart_) = माहानामिकः (VI. 4. 144). महनाम्न्य ऋचः, तत् सहचरितं व्रतं ॥\n\nVart:- The affix डिनि comes after the words अदान्तरदीक्षा &c, in the sense of 'who practices'. As अवान्तरदीक्षांचरति = अवान्तरदीक्षी, तिलव्रतिन् ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes ड्वुन् and डिनि come after the word अष्टचत्वारिंशत्, as अष्टचत्वारिंशद्वर्षाणि व्रतं चरति = अष्टचत्वारिंशकः or अष्टचत्वारिंशिन् ॥\n\nVart:- The same affixes come after the words चतुर्मास्य &c, the final य being elided. As चतुर्मास्यानि चरति = चातुर्मासकः or चातुर्मासिन् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ण्य comes after चतुर्मास, in the sense of 'produced there'. As चतुर्षु मासेषु भवानि = चातुर्मास्यानि ॥ It refers to a sacrifice.\n\nVart:- The affix अण् comes, when it is a Name, as, चतुर्षु मासेषु भवा = चातुर्मासी पौर्णमासी ॥ So also आषाढी, कार्तिकी, फाल्गुनी ॥",
    "51095": "As अग्निष्टोमस्य दक्षिणा = आग्निष्टोमिकी, वाजपेयिकी, राजसूयिकी ॥\n\nThe word आख्या in the _sutra_ implies that the affix comes even after those sacrifice-denoting words which do not express time (V. 1. 78); had it not been used, the _sutra_ would have applied only to such sacrifice-denoting words as एकाहः, द्वादशाह, which are time-denoting words as well. The _Vartika_ in (V. 1. 20) would apply to द्वादशाह &c. Some texts do not read च in the _sutra_.",
    "51096": "As मासे भवम् = मासिकं (IV. 3. 11). This word also means मासे दीयते and मासे कार्यं ॥ Similarly सांवत्सरिकं, प्रावृषेण्यं (IV. 3.17), वासन्तिकम् (IV. 3. 20), वासन्तम् (IV. 3. 16), हैमनम् (IV. 3. 22), हैमन्तम् (IV. 3. 16), हैमन्तिकम् (IV. 3. 21), शारदम् (IV. 3.16). All these words mean also what is given or done in those seasons. The word वत् in भववत् means that all the rules of तत्रभवः (IV. 3. 53) apply here.\n\nThis _sutra_ should be divided into two parts, one joining with the previous _sutra_, as तत्र च दीयते, यज्ञाण्येभ्यः, as आग्निष्टोमिकं भक्तं, राजसूयिकम्, वाजपेयिकम् ॥\n\nSo far does the word काल (V. 1.78), bear rule. Hereafter general affixes will be taught.",
    "51097": "Thus व्युष्टे दीयते कार्यं वा = वैयुष्टम्, नैत्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the words अग्निपद &c. As, आग्निपदम्, पैलमूलम् ॥ This _Vartika_ can be dispensed with, as the word अग्निपद &c can be included in the व्युष्टादि list of words.\n\n1 व्युष्ट, 2 नित्य, 3 निष्क्रमण, 4 प्रवेशन, 5 उपसंक्रमण, 6 तीर्थ, 7 अस्तरण (आस्तरण), 8 संग्राम, 9 संघात, 10 अग्निपद, 11 पीलुमूल (पीलु, मूल), 12 प्रवास, 13 उपवास, 14 संभ्रम, 15 दीर्घ. ॥",
    "51098": "The words दीयते and कार्य apply to both; the rule of यथासंख्यः (1. 3. 10) not applying to it. The word यथाकथाच is an Indeclinable, meaning contempt. Of course this word cannot take any case-affix, it therefore only gives the sense of third case. As यथाकथाच दीयते कार्यं वा = याथाकथाचम्, हस्तेन दीयते कार्यं वा = हस्त्यम् ॥",
    "51099": "The word संपत्तिः means 'suitable, proper, it'. The word संपादिन् is formed by adding णिनि to संपद्, the force of the affix being that of necessity (III. 3. 170). As कर्णविष्टकाभ्यां संपादि मुखं = कार्णयेष्टकिकं मुखं 'a face fit for earrings'. वास्त्रयुगिकम् शरीरम् i. e. वस्त्रयुगेन विशेषतः शोभते ॥",
    "51100": "This debars _than_. कर्मणा संपद्यते = कर्मण्यं शरीरम्, वेषेण संपद्यते = वेष्यो नटः ॥ For accent see (VI. 1. 213).",
    "51101": "The word प्रभवति means 'able, capable'. The dative here has the force of अलम् (II. 3. 16). As, संतापाय प्रभवति = सांतापिकः, सान्नाहिकः ॥\n\n1 संताप, 2 संनाह, 3 संग्राम, 4 संयोग, 5 संपराय, 6 संवेशन, 7 संपेष, 8 निष्पेष, 9 सर्ग, 10 निसर्ग, 11 विसर्ग, 12 उपसर्ग, 13 प्रवास, 14 उपवास, 15 संघात, 16 संवेष, 17 संवास, 18 संमोदन, 19 सक्तु, 20 मांसौदनाद्विगृहीतादपि, 21 असर्ग. ॥",
    "51102": "Thus योगाय प्रभवति = योग्यः or यौगिकः ॥",
    "51103": "This debars ठञ्. As कर्मणो प्रभवति = कार्मुकं धनुः ॥ This word कार्मुकम् means always a 'bow', and is never employed to designate anything else.",
    "51104": "Thus सामयिकं कर्म = 'a work for which the time has come'.",
    "51105": "As ऋतुःप्राप्तोऽस्य = आर्त्तवं पुष्पम् (_Guna_ by (VI. 4. 146)) \"the flower for which the season has arrived\".\n\nVart:- So also after the words उपवस्त्र &c. As औपवस्त्रम्, प्राशित्रम् ॥",
    "51106": "This debars अण्. As अयं ते योनिरृत्वियः ॥ Here there is no _Guna_ by (VI. 4. 146), because by _sutra_ (1. 4. 16), ऋतु before the affix घस् gets the designation of पद, hence the _guna_ rule which applies to भ (1.4. 18) does not apply.",
    "51107": "As काल्यस्तापः, काल्यं शीतं ॥ See (VI. 1. 213).",
    "51108": "As प्रकृष्टो कालोऽस्य = कालिकमृणम् \"long-standing debt\". कालिकम् वैरम् \"long-standing enmity\".\n\nIn this _sutra_ काल and तदस्य are understood, but not so the word प्राप्तम् ॥",
    "51109": "As इन्द्रमहः प्रयोजनमस्य = ऐन्द्रमहिकम्, गाङ्गामहिकम् ॥",
    "51110": "As वैशाखो मन्थः, आषाढो दण्डः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the words चडा &c. As चडा प्रयोजनमस्य = चौडम्, श्रद्धा प्रयोजनमस्य = श्राद्धम् ॥",
    "51111": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus अनुप्रवचनं प्रयोजनमस्य = अनुप्रवचनीयम्, उत्थापनीयम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the derivatives formed by the affix अन (यु) from the radicals विश्, 'to enter', पूर, 'to fill', पत् 'to fall', and रुह 'to mount', when preceded by a word. As गृहप्रवेशनीयम्, प्रपापूरणीयम्, अश्वप्रपतनीयम्, प्रासादारोहणीयम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix यत् comes after the words स्वर्ग &c. स्वर्गं प्रयोजनमस्य = स्वर्ग्यम्, यशष्यम्, आयुष्यम्, काम्यम्, धन्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix is elided after the words पुण्याहवाचन &c. As, पुण्याहवाचनं प्रयोजनमस्य = पुण्याहवाचनं, स्वस्तिवाचनं, शान्तिवाचनम् ॥\n\n1 अनुप्रवचन, 2 उत्थापन, 3 उपस्थापन, 4 संवेशन, 5 प्रवेशन, 6 अनुप्रवेशन, 7 अनुवासन, 8 अनुवचन, 9 अनुवाचन, I0 अन्वारोहण, 11 प्रारम्भण, 12 आरम्भण, 13 आरोहण, 14 अनुवेशन, 15 अनुवादन, 16 प्ररोहण ॥",
    "51112": "This debars ठञ् ॥ Thus छन्दः समापनं प्रयोजनमस्य = छन्दः समापनीयम्, व्याकरण समापनीयम् ॥ The specific mention of the word पद in the aphorism indicates that the rule will not apply when a word other than a '_pada_,' such as the affix '_bahuch_,' (V. 3. 68.) precedes the word _Samapana_.",
    "51113": "The feminine will be in ङीप्. Thus एकागारं प्रयोजनमस्य = ऐकागारिकः fem. °की ॥ This word can be regularly formed by ठञ्, but it will always be restricted to mean a thief. When any other thing is designated, it will not take this affix. Thus एकागारं प्रयोजनमस्य भिक्षाः, here there will be no affixing. The feminine moreover will be in ङीप् ॥ Some say the word is formed by adding the affix इकट् with the irregular _Vriddhi_ of the first syllable.",
    "51114": "The word आकाल is substituted for समानकाल.

    "52006": "The word दर्शनः means that in which something is seen, such as, looking glass, mirror &c, which reflect things. The word यथामुख is an _Avyayibhava_ compound, the meaning of यथा being that of likeness (II. 1.6).

    "52008": "The word प्रपद means 'the top of the foot'. आ means \"upto\". आप्रपद is an _Avyayibhava_ compound meaning 'to the top of the foot'. Thus आप्रपदं प्राप्नोति = आप्रपदीनः पटः 'cloth reaching to the end of the feet', i.e. showing the width of the cloth by comparison with the body.",
    "52009": "Thus अनुपदं बद्धा = अनुपदीना 'a kind of shoe'; this word is always feminine. The force of अनु here is that of 'length' or 'likeness'. That is 'a shoe of the measure of a foot'. So सर्वान्नानि भक्षयति = सर्वान्नानोभिक्षुः 'a mendicant who eats the whole food'. So also अयानयीनः शारः 'a chessman or piece that is taken to the position on the chess called _ayanaya_'. The word अयानय is compounded of two words अय, meaning 'going from right to left', and अनय 'from left to right', and it means a particular position in which the pieces moving from right to left and left to right cannot move further, and attack the other pieces.\n\nAccording to some अयानयीन is the name of the front pieces in ones own row of chess-men. A piece which moves only in one side, does not admit of this affix. The piece which is carried from one side to another, admits of this affix. Others move only in one direction अय or अनय, but not both. _Kaiyyata_: यस्तु शार एक पार्श्य एव संचरति तत्र न भवति प्रत्ययो, यो हि शारः पार्श्वात् पार्श्वान्तरमानीयते, स एव अयानयं नीयते, अन्यास्तु अयमेव नीयते, अनयमेव नीयते वा ॥",

The word परम्पर is compounded of पर and परतर the compounding being caused by the affix. As, परांश्च परतरांश्चानुभवति = परम्परीणः ॥ Similarly पुत्रपौत्रीणः ॥\n\nThe word परम्पर is a separate word as well, not formed by or admitting this affix. As मन्त्रिपरम्परा मन्त्रं भिनत्ति ॥",
    "52011": "The word गामी means 'गमिष्यति', see (III. 3. 3). The genitive case is prohibited by (II. 3. 70): the word गामी governing the accusative.

As पारावारीणः ॥ So also when the words are taken separately as, अवारीणः and पारीणः ॥\n\nSo also अत्यन्तं गामी = अत्यन्तीनः = भृशं गन्ता ॥ As अनुकामीनः = यथेष्टं गन्ता ॥",
    "52012": "The word विजायते means गर्भे धारयति 'who bears in the womb'. This verb governs the accusative of time समांसमां by (II. 1. 29). Thus समांसमां विजायते = समांसमीना गौः, समांसमीना वडवा ॥\n\nVart:- According to others the aphorism means 'the affix comes in the sense of to give birth to or to get a young'. i.e. विजायते = गर्भमोचनं ॥ According to them, the verb governs the locative: समायां समायां विजायते = समांसमीना, the य् of the first समायां being elided, the rest of the _vibhakti_ (आम्) remaining. The word will mean \"an animal that gives birth to a young one every year\".\n\nVart:- Sometime there is no affixing, but the whole sentence is to be used to express this meaning, or the य् only of both members is to be elided and a sentence formed. As समां समां विजायते or समयां समयां विजायते ॥",
    "52013": "The word विजायते is understood here. The word अवष्टब्ध means 'imminent, near'. It is formed by अव + स्तंभ + क्त, the स् being changed to ष् by (VIII. 3. 68). Thus अद्य वा श्वो वा विजायते = अद्यश्वीना गौः \"a cow likely to give birth to-day or to-morrow\". So also अद्यश्वीना वडवा ॥\n\nSome do not read विजायते into the _sutra_, which then means \"The word _adyasvina_ is irregularly formed meaning imminent\". As अद्यश्वीनं मरणं 'imminent death'. अद्यश्वीनो वियोगः 'separation likely to take place to-day or tomorrow'.",
    "52014": "This word is formed by adding ख to the word गो preceded by the preposition आ, as आगो + ख = आगवानः ॥ The force of the affix is that of 'a servant'. A person who is engaged in business till the return of the cows, i.e. a day-labourer.",
    "52015": "Thus the word अनुगु means गो पश्चाद् ॥ Thus अनुगु पर्याप्तं गच्छति = अनुगवीनः 'who is suited or able to follow after the cows' i.e. a cowherd.",
    "52016": "Thus अध्वानमलंगामी = अध्वनीनः or अध्वन्यः 'able to undertake a journey'. By aphorisms (VI. 4. 168), (VI. 4. 169), the word अध्वन् retains its original form before the affix य and ख, not losing its final अन् which it does before other affixes, by (VI. 4. 144).",
    "52017": "The च् draws in यत् and ख. Thus अभ्यमित्रं अलंगामा = अभ्यमित्रीयः, अभ्यमित्र्यः, अभ्यमित्रीणः 'an warrior who valiantly encounters his enemy' = अमित्राभिमुखं सुष्ठु गच्छति ॥",
    "52018": "The word गोष्ठ is a compound of गो + स्था i.e. a cow-pen, it means the place all around a cow-pen. The word भूतपूर्व qualifies it. Thus गोष्ठो भूतपूर्वः = गौष्ठीनो देशः 'a place which was formerly a _Goshtha_'. Otherwise when not meaning formerly, we have गोष्ठो वर्तते ॥",
    "52019": "The word अश्वस्थ being in the sixth case shows the construction it should have before the affix. The एकाहगमः means एकाहेन गम्यते i.e. what is or can be gone over in one day.

    "52020": "The word अधृष्ट means 'not proud', अकार्यम् means 'unfit to be done' i. e. an infamous act. The words come from शाला \"a hall\" and कूप 'a well'. It is not easy to trace any connection between 'modesty' and 'a hall', or between 'shameful' and 'a well'. However some say शालाप्रवेशनमर्हति 'who deserves to enter a hall', = शालीनः, कूपावतारमर्हति 'who deserves to be thrown into a well' = कौपीनः, hence a thing to be concealed, and the dress that conceals it. As शालीनो जडः, कौपीनं पापं ॥",
    "52021": "The word व्रात means a multitude or mass composed of various castes, who have no fixed employment, and live by violence, or by bodily labor. व्रातेन जीवति = व्रातीनः 'a person who lives by the labour of his body, not of his brain'.",
    "52022": "The word साप्तपदीन comes from सप्तपद but the connection of senses is not very clear. It is said सप्तभिः पदैरवाप्यते = साप्तपदीनम् \"formed by walking together seven steps or by talking together seven words\". The circumambulation of the Fire by the bride and bridegroom in seven steps makes the marriage irrevocable. साप्तपदीनं seems to have some connection with that. The word साप्तपदीनः or म् means 'a friend' also; the abstract sense being made applicable by analogy to the person as well.",
    "52023": "The word हैयङ्गवीनम् means 'fresh butter'. The word comes from ह्यः 'yesterday' and गो 'cow'. ह्यो गोदोहस्य विकारः 'prepared from yesterday's milk' i.e. \"fresh butter\". The affix does not come in the sense of any विकार in general. There is no affixing in ह्यो गोदोहस्य विकार when it means उदश्चित् or 'whey'.",
    "52024": "The word तस्य shows that the construction must be genitive. The affix कुणप् comes after पील्वादि words, signifying 'ripening', and the affix जाहच् comes after कर्णादि words signifying the 'root'.\n\nThus पीलूनां पाकः = पीलुकुणः, कर्कन्धुकुणः, so also कर्णस्य मूलं = कर्णजाहम्, अक्षिजाहम् ॥\n\n1 कर्ण, 2 अक्षि, 3 नख, 4 मुख, 5 केश, 6 पाद, 7 गुल्फ, 8 भ्रू, 9 शृङ्ग (भ्रूभङ्ग ! भ्रूशृङ्ग), 10 दन्त, 11 ओष्ठ, 12 पृष्ठ, 13 नख, 14 अङ्गुष्ठ ॥\n\n1 पीलु, 2 कर्कन्धु (न्धू), 3 शमी, 4 करीर, 5 कुवल, 6 बदर, 7 अश्वत्थ, 8 खदिर ॥",

This form is thus evolved; यत् + वतुप् = यावत् (the _ti_ अत् being replaced by आ by (VI. 3. 91) = यावन्त (the नुम् being added by (VII. 1.70)) = यावान्त (the अ being lengthened by (VI. 4. 41)); the _vibhakti_ सु being elided by (VI. 1. 68), and त् being elided by (VIII. 2. 23) we get finally यावान्, तावान्, एतावान् ॥ The परिमाण is used in this _sutra_, in order to distinguish it from the word प्रमाण used in the last aphorism (See (V. 1. 19)). Therefore यत्, तद् & एतद् take the affixes '_matra_' &c also in the sense of प्रमाण, which would not have been the case, had परिमाण not been used in the _sutra_, for then the special affix वतुप् would have debarred _matrach_ &c in the case of यत् &c. The word डावतु in the _karika_ is the name given to this affix वतुप् by the ancient grammarians; so that according to them there was no necessity of (VI. 3. 91) to replace टि of यत् &c, by आ; thus यत् + डावतु = यावत् ॥\n\nMoreover the affix वतुप् being added in the sense of परिमाण, (capacity ) only after यत् &c, it follows that the words so formed, may take the further affix मात्रच् &c in the additional sense of प्रमाण (length); which would not have been the case had the word परिमाण not been used in the _sutra_. Thus तत् परिमाणमस्य = तावद् as धान्यं राशीकृतं । From this तावत् we have तावत् प्रमाणमस्य कुड्यादेः = तावन्मात्रम् meaning यावद् राशीकृतस्य धान्यस्य दैर्घ्ये, तादृग् अस्यापि ॥\n\nVart:- The affix वतुप् comes in the sense of 'like this', after the words युष्मद् and अस्मद् in the _Chhandas_.

    "52040": "Thus किम् + वतुप् की + वतुप् (VI. 3. 90) = क् + घतुप् (VI. 4. 148) = कियत् nom. कियान्. Similarly इयत् nom. इयान् ॥",
    "52041": "The च introduces the affix वतुप् which is changed into घतुप् (इयत्) ॥\n\nThe word संख्यापरिमाणे means संख्यायाः परिमाणं i.e. संख्यापरिच्छेदः 'making estimate by numbers'. As का संख्या परिमाणमेषां ब्राह्मणानां = कति ब्राह्मणाः or कियन्तो ब्राह्मणाः 'how many _Brahmanas_ in number do you estimate these'. This always comes in the plural.\n\nThis word is formed, in fact, when a question is put relating to the numerical quantity (_sankhya_-_parimana_) of any thing. But the word _sankhya_-_parimana_ may be explained also as a _Karmadharaya_, in which the attributive word has been placed second. It will then mean \"quantitative number\". The _sutra_ will be rendered thus: \"_kim_ takes _dati_, when it means a quantitative number\". It should not be objected that numbers are always quantitative, and therefore _parimana_ is redundant in the aphorism. For sometimes numbers are used not to define any quantity but merely to mark contempt. As in the following:-\n\nअव्रतानाममन्त्राणां जातिमात्रोपजीविनाम् । सहस्रशः समतानां पारषत्वं न विद्यते॥ Here the word सहस्रशः is used indefinitely in a contemptuous sense. Therefore, it is not true that a number always defines a quantity. Where किम् is used to express contemptuous number, no affixing takes place : as केयमेषां संख्या दशानाम् ॥ The word _parimana_ in this _sutra_ is not used in its technical sense; as in _Sutra_ (V. 2. 39) _ante_: for its very repetition here shows that it is used here to denote 'quantity' in general, and not 'capacity', for a number cannot mean 'capacity'.",
    "52042": "The word तदस्य is understood here. Thus पंच अवयवा अस्य = पंचतयम् 'having five parts'. The part being connected with the whole, the force of the affix is to denote the whole. So also दशतयम्, चतुष्टयम्, चतुष्टयी (VIII. 3. 101) and (IV. 5. 15)",
    "52043": "As द्वाववयवावस्य = द्वयम् or द्वितयम्, त्रयम् or त्रितयम् 'a couple' 'a triad' (VI. 4. 148).\n\nThe word तय is used in the _sutra_ to indicate the _sthanin_ or thing to be replaced. Had it not been used, the _sutra_ would have run thus द्वित्रिभ्यामयज् वा \"_ayach_ optionally comes after _dvi_ and _tri_\". Here _ayach_ would have become a separate affix, instead of being a mere substitute. Where is the harm in its being a separate affix? Then the word त्रयम् or द्वयम् will not form their feminine in ङीप्; but अय being taken as _sthanivat_ to तय (1. 1. 56), the affix ङीप् which by (IV. 1. 15), applies to तय, applies to अय also. Thus we have त्रयी गतिः ॥ Moreover by (I. 1. 33), words ending in तय are declined as Pronouns optionally before nominative plural termination. By the rule of _sthanivat_ _adesa_ (I. 1. 56), the words ending in अय will also be Pronouns. As द्वये or द्वयाः त्रये or त्रयाः ॥ The च् in अयच् is for accent, showing that the substitute '_aya_' differs in accent from the _sthani_ _taya_.",
    "52044": "The affix अय꣡च् having indicatory च् takes the acute accent on the final syllable (VI. 1. 163), i. e. on य, the special mention of the _udatta_ in the  _sutra_ shows that the accent should be on a syllable which would otherwise not have taken it i. e. the first syllable i. e. अ; for had this not been the meaning, there was no necessity of using the word _udatta_ in the _sutra_.\n\nIf उभ is a _Sankhya_ word (1. 1. 23) in the secular sense, it would have taken तयप्, the present _sutra_ ordains अय꣡ instead as a substitute always. If it is not a _Sankhya_, then we should first ordain तयप् after it, by the process of splitting the _sutra_ (V. 2. 42) _ante_ into two, thus संख्यायाः तयप्, अवयवे तयप् and then replace तयप् by अय꣡ ॥\n\nThus उभौ पीतलोहितौ अवयवौ यस्य = उभयः ॥ उभ꣡ये देवमनुष्याः; उभ꣡योः मणिः ॥",

The sense of the aphorism is \"after a Numeral in the first case in construction (तद्), with the force of a genitive (अस्य), comes the affix मयट्, when the word in the first case in construction denotes the value (निमान) of a portion (गुण)\". The word गुण means भाग or \"portion\", and निमान means 'price'. In comparing the quality of one thing with another, निमान is the value or price. Thus यवानां द्वौ भागौ निमानमस्योदश्विद्भागस्य = द्विमयमुदश्विद्यवानाम् \"two parts of _Yava_ is the price of one part _Udasvit_\". Similarly त्रिमयम्, चतुर्मयम्, lit. \"_Udasvit_ is द्विमय or 'two-times' the value of _yava_\".\n\nThe word गुणस्य is in the singular number. The comparison must therefore be made with one portion of a thing, with the several portions of the other. The ratio must be x:1, but never x:2, or x:3 &c. Therefore the rule does not apply here, द्वौ भागौ यवानां त्रय उदश्वितः ॥ The x also must be more than one. The rule therefore does not apply here: एको भागो निमानमस्य ॥\n\nThe word गुण denotes an integral number, therefore the rule will not apply to fraction. As द्वौ भागौ यवानामध्यर्द्ध उदश्वितः ॥\n\nThe affix also comes in the sense of purchasing or the comparative value of a thing, i. e. in denoting the thing received in exchange (निमेय) As उदश्वितो द्वौ भागौ निमेयमस्य यवभागस्य = द्विमयाः, as द्विमया यवा उदश्वितः = उदश्वितो द्वौ गुणौ निमेयौ येषामेकगुणानां यवानां \"the exchange value of _Udasvita_ is twice as much as that of a _Yava_\". The word निमान means the thing given in exchange; and निमेय the thing received in exchange. Both words are reciprocal and are terms of barter or exchange, but they do not apply to sales or purchases for coins.\n\nWhy do we say गुणस्य 'of a portion'? Observe द्वौ व्रीहियवौ निमानमस्योदश्वितः ॥ Here being no comparison of ratios, there is no affixing.\n\nWhy do we say निमाने \"in denoting the thing given in exchange\"? Observe, द्वौ गुणौ क्षीरस्य एकस्तैलस्य = द्विगुणं पच्यते तैलं क्षीरेण \"one part of oil cooks or absorbs as much as two parts of milk\". Here the sense is that of 'cooking' and not of purchasing.\n\nIn short मयट् has the meaning of 'time or fold'. As द्विमय \"two time\", the word qualifying sometime the निमान, sometime the निमेय; e.g. द्विमयमुदश्वित् यवानां '_Udasvit_ is two-times or two-fold of _Yava_ in value', or द्विमया यवा उदश्वितः \"two-times _Yava_ are equal to one _Udasvit_\".",

Thus विंशतेः पूरणः = विंशतितमः or विंशः 'twentieth'. एकविंशतितमः or एकविंशः, त्रिविंशतितमः or त्रिविंशः, त्रिंशत्तमः or त्रिंशः, एकत्रिंशत्तमः or एकत्रिंशः ॥\n\nThere is no विंशत्यादि class given in _Ganapatha_. These are ordinary words like विंशति, त्रिंशत् &c. The words विंशति, त्रिंशत् &c of (V. 1. 59), should not be taken as the विंशत्यादि alluded to by this _sutra_. For had it been so, we could not have formed the words like एकविंशतितमः; because the rule applying to विंशति specifically mentioned, will not apply to विंशति as the end of a compound. As this maxim declares, ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति \"that which cannot possibly be anything but a _Pratipadika_, does, contrary to (1. 1. 72); not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself\". This being the case, the word विंशति &c must be taken in their popular signification, and not as particular _pratipadikas_; and hence also becomes valid the exception given in (V. 2. 58), in the case of षष्टि &c when preceded by another numeral. For the very prohibition असंख्यादेः in that rule, shows, that with the exception of षष्टि &c, the present rule applies to other संख्यादि words, as, एकविंशति &c.\n\nBohtlingk takes मट्, थट् and तमट् as separate affixes and not as augment. He says \"The commentators take तमट् here and in the following _Sutras_ as an Augment of डट् (V. 2. 48), because विंशति  &c with the affix तमट् would yield विंशतित꣡म by (III. 1. 3), whilst otherwise it would be accented as विंशतितम꣡ ॥ According to this interpretation मट् (V. 2. 49) and थट् (V. 2. 50) are Augments, though they would yield the right form as affixes also. That _Panini_ by forms मट्, थट् and मयट् so much resembling डट्, should not have meant an affix, is not probable. Moreover one does not understand well this, why he, if he intended that म, थ and तम should be taken as augments, does not, for the sake of clearness, ordain this after the stem, which could have been expressed by adding of the servile क् (i. e. मुक्, थुक् and तमुक्), as he does in the case of the augments थुक् (V. 2. 51), तिथुक् (V. 2. 52) and इथुक् (V. 2. 53). I also think this, that _Panini_, when he designated this affix तमट्, did not think of the accent.\"\n\nIn the case of मट् and थट् there will be no difference whatever whether we take them as affixes or as augments. Thus पंचन् + मट् = पंच् + मट् (VI. 4. 144) = पंचम ॥",
    "52057": "The words शतादय are numerals. The words मास &c, are not numerals; they would not have taken डट्, but by the implication of this _sutra_. Thus शतस्य पूरणः = शततमः 'hundreth'; सहस्रतमः, लक्षतमः ॥ Similarly मासस्य पूरणः = मासतमो दिवसः 'the last day of the month'. अर्द्धमासतमः, संवत्सरतमः ॥\n\nBy the next _Sutra_ (V. 2. 58), the words शत &c, would also have taken तमट्; but the scope of that _sutra_ is confined to numerals not preceded by another numeral. There is no such restriction here. Hence we have एकशततमः, द्विशततमः ॥",
    "52058": "By _sutra_ (V. 2. 56), the augment was optional, this makes it compulsary. Thus षष्टितमः, सप्ततितमः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not preceded by a Numeral\"? Observe, एकषष्टः एकषष्टितमः, एकसप्तमः or एकसप्ततितमः ॥ Here (V. 2. 56), applies also.",
    "52059": "The word मतौ means 'in the sense of मतुप् affix'. The sense of मतुप् is \"whose is it or in whom it is\". Thus अच्छावाक् शब्दोऽस्मिन् = अच्छावाकीयम् सूक्तम् ॥ मित्रावरुणीयम्, यज्ञायज्ञीयम् साम, वारवन्तीयम् साम ॥\n\nThe affix comes after a collocation of words, as अस्यवामीयं 'the _Sukta_ containing the words अस्य वाम' e.g. _Rig_ _Veda_ _Mandala_ l. _sukta_ 164. Here the words अस्य वामस्य are considered as a Nominal Stem. So also कयापुमीयम् ॥",
    "52060": "This _sutra_ indicates by implication (ज्ञापकः), that the affix छ comes after a nominal stem, to denote an _Adhyaya_ or an _Anuvaka_. According to _Patanjali_ the elision is optional. Thus गर्दभाण्ड शब्दोऽस्मिन्नस्ति = गर्दभाण्डोऽध्यायः, अनुवाको वा ॥ In the alternative, गर्दभाण्डीयः; so also दीर्घजीवितः or दीर्घजीवतीयः, पलितस्तम्भः or पलितस्तम्भीयः ॥",
    "52061": "Thus विमुक्तशब्दोऽस्मिन्नस्ति = वैमुक्तोऽध्यायोनुवाको वा ॥ So also दैवासुरः &c.\n\n1 विमुक्त, 2 देवासुर, 3 रक्षोऽसुर, 4 उपसद्, 5 सुवर्ण (सुपर्ण), 6 परिसारक (परिषादक् !) 7 सदसत्, 8 वसु, 9 मरुत् (मरुत्वत् ), 10 पत्नीवत्, 11 वसुमत्, 12 महीयत्व (महीयल), 13 सत्वत्, 14 बर्हवत्, 15 दशार्ण, 16 दशार्ह, 17 वयस् (दशार्हपयस्), 18 हविर्धान, 19 पतत्रिन् (पतत्रि), 20 महित्री, 21 अस्यहत्य, 22 सोमापूषन्, 23 इडा, 24 अग्नाविष्णु (विष्णू), 25 उर्वशी, 26 वृत्रहन् (वृत्रहति), 27 मित्री, 28 सोम, 29 हेतु ॥",
    "52062": "Thus गोषदशब्दोऽस्मिन्नस्ति = गोषदकोऽध्यायोऽनुवाको वा ॥ इषेत्वकः, मातरिश्वकः &c. Another reading is गोषद the final consonant being mute.\n\n1 गोषद् (गोषद), 2 इषे त्वा (त्व), 3 मातरिश्वन्, 4 देवस्य त्वा, 5 देवीरापः, 6 कृष्णोऽस्या, खरेष्ठः, 7 देवीं (दैवीं) धिय धिया (धियम्),8 रक्षोहण, 9 युञ्जान, 10 अञ्जन, 11 प्रभूत, 12 प्रतूर्त, 13 कृशानु (दृशान), 14 सहस्रशीर्षा, 15 वातस्य ते, 16 कृशाश्व, 17 स्वाहाप्राण, 18 प्रसप्त (!). ॥",
    "52063": "Thus पथि कुशलः = पथकः (पथिन् + वुन् = पथ् + वुन् (VI. 4. 144) = पथ् + अक् (VII. I. 1.).",
    "52064": "Thus आकर्षे कुशलः = आकर्षकः, त्सरुकः. Another reading has आकष (Bohtlingk).\n\n1 आकर्ष (आकष), 2, त्सरु, 3 पिशाच (पिपासा), 4 पिचण्ड, 5 अशनि, 6 अश्मन्, 7 निचय (विचय), 8 चय, 9 विजय, 10 जय, 11 आचय, 12 नय, 13 पाद (निपाद),14 दीप, 15 ह्रद, 16 ह्राद, 17 ह्लाद, 18 गद्गद, 19 शकुनि, 20 अव ॥",
    "52065": "The word काम means 'desire, wish'. Thus धने कामः = धनको देवदत्तस्य, हिरण्यको देवदत्तस्य ॥",
    "52066": "The words तत्र and कन् are understood in this _sutra_. The word प्रसित means 'devoted to, intent upon, craving after'. Thus केशेषु प्रसितः = केशकः i. e. केशादिरचनायां प्रसक्त एवमुच्यते ॥ The स्वाङ्गेभ्यः is in the plural number, indicating that the affix comes even after a collective compound of _Svanga_ terms. Thus दन्तौष्ठकः, केशनखकः ॥ See (II. 3. 44).",
    "52067": "The translation given above is according to Dr. Bohtlingk. According to the _Kasika_, the _anuvritti_ of प्रसित is also read into this _sutra_. The meaning then would be _thak_ comes after the word _udara_ in the seventh case in construction, in the sense of 'who is devoted therein', when the word so formed means \"voracious\". A person who is very much distressed by hunger is so called; उदरेऽविजिगीषुर्भण्यते ॥ Thus उदरे प्रसितः = औदरिकः (i.e. आद्यूनः).\n\nWhy do we say when it means 'voracious'? Observe उदरकः 'abdominal'.",
    "52068": "The _anuvritti_ of कन्, not of ठक् is to be read here. The word सस्य here means 'good quality', and not 'corn'. Another reading is शस्य. The word परि means 'all, every where'. That which is full of (परिजात) good qualities (सस्य) in which there is no defect, that is the signification here. Thus सस्येन परिजातः = सस्यकः शालिः 'a rice, above all praise', सस्यकः साधुः 'a good man, not equalled by any'. सस्यको मणिः 'a precious stone of the best quality', i.e. 'perfect in form'.",
    "52069": "The word अंश is used in the accusative in the aphorism, showing that the construction must be accusative. The word हारिन् nom. हारी is formed by adding णिनि to the root हृ, the force of the affix being that of \"must, or necessity\". See (III. 3. 170). The word हारिन् will govern accusative and not genitive (II. 3. 70).\n\nThus अंश हारी = अंशकः 'an heir', i. e. who is entitled to take a share at partition i.e. a दायादः । अंशकः पुत्रः ॥",
    "52070": "The word तन्त्र must be in the fifth case in construction, by the very fact of its being so employed in the _sutra_. The word अचिर means 'short time, not long' अपहृत means \"taken off\". Thus तन्त्रादचिरापहृतः = तन्त्रकः 'a cloth just taken off the loom' i. e. an unbleached cloth. As तन्त्रकः पटः, तन्त्रकः प्रावारः 'a new mantle' = प्रत्ययः or नवः ॥",
    "52071": "Thus ब्राह्मणको देशः, उष्णिका यवागूः ॥ The affix कन् is added to ब्राह्मण, with the force of 'a place where _Brahmanas_ who live by profession of arms dwell'. Similarly उष्णिक means अल्पान्नाः ॥",
    "52072": "The word शीत and उष्ण being used as adverbs will be in accusative construction. As शीतं करोति 'who goes to work coldly' i.e. a lazy man = शीतकः = अलसः, जडः. Similarly उष्णकः = शीघ्रकारी, दक्षः 'who goes to work hotly'.",
    "52073": "The word अधिकः meaning 'more', is formed by adding कन् to the word अध्यारूढ; there being elision of the second term before the affix. Thus अधिको द्रोणः खार्याम् \"a _Drona_ is superior to _Khari_\" अधिका खारी द्रोणेन \"a _Khari_ is inferior to _Drona_\". The word अध्यारूढ governs nominative or accusative indifferently.",
    "52074": "Thus अनुकामयते = अनुकः 'desirous, libidinous'. अभिकामयते = अभिकः or अभीकः 'a lover, voluptuous person'.",
    "52075": "The word पार्श्वम् means 'a fraudulent or crooked expedient'. One who endeavours to obtain any thing by fraud is called पार्श्वकः 'a cheat, a juggler, a partisan'. पार्श्व = a rib, a crooked thing; as पार्श्वकः = मायाविन्, कौसृतिकः, जालिकः &c.",
    "52076": "The word अन्विच्छति is understood here also. The word अयःशूलम् means 'a violent proceeding'. Who seeks to obtain any thing by violent means is called आयः शूलिकः = साहसिकः ॥ The word दण्डाजिन means 'staff (_danda_) and hide (_ajina_)' i.e. outer badges of devotion or hypocrisy. Who seeks to gain something by hypocrisy and deceit is called दाण्डाजिनिकः = दाम्भिकः ॥",
    "52077": "The word तावतिथं (V. 2. 53) stands here as a type of all words ending in affixes denoting i.e. ordinals. The word ग्रहण means 'acquired or Iearned hereby'. This qualifies the base. Thus द्वितीयेन रूपेण ग्रन्थं गृह्णाति = द्विकं ग्रहणम् or द्वितीयकं ग्रहणम् 'the acquisition of the knowledge or book by the second time' i.e, \"successful mastery by the second time\". So also त्रिकं or त्रितीयकम्, चतुष्कम् or चतुर्थकम् ॥\n\nVart:- When the word, formed by the affix _kan_, means the person who acquires after so many times then the elision of the पूरण affix is compulsory and not optional. Thus षष्ठेन रूपेण ग्रन्थं गृह्णाति = षट्को देवदत्तः '_Devadatta_ who learns the book for the sixth time' i.e. 'who succeeds in learning the book at the sixth attempt'. Similarly पंचकः, चतुष्कः ॥ The word ग्रहण here is confined to books only and to nothing else.",
    "52078": "The word ग्रामणी means 'head-man, leader, spokes-man'. Thus देवदत्तो ग्रामणीरेषां = देवदत्तकाः, यज्ञदत्तकाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning a leader'? Witness देवदत्तः शत्रुरेषाम् ॥ Here there is no affixing.",
    "52079": "Thus शृंखलं बन्धनमस्य करभस्य = शृंखलकः ॥  The young ones of camel are called करभ ॥ The wooden clogs put on their feet to prevent them from straying are called शृंखल ॥ Though the ropes &c are also used along with the clog, yet _srinkhala_ being the principal object that takes away the freedom is called बन्धन or bond or fetter.",
    "52080": "He whose mind anxiously desires or yearns after a thing is called उन्मनः ॥ The word उत्कः is formed by adding कन् to the preposition उद्. Thus उत्को देवदत्तः, उत्कः प्रवासी = उत्सुकः or उत्कण्ठितः ॥",
    "52081": "The word काल means 'days' &c, and प्रयोजन means 'the cause (of disease) or its effect'. Thus द्वितीयेऽह्निभवः = द्वितीयको ज्वरः 'the fever which comes on the second day'. चतुर्थकः 'a fever which comes on the fourth day'. Similarly after a word denoting प्रयोजनः, as, विषपुष्पैर्जनितः = विषपुष्पको ज्वरः 'a fever caused by poisonous flowers'. So also काषपुष्पकः ॥ So also उष्णं कार्यमस्य = उष्णकः 'a fever producing heat', शीतको ज्वरः ॥\n\nWhen 'illness' is not meant, then there is no affixing, as, द्वितीयो दिवसोऽस्य ॥ The word संज्ञा is to be read into this _sutra_ from the next _sutra_. Therefore words द्वितीयकः &c are Names.",
    "52082": "Thus गुडापूपाः प्रायेणान्नमस्या पौर्णमास्यां = गुडापूपिका पौर्णमासी \"The _Gudapupika_ - _Paurnmasi_\" i. e that particular Full- Moon day in which cakes of sugar form the principal accompaniment of food. Similarly तिलापूपिका, कृशरिका, त्रिपुटिका &c.\n\nVart:- The affix इनि comes after वटक in the same sense. As वटकिनी पौर्णमासी ॥",
    "52083": "The ञ् of अञ् is for the sake of causing _Vriddhi_ and accent. Thus कुल्माषाः प्रायेणान्नमस्यां = कौल्माषी पौर्णमासी ॥",
    "52084": "The न् in श्रोत्रियन् is for the sake of accent. As श्रो꣡त्रियो ब्राह्मणः \"a _Brahmana_ learned in the Vedas\". The word श्रोत्रिय is either a condensed expression for the full sentence छन्दोऽधीते, referring to no particular base or affix. Or the word छन्दस् is replaced by श्रोत्र, and then is added the affix घन् ॥ But how do you form then छान्दसः, in the sense of छन्दोऽधीते, by adding the affix or अण् by (IV. 2. 59) ? The present _sutra_ is optional, the word वा of (V. 2. 77) being understood here: so that we have the form श्रोत्रियः also. Some say that श्रोत्रिय applies only to that person who has not only studied the Vedas but who acts upon its purport also, while छान्दस applies to a student in general, so one _sutra_ does not debar the other, as they apply to different objects.",
    "52085": "Thus श्राद्धं भुक्तमनेन = श्राद्धी or श्राद्धिकः \"a person who has eaten obsequial food\". This relates to a person who eats on the day the _Sraddha_ ceremony takes place; and not at any other time nor who eats stale food of _sraddha_. अद्य भुक्ते श्राद्धे श्वः श्राद्धिक इति माभूत् ॥ The word श्राद्ध originally means a certain ceremony, and is derived from the word श्रद्धा with the affix ञ (V. 2. 101). In a figurative sense, it here means the food taken at that ceremony.",
    "52086": "The word अनेन of the last _sutra_ is understood here. But what is the verb of which अनेन is the agent. The भुक्त does not come to be read into this _sutra_. Therefore we must supply some general verb such as 'doing' &c, to complete the sense. Thus पूर्वं गतमनेन = पूर्वी ॥ So also पूर्वं भुक्तं, पीतं &c. अनेन = पूर्वी s. पूर्विणौ d. पूर्विणः pl. In fact पूर्विन् means by whom some thing was done &c, formerly.",
    "52087": "Thus कृतपूर्वी कटम् = पूर्वं कृतमनेन 'who formerly made'. भुक्तपूर्वी ओदनम् ॥\n\nIn these words, first कृत and पूर्व are compounded by (II. 1. 4); and then the affix is added. These two _sutras_ (V. 2. 86), (V. 2. 87), give rise to these two maxims ग्रहनवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति \"that which cannot possibly be anything but a _Pratipadika_ or Nominal-stem, does, (contrary to (l. 1.72)) not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself.\" व्यपदेशिवद्भावोऽप्रातिपदिकेन \"The rule of _vyapadesivad_-_bhava_ does not apply to a _pratipadika_\". That rule is embodied in the following _paribhasha_- व्यपदेशिवदेकस्मिन् -- \"an operation which affects some thing on account of some special designation, which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach\".",
    "52088": "Thus इष्टमनेन = इष्टी यज्ञे; पूर्त्तीश्राद्धे &c. \"who wished\", \"who performed a charitable act\". The words इष्टिन्, पूर्त्तिन् &c. formed by इन् will govern locative instead of accusative. See _vartika_ under (II. 3. 36).\n\n1 इष्ट 2 पूर्त, 3 उपासादित (उपसादित), 4 निगदित, 5 परिगदित, 6 परिवादित, 7 निकथित, 8 निपादित, 9 निपठित, 10 संकलित, 11 परिकलित, 12 संरक्षित, 13 परिरक्षित, 14 अर्चित, 15 गणित, 16 अवकीर्ण, 17 आयुक्त, 18 गृहीत, 19 आम्नात, 20 श्रुत (आम्नातश्रुत), 21 अधीत, 22 अवधान (!), 23 आसेवित, 24 अवधारित, 25 अवकल्पित, 26 निराकृत, 27 उपकृत, 28 उपाकृत, 29 अनुयुक्त, 30 अनुगणित, 31 अनुपठित, 32 व्याकुलित, 33 परिकथित, 34 संकल्पित, 35 विकलित 36 निपतित, 37 पठित, 38 पूजित, 39 परिगणित, 40 उपगणित, 41 परित (!) 42 अपवारित, 43 उपनत, 44 निगृहीत, 45 अपचित. ॥",
    "52089": "The word पर्यवस्थातृ means 'an adversary, an antagonist'. Thus मा त्वा॑ परिप॒॒रिणो॑ विद॒॒न् मा त्वा॑ परिपं॒॒थिनो विद॒॒न् (_Yaj_. _Ved_. IV. 34). These words are obsolete in secular literature. See however _Gita_ III. 34.",

    "52091": "The word साक्षात् is an Indeclinable. The word संज्ञा is used in the aphorism to restrict the sense of the word. Thus साक्षाद् द्रष्टा = साक्षी, d. साक्षिणौ, pl. साक्षिणः 'an eye-witness'. In any transaction like loan, &c, three persons directly see the fact, and may be called द्रष्टा, viz. who gives, who takes, and another who merely looks on. By using the word संज्ञा, the word साक्षिन् is restricted to the mere looker on, and not to the lender or borrower.",
    "52092": "The whole word enunciated here in the sense of _para_-_kshetre_ _chikitsya_; or the word क्षेत्रिय, with acute on the last syllable, is formed by adding the affix घच् to the word परक्षेत्र, the force of the affix being 'curable therein' and the word पर is elided before this affix. Thus क्षेत्रियो व्याधिः 'incurable disease'. क्षेत्रियं कुष्ठं 'incurable Ieprosy': i.e. --organic disease. The word परक्षेत्र means body assumed in the next reincarnation. The word क्षेत्रिय applies to an irremediable disease.\n\nThe word क्षेत्रियं means 'poison' also = यत् परछेत्रे परशरीरेसंक्रमय्य चिकित्स्यते ॥ 'that which is to be removed from another's body where it has entered'. Or क्षेत्रिय means 'rank growth or grass', i.e. यानि सस्यार्थे क्षेत्रे जातानि चिकित्स्यानि नाशयितव्यानि ॥ \"that like grass &c, which grows in a _para_-_kshetra_ or another's field i. e. a field set apart for grain &c, and not for grass, and which therefore must be weeded out (_chikitsya_)\" Or क्षेत्रिय is an 'adulterer', i.e. परदाराः परक्षेत्रं, तत्र चिकित्स्यः निगृहीतव्यः ॥ These are all secondary meanings.",
    "52093": "The word इंद्रिय is a primitive word, meaning organs of sense, such as eyes &c. Its derivation is obscure, if it is a derivative word at all. In the latter alternative, it may be said to be formed by the affix घच् added after इन्द्र, in the sense of either 'a mark thereof'. As इन्द्रस्य लिङ्गम् = इन्द्रियम् ॥ The senses (_indriyas_) are so called because, _Indra_ is _Atma_ or soul, and it is inferred by the existence of the senses, eyes, ears &c. So that these organs are the 'marks or signs or _linga_ of _Indra_ : because they being an instrument presupose an agent, there being no instrument without an agent.\n\nOr the senses (_indriyas_) are so-called because they are 'seen or known by _Indra_ or _Atma_' (इन्द्रेण दृष्टं = ज्ञातं). The affix is here added to a word in the third case in construction. The knowing or perceiving of the senses by the Self is an allusion to the following _Sruti_ of the _Aitareya_ _Upanishad_ Chapter 111. verse 13, where the Self having created the physical body took a survey of it. स एतमेव पुरुषं ब्रह्म ततमम पश्यदिदमदर्शमिती \"He beheld this _Brahma_ who dwells in the body who pervades everywhere, and exclaimed -- 'I have seen this'. Or they are so called because they are created by _Indra_ or _Atma_ (इन्द्रेण सृष्टं) i. e. the senses are formed according to the good and bad deeds of the Self. Or they are so called because they are wished for by _Indra_ or Self (इन्द्रेण जुष्टं सेवितं) as they are the gate-ways of knowledge. Or they are so called because they are given by _Indra_ (इन्द्रेण दत्तं) i. e. they are allotted to their respective objects by _Indra_ e. g. the eye is given to perceive forms, the ear to perceive sounds and so on. The word वा 'or' joins every one of the above. The word इति shows, that there may be other appropriate significations also: As, इन्द्रेण दुर्जयम् = इन्द्रियम् 'senses' -- difficult to be subdued by the Soul.",
    "52094": "Thus गावोऽस्य सन्ति = गोमत् nom. गोमान् 'having cows', as गोमान् देवदत्तः ॥ वृक्षा अस्मिन् सन्ति = वृक्षवत् (व being substituted for म by (VIII. 2. 9)), as वृक्षवान् पर्वतः ॥ Similarly यवमान्, प्लक्षमान् ॥ The word इति shows that the use of मतुप् and cognate affixes are restricted in their application. For example, a person who has three barley grains only will not be called यववान् ॥ This affix comes when the significations are (1) A large quantity or number, as गोमान् 'having many cows'. (2) When censure (निन्दा) is implied, as ककुदावर्त्ती, संखादकी (3) when praise (प्रशंसा) is meant, as रूपवती कन्या, (4) when an inherent or permanent quality of a thing is meant (नित्ययोग) as, क्षीरिणी वृक्षः ॥ (5) When excellence (अतिशायन) is meant, as, उदरिणी कन्या ॥ (6) When accompaniment (संसर्ग) is meant, as दण्डी, छत्री ॥ (7) When the sense of अस्ति 'to be' is denoted, as अस्तिमान् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix मतुप् is elided after words of quality (गुणवचन), as शुक्लो गुणोऽस्यास्ति = शुक्लः पटः ॥ कृष्णः, श्वेतः &c.",

According to _Patanjali_ this _sutra_ is useless. Or the word रस &c, must denote qualities, perceivable by the organs of taste, touch &c, i. e. रस should mean taste, रूप form. Therefore the forms रूपिणी and रूपिकः are valid, meaning शोभायोग्यता ॥ So also रसिको तटः = भावयोगः, here रूप and रस do not mean 'form' and 'taste'.

Observe हस्तवान्, पादवान् ॥\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the affix लच् comes only after what denotes member or limb of a living being, (and not anything like love, passion, intelligence &c, that are also found in living being). Hence there is no affixing of लच् here : चिकीर्षाऽस्यास्ति = चिकीर्षावान्, जिहीर्षावान् ॥\n\nEvery affix is _udatta_ (III. 1. 3), unless contrary is indicated by some _anubandha_. The लच् would have been udatta by (III. 1. 3), even without the indicatory च् (V1. 1. 163). The employment of this _anubandha_, however indicates that this _udatta_ will never be changed into _svarita_, as other _udattas_ are by rule (VIII. 2. 6), as चूडालोऽसि ॥",
    "52097": "Thus सिध्मलः or सिध्मवान्, गडुलः or गडुवान् ॥ The word अन्यतरस्याम् understood in this _sutra_, causes the employment of the affix मतुप् in the alternative. It does not mean that the affix लच् is optional. For were लच् optional, then the affix इनि and ठन् would come by (V. 2. 115) after those words of सिध्मादि class which end in अ. But that is not the case.\n\nVart:- The words पार्ष्णि and धमनि lengthen the vowel before ल, as पार्ष्णीलः, धमनीलः ॥\n\nVart:- The words वात, दन्त, बल, ललाट and गल take the augment ऊङ् before लच्, as वातूलः, दन्तूलः, बलूलः, ललाटूलः, गलूलः ॥\n\nVart:- The word जटा, घटा, कटा and कला take लच्, when censure is meant, as जटालः, घटालः, कलालः and कटालः, but जटावांस्तापसः when no censure is meant.\n\nVart:- This affix comes after words denoting lower organisms, and word denoting disease: as यूकालः मक्षिकालः, विचर्चिकालः, विपादिकालः, मूर्छालः ॥\n\n1 सिध्म, 2 गडु, 3 मणि, 4 नाभि, 5 बीज (जीव), 6 वीणा, 7 कृष्ण, 8 निष्पाव, 9 पांसु, 10 पार्श्व, 11 पर्शू (परशु), 12 हनु, 13 सक्तु, 14 मांस, 15 पार्ष्णिधमन्यो दीर्घश्च 16 वातदन्तबललाटानामूङ् च 17 जटाघटाकटाकलाः (कटा) क्षेपे, 18 पर्ण, 19 उदक, 20 प्रज्ञा, 21 सष्कि, (सक्थि) 22 कर्ण, 23 स्नेह, 24 शीत, 25 श्याम, 26 पिङ्ग, 27 पित्त, 28 पुष्क (शुष्क), 29 पृथु, 30 मृदु, 31 मञ्जु, 32 मण्ड, 33 पत्र, 34 चटु, 35 कपि, 36 गण्डु (कण्डु), 37 ग्रन्थि, 38 श्री, 39 कुश, 40 धारा, 41 वर्ष्मन्, 42 पक्ष्मन्, 43 श्लेष्मन्, 44 पेश, 45 निष्पाद्, 46 कुण्ड, 47 क्षुद्रजन्तूपतापयोश्च 48 गण्ड, 49 संज्ञा ॥",
    "52098": "Thus वत्सलः 'loving the calf, loving, tender'. अंसलः 'strong, lusty'. The word वत्स means 'calf'; in वत्सल there is no trace of its origin, for it is applied to father, master &c, as वत्सलः स्वामी, वत्सलः पिता &c. The word अंस means 'shoulder': but अंसल means 'strong'. The affix लच् in these cases is not optional, but necessary and debars मतुप् ॥ In other senses, the _matup_ only is added as अंसवती गौः, अंसवान् दुर्बलः ॥",
    "52099": "The word च् draws in लच्; and the word अन्यतरस्याम् understood in the _sutra_ adds मतुप् in the alternative. As फेनिलः, फेनलः and फेनवान् ॥",
    "52100": "The affix श comes after लोमादि words as, लोमशः or लोमवान् 'hairy'. The affix न comes after पामादि words, as, पामनः or पामवान् 'scabby'. The affix इलच् comes after पिच्छादि words, as, पिच्छिलः or पिच्छिवान् 'broth'.\n\nVart:- The affix न comes after the word अङ्ग in the sense of beautiful; as अङ्गना 'the fair one' i.e. a woman.\n\nVart:- The words शाकी, पलाली and दद्रू shorten their final vowel before न, as शाकिनम् 'a field', पलालिनम्, दद्रुणम् ॥\n\nVart:- The word विष्वक् (विषु + अंच्) loses its second member, before न, and the change caused by _sandhi_ (उ in to व्) is undone. Otherwise the form would be विष्णः (वक् being elided), as विष्वञ्जितानि सन्ति अस्य = विषुणम् 'moving variously'.\n\nVart:- The affix न comes after लक्ष्मी, before which ई is changed to अ, as लक्ष्मीरस्यास्ति = लक्ष्मणः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix _ilach_ comes after _jata_, _ghata_, and _kala_, when censure is meant, as जटिलः, घटिलः कलिलः but जटावान् when no censure is meant.\n\n1 लोमन्, 2 रोमन्, 3 बभ्रु, 4 हरि, 5 गिरि, 6 कर्क, 7 कपि, 8 मुनि, 9 तरु ॥\n\n1 पामन्, 2 वामन्, 3 वेमन्, 4 हेमन्, 5 श्लेष्मन्, 6 कद्र (कद्रु), 7 वाल, 8 सामन्, 9 ऊष्मन्, 10 कृमि, 11 अङ्गात् कल्याण, 12 शाकीपलालीदद्रूणां (शाकीपलालीद्द्रूवां), हृस्वत्वं च, 13 विष्वगित्युत्तरपदलोपश्चाकृतसंधेः (विषुण), 14 लक्ष्म्या अच्च (लक्ष्मणः), 15 श्रेष्ठ, 16 पलल ॥\n\n1 पिच्छा (पिच्छ), 2 उरस, 3 घुवक (क्षुवक), 4 ध्रुवक (ध्रुवका), 5 जटाघटाकलः (जटाघटाकलान्), क्षेपे, 6 वर्ण, 7 उदक, 8 पङ्क, 9 प्रज्ञा ॥",

    "52102": "The word तपस् ends in अस्, and therefore by (V. 2. 121), it would have taken विनि; similarly सहस्र ends in अ, and by (V. 2. 115), it would have taken इनि; it may, therefore, be objected, where is the necessity for the present _sutra_? To this it is replied, that by the next _sutra_, these words take the affix अण् also; so that, had there not been this present _sutra_, the अण् would have debarred the application of इनि and विनि of (V. 2. 115) and (V. 2. 121). The affix ठन् (V. 1.115) is also debarred after the word सहस्र, though it ends in अ ॥\n\nThus तपोऽस्यास्मिन् वा विद्यते = तपस्विन् nom. तपस्वी ॥ Similarly सहस्रिन् nom. सहस्रा ॥",
    "52103": "Thus तापसः, साहस्रः ॥ The separation of this _sutra_ from the last is for two purposes, Ist the _anuvritti_ of अण् runs in the subsequent _sutras_, which could not have been done had it been included in the last _sutra_, 2nd the rule of _yathasankhya_ (1. 3. 10) would not have applied in the last _sutra_, had अण् been read along with विनि and इनि ॥\n\nVart:- The words ज्योत्स्ना &c, are governed by this rule and take अण्. As ज्योत्स्ना विद्यतेऽस्मिन् पक्षे = ज्यौत्स्नः पक्षः ॥ Similarly तामिस्रः (a kind of hell) कौण्डलः, कौतपः, वैसर्पः, and वैपादिकः ॥",
    "52104": "Thus सैकटो घटः, शार्करं मधु ॥ These are the examples, when they do not denote a place. In denoting a place they will take इल् and लुप् of the next _sutra_.",
    "52105": "By च in the _sutra_, अण् and मतुप् are introduced. The लुप् refers to मतुप् and every affix in general. Thus सिकता अस्मिन् विद्यन्ते = सिकता देशः or सिकतिलः, सकतः or सिकतावान् 'a sandy country'. So also शर्करा देशः or शर्करिलः or शार्करः or शर्करावान् 'a stony locality'.\n\nWhy do we say when meaning a 'locality'? Observe सैकतः 'a vessel of sand', शार्कां \"honey or sugar\". In the case of the elision of the affix, the gender and number are preserved by (1. 2. 51).",
    "52106": "Thus दन्ता उन्नता अस्य सन्ति = दन्तुरः ॥ The words in the _sutra_ are either in the nominative or the locative case, but have the force of ablative.\n\nWhy do we say when the meaning is that of 'projecting'? Observe दन्तवान् 'having teeth'.",
    "52107": "Thus ऊषरं क्षेत्रम् 'a barren soil, impregnated with _usha_ or salt'. सुषिरं काष्ठं 'a perforated wood i. e. containing सुषि or hole'. मुष्करः वशुः 'a beast having testicles or _mushka_'. मधुरो गुडः 'sweet sugar'. The word इति shows that the words formed with र are names of certain things. Therefore it will not apply here ऊषोऽस्मिन् घटे विद्यते 'there is salt in this pot', we cannot say ऊषरो घटः, nor मधुरो घटः for मध्वस्मिन् घटे विद्यते ॥\n\nVart:- The affix र comes after ख, मुख and कुञ्ज, as खमस्यास्ति कण्डविवरं महत् = खरः 'an ass, lit. having a wide throat'. मुखमस्यास्ति इति सर्वस्मिन् वक्तव्ये = मुखरः 'talkative', कुञ्जावस्य स्तः = कुञ्जरः 'an elephant having tusks'. The word कुञ्ज means the tusk of an elephant or the lower jaw of an elephant. The word कुञ्जर is a common name for all elephants.\n\nVart:- The affix र comes after नग, पांसु and पाण्डु, as नगरम् 'a city, lit. having trees (_naga_ = tree)', पांसुरम्, पाण्डुरम् ॥\n\nVart:- So also after कच्छू, the vowel being shortened: as कच्छुरम् ॥",
    "52108": "Thus द्युमः and द्रुमः ॥ These are primitive words, and therefore do not take मतुप् in the alternative.",
    "52109": "Though the word अन्यतरस्याम् was understood here from (V. 2. 96) (see _sutra_ (V. 2. 97); its repetition shows that in the alternative we have not only मतुप् but the affixes इनि and ठन् (V. 2. 115) also. Thus we have four forms: केशवः, केशी, केशिकः and केशवान् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix व is seen after other words also. As मणिवः 'a kind of serpent', हिरण्यवः 'a kind of gem', कररावः, कुमारवः, राजीवम्, कुञ्जावः, इष्टकावः ॥\n\nVart:- The final of अर्णस् is elided before व, as अर्णवः ॥\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_, the affixes ई, वनिप्, व and मतुप् come in the sense of मतुप् ॥ Thus ईः- रथीरभून् मुद्गलानी गविष्टौ (रथीः), सुमङ्गलीरियं वधूः; वनिप् :- मघवानमीमहे; व and मतुप्, as उद्वा or उद्वती ॥\n\nVart:- The affixes इरन् and इरच् come respectively after मेधा and रथः as, मे꣡धिरः, रथिरः ॥",
    "52110": "As गाण्डीवं 'the bow _Gandiva_ of _Arjuna_'  अजगवं 'the bow _Ajagava_ of _Siva_'. There is shortening also, as गाण्डिवं ॥ The _sutra_ is so framed, that the word गाण्डी and गाण्डि are both included.",
    "52111": "Thus का꣡ण्डीरः and अण्डीरः꣡ ॥ Another reading has आण्ड and आण्डीरः ॥",
    "52112": "As रजस्वला स्त्री, कृषीवलः कुटुम्बी, आसुतीवलः शौण्डिकः, परिषद्वलो राजा ॥ The lengthening of vowel in कृषि and आसुति takes place by (VI. 3. 118). The affix वलच् comes only under certain senses and conditions, as shown in the above examples. Thus in रजोऽस्मिन् ग्रामे विद्यते, there is no affixing.\n\nVart:- The affix _valach_ is seen after other words also. As भ्रातृवलः, पुत्रवलः, पितृवलः, उत्साहवलः ॥",
    "52113": "Thus दन्तावलः सैन्यः, दन्तावलो गजः, शिखावलं नगरम्, शिखावलो स्थूणा ॥ The final vowel of दन्त is lengthened before वल by (VI. 3. 118).",
    "52114": "They are thus formed. ज्योतिष् + न = ज्योत्स्ना 'moon-light' (the इ being elided). तमस् + र = तमिस्रा 'night'. (इ being added ): it has other genders than feminine as तमिस्रं नभः 'dark sky'. शृङ्ग + इमच् = शृङ्गिणः ॥ The augment असुक् is added to ऊर्ज्, and then the affix विनि and वलच्; as ऊर्ज् + अस् + विन् = ऊर्ज्स्विन्; ऊर्ज्स्वलः ॥ गो + मिनि = गोमिन्; मल + इनच् = मलिनः; मल + ईमसच् = मलीमसः ॥",
    "52115": "Thus दण्डिन्, दण्डिकः, छत्रिन् nom. छत्री, छत्रिकः ॥ The word अन्यतरस्याम् (V. 2. 96) is understood here also, so we have मतुप्, as दण्डवान्, छत्रवान् ॥ Why do we say 'short अ'? Observe खट्वावान्. Here there is neither इन् nor ठन् ॥\n\nThese two affixes इनि and ठन् do not come after words of one syllable, after words ending in _krit_-affixes, after words denoting genus (_jati_), and when the construction is that of locative. As स्व and ख form only स्वावान्, खवान् ॥ _Krit_: as, कारकवान् ॥ Genus, as, व्याघ्रवान्, सिंहवान् ॥ Locative; as दण्डा अस्यां सन्ति = दण्डवती शाला ॥ There are, however, some exceptions to this, as _krit_ :-- कार्यिन्, कार्यिकः हार्यिन्, हार्यिकः ॥ Genus (_jati_) :-- तण्डुलिन्, तण्डुलिकः ॥",
    "52116": "Thus व्रीहिन् (nom. व्रीही), व्रीहिकः, व्रीहिमान्, मायी, मायिकः, मायावान् ॥\n\nThese two affixes, however, do not come after all व्रीह्यादि words. According to _Patanjali_, the affix इनि comes after शिखादि sub-division, and the affix इकन् after यवखदादि sub-division, after the remaining words, both इनि and ठन् (= इकन्) come. The शिखादि after which इनि only comes are:- 1 शिखा, 2 मेखला, 3 संज्ञा, 4 बलाका, 5 माला, 6 वीणा, 7 वडवा, 8 अष्टका, 9 पताका, 10 कर्मन्, 11 चर्मन्, 12 हंसा, ॥ The यवखद &c. are the following 1 यवखद, 2 कुमारी, 3 मौ; they take इकन् only. The rest take both. The word व्रीहि will get these affixes by the next _sutra_ also, why is it then read in this class? The word व्रीहि in the _Tundadi_ class (V. 2. 117), does not mean the word-form व्रीहि, but words synonym with it. Thus शालयोऽस्य सन्ति = शालिलः, शाली, शालिकः, शालिमान् ॥ The word शीर्ष preceded by the negative particle, takes these affixes, as आशीर्षी and अशीर्षिकः ॥ The remaining words are व्रीहि, माया, शाला, केका, वर्मन्, दंष्ट्रा, संज्ञा ॥",
    "52117": "The force of च is that इनि, ठन् and मतुप् also come. As तुन्दिलः, तुन्दी, तुन्दिकः, तुन्दवान्. Similarly उदरिलः, उदरी, उदरिकः, उदरवान् ॥\n\nThe following is the list of तुन्दादि words 1 तुन्द, 2 उदर, 3 पिचण्ड, 4 घट, 5 यव, 6 व्रीहि, 7 स्वाङ्गाद्विवृद्धौ च ॥ That is to say, the affix इलच् comes after words denoting parts of one's body, when the largeness (विवृद्धि) of those organs is implied : as विवृद्धौ कर्णौ यस्य स = कार्णलः, कर्णी, कर्णिकः, कर्णवान् ॥",
    "52118": "Thus एकशतमस्यास्ति = ऐकशतिकः; गौशतिकः, गौसहस्रिकः ॥\n\nThe word अतः of (V. 2. 115), is understood here also; so that, stems not ending in अ are not governed by this rule, such as एकविंशतिरस्यास्ति, no affixing. The word ऐकगविकः is an apparent exception, it being formed by adding ठञ् to the _samasanta_ word एकगव (V. 4. 92). How do you explain गौशकटिकः formed by ठञ् from गोशकटी ? Here शकटं is taken for शकटी, both being synonyms (N. B. This opinion of the _Kasika_-author is not in harmony with that of _Patanjali_, who does not read the _anuvritti_ of अतः into this _sutra_. According to him गौशकटिक is formed from गोशकटी; and एकविंशति &c, do not take this affix, because it is against usage. But the author of _Kasika_ says—अवश्यं चात इत्यनुवर्त्यम्; द्वन्द्वापतोपगर्ह्यात् इत्येवमाद्यर्थम् -- the _anuvritti_ of अतः must surely be read, for the sake of _sutras_ like (V. 2. 128), though in the _sutras_, like वातातिसाराभ्यां &c there is no necessity of reading the _anuvritti_ of अतः) ॥\n\nThe word नित्यम् 'always', is used in the _sutra_ to indicate that मतुप् does not come in the alternative. In all the previous _sutras_ मतुप् came in the alternative. How do you form एकद्रव्यवत् in एकद्रव्यवत्वाद् ? This is not a correct form; or it may be said to be a compound of एक and द्रव्यवत्वात् ॥",
    "52119": "Thus निष्कशतमस्यास्ति = नैष्कशतिकः, नैष्कसहस्रिकः ॥ But not so after सुवर्णनिष्कशतं, it being never so found in usage.",
    "52120": "Thus आहतं रूपमस्य = रूप्यो दीनारः 'a _Dinara_ having stamped on it the form of some king &c'. रूप्यः केदारः, रूप्यं कार्षापणम्. Similarly प्रशस्तं रूपमस्यास्ति = रूप्यः पुरुषः 'a lovely person'. The form impressed on a _dinar_ &c by hammering &c, is called आहत or stamping.\n\nWhy do we say 'when stamping or praise is denoted ?' Observe रूपवान् 'having form'.\n\nVart:- The affix यप् is seen after other words also, as हिम्याः पर्वताः, गुण्या ब्राह्मणाः ॥",
    "52121": "Thus पयस्-पयस्विन्, यशस्-यशस्विन् ॥ मायाविन्, मेधाविन्, स्रग्विन् ॥ The word माया being included in व्रीह्यादि class, will take इनि, and ठञ् also (V. 2. 116). As मायी, मायिकः ॥",
    "52122": "As अग्ने तेजस्विन् ॥ Sometimes it is not added, as सूर्यो वर्चस्वान् ॥\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_, the finals अ of इय, उभय and हृदय is lengthened optionally before विनि; and it comes after अष्ट्रा, मेखला and रुजा also : as अष्ट्रावी, मेखलावी, इयावी, उभयावी, रुजावी, हृदयावी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after मर्म, as मर्मावी ॥\n\nVart:- Always after आमय, in the sacred as well as secular literature. As आमयावी ॥\nVart:- The affix आरकन् comes after शृङ्ग and वृन्द; as शृ꣡ङ्गारकः, वृ꣡न्दारकः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इनच् comes after फल and बर्ह, as फलिनः꣡ and बर्हिणः꣡ ॥\n\nVart:- So also after हृदय; the affix चालु comes optionally: as, हृदयालुः, हृदयी, हृदयिकः, हृदयवान् ॥ The च् is इत् by (I. 3.7).\n\nVart:- The affix आलुच् comes after शीत, उष्ण, and तृप, in the sense of not being able to bear that. As शीतं न सहते = शीतालुः 'shivering from cold'. उष्णालुः, तृपालुः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after हिम comes the affix एलु in the above sense: as हिमं न सहते = हिमेलुः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ऊलुच् in the same sense after बल; as बलं न सहते = बलूलः ॥\n\nVart:- So also after वात; as वातानां समूहः, or वातं न सहते = वातूलः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix तन् comes after पर्व and मरुत्. As प꣡र्वतः and म꣡रुत्तः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इनि comes after अर्थ in the sense of 'not having that' as अर्थी 'a beggar, who has not _artha_ or wealth'. Otherwise अर्थवान् 'rich'. All these are obtained by बहुलः ॥",
    "52123": "The स् of युस् makes the word ऊर्णा a पद (I. 4. 16); the result of which is that rules applicable to भ _Bha_ do not apply; e. g. (VI. I. 148), by which the final इ or ई, अ or आ is elided. Thus ऊर्णायुः ॥ According to some; छन्दसि is to be read in this _sutra_. The author of _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_ says that this is reasonable; for if _yus_ is added to _urna_ in secular literature also, then there was no necessity of this _sutra_. The word _urna_ could have been read along with _aham_ and _subham_ in (V. 2. 140).",
    "52124": "Thus वाग्मी, वाग्मिनौ, वाग्मिनः. The affix is not मिन्, for had it been so, the form would have been वाङ्मिन् by (VIII. 4. 45) _Vart_.",
    "52125": "This debars ग्मिन् ॥ Thus वाचालः 'garrulous', वाचाटः ॥\n\nVart:- These affixes come when contempt is expressed. An orator (वाग्मी) also talks much, but to the purpose. He will not be called वाचालः or वाचाटः ॥",
    "52126": "The affix आमिन् comes in the sense of lordship after the word स्व ॥ Thus स्वमस्यास्ति = ऐश्वर्यमस्यास्ति = स्वामिन् ॥ Why do we say when meaning 'Sir'. Observe, स्ववान् ॥",
    "52127": "Thus अर्शोसि अस्य विद्यन्ते = अर्शसः उरसः &c. ॥ After a word denoting a member of the body comes the affix अच्, when defect is meant. As खञ्जः पादोस्यास्ति = खञ्जः, काणः ॥ So also after words denoting color, as शुक्लोऽस्यास्ति = शुक्लः पटः ॥\n\n1 अर्शस्, 2 उरस्, 3 तुन्द, 4 चतुर, 5 पलित, 6 जटा, 7 घटा, 8 घाटा, 9 अघ (अभ्र), 10 कर्दम, 11 अम्ल (आम), 12 लवण, 13 स्वाङ्गाद्धीनात्, 14 वर्णात् आकृतिगण ॥",
    "52128": "Thus _Dvandva_:-- कटकवलयिनी 'a woman having a bracelet and a zone', शङ्खनूपुरिणी 'a woman having _sankha_ and _nupur_ ornaments'. So after diseases: कुष्ठी 'a leper', किलासी 'a white leper'. So after names of faults:- ककुदावर्ती, काकतालुकी ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when found in a living being ?' Observe पुष्पफलवान् वृक्षः ॥ The affix, according to a _Vartika_, does not come after words denoting members of a living body: as, पाणिपादवती ॥ The word अतः (V. 2. 115), is understood in this _sutra_, so that the affix does not come after words not ending in अ; as चित्रकललाटिकावती ॥ Though _Dvandva_ compounds &c. ending in अ, would have taken इनि by (V. 2. 115), the repetition of this affix in the present _sutra_ shows that _Dvandva_ compounds &c, take only इनि, and not ठन् &c.",
    "52129": "The words वात and अतिसार being names of diseases, will take इनि by the fore-going _sutra_; the present aphorism only teaches the affixing of the augment. Thus वातकी, अतिसारकी ॥ Another reading is अतीसारकी ॥\n\nVart:- So also after पिशाच, as पिशाचकी वैश्रवणः 'the _Kubera_'.\n\nThis is when the words वात and अतिसार denote diseases. Otherwise, वातवती गुहा ॥",
    "52130": "Thus पञ्चमोऽस्यास्ति मासः संवत्सरो वा = पंचमिन् 'five months or years old', as पंचमी उष्ट्रः ॥ Similarly नवमी, दशमी &c. By (V. 2. 115) the affix इनि would have come after these words; the present _sutra_ is a restrictive rule teaching that ठन् does not come in this sense.\n\nWhy do we say वयसि 'when age is denoted'? Observe, पंचमवान् ग्रामरागः ॥",
    "52131": "Thus सुखिन् nom. सुखी; दुःखिन् &c. When censure is implied, then इन् comes after माला, to the exclusion of मतुप्, as माली ॥\n\nThe following is the list of सुखादि word:-  \n\n1 सुख, 2 दुःख, 3 तृप्त, 4 कृच्छ, 5 आश्र (आम्र), 6 अस्र, 7 अलीक, 8 करुण (करुणा) 9 सोढ, 10 प्रतीप (प्रमीप), 11 शील,12 हल, 13 माला क्षेपे, 14 कृपण, 15 प्रणय (प्रणाय) 16 वल, 17 कक्ष ॥",

    "52134": "Thus वर्णिन् 'a _Brahmachari_'. The first three वर्ण or castes, who are entitled to the investiture with sacred thread, and lead the life of a _Brahma_ student are so called. When the meaning is not of _Brahmachari_ we have वर्णवान् ॥",

When denoting a Name, the forms will be कम्यः and शम्यः ॥",
    "52139": "Thus तुन्दिनः 'having a protuberent belly'. बलिभः and वटिभः ॥ Another form is बलिभः, because बलि is included in the _Pamadi_ class (V. 2. 100). The forms तुन्दिलः &c, are valid by (V. 2. 117).",

    "53001": "The affixes herein taught do not change the sense of the word, i.e. they are स्वार्ध affixes which leave to the word their own denotation. The rule (IV. 1. 82), extends no further than this, hence the words formed by these affixes do not produce epithets connoting the sense of the primitive and denoting something else.\n\nThus (V. 3. 7) declares, that after the words किम् in the ablative there is the affix तसिल्, as कुतः, ततः, यतः ॥\n\nThe purpose served by designating these affixes as _Vibhakti_ is (a) to debar the elision of final स् and म् of the affixes as इत् (1. 3. 4). Thus in the affix दानीम् (V. 3. 18), म् is not इत्, had it been so, rule (I. 1. 47) would have applied: (b) to regulate the accent of इदम्, thus इदम् + तसिल् = इतः here by (VI. I. 171), the affix तसिल् becomes _udatta_ by virtue of its being _Vibhakti_, othewise the accent would have been regulated by the indicatory ल् (VI.

The word किम् is a सर्वनाम, but it being included in the _dyadi_ class, would have been exempted from the operation of this rule had it not been separately mentioned.\n\nVart:- The word बहु here is a _Sankhya_. Therefore, the affix does not apply here, बहोः सूपात्, बहौ सूपे ॥",
    "53003": "The word प्राग्दिशः is understood here also. The श् of इश् is indicatory of the substitution of the whole (1. 1. 55). Thus इदम् + ह (V. 3. 11) = इह ॥",

Observe सर्वत्रदेशे (where although the case is the 7th, the affix is not दा, because the sense is) 'in every place' or 'every where'.",
    "53016": "The words सप्तम्याः and काले are understood. This _rhil_ debars _ha_. The ल् of र्हिल् is for accent. Thus अस्मिन् काले = एतर्हि (V. 3. 4) 'at this time'. Why 'when time is denoted'? Observe, इह 'in this place', as इह देशे ॥ See (V. 3. 4).",
    "53017": "As अस्मिन् काले = अधुना 'at this time' अश् is substituted for इदम् and, धुन affix is added.",

    "53020": "The affix दा comes after इदम् and र्हि after तद् ॥ Thus इदा (V. 3. 3), तर्हि (VII. 2. 102). So also इदानीम् and तदानीम् ॥ As इ॒॒दा हि य॒॒मुप॑स्तुतिभि॒॒दा वा॒॒मस्य॑ भ॒॒क्तये॑ (_Rig_ _Veda_ VIII. 27. 11).",

    "53022": "The words सप्तम्याः and काले are understood here. The base, the substitute, the affix, the particular time &c, must all be deduced from these forms. Thus सद्यः is formed from समान, by substituting स for समान, and adding the affix द्यस्; in the sense of 'a day'. समानेऽहनि = सद्यः 'the same day'. The पूर्व and पूर्वतर are replaced by पर, and then the affixes उत् and आरि are added, in the sense of 'a year'. Thus पूर्वस्मिन् संवत्सरे = परुत् 'last year'. पूर्वतरे संवत्सरे = परार 'the year belore last'. The इश replaces इदम्, and affix समतण् is added, in the sense of 'year'. Thus अस्मिन् संवत्सरे = ऐषमः 'during this years'. To पर is added एद्यवि in the sense of 'a day': as, परस्मिन्नहनि = परेद्यवि 'the other day'. The अद्य replaces इदम् and the affix द्यस् is added in the sense of 'a day'. Thus अस्मिन्नहनि = अद्य 'to day'. To the words पूर्व, अन्य, अन्यतर, इतर, अपर, अधर, उभय and उत्तर is added the affix एद्युस्, in the sense of 'a day': as पूर्वस्मिन्नहनि = पूर्वेद्युस् 'on the day before', अन्यस्मिन्नहनि = अन्येद्युस् 'on the following day'. अन्यतरस्मिन्नहनि = अन्यतरेद्युः 'on either of two days'. इतरस्मिन्नहनि = इतरेद्युः 'on another day', अपरस्मिन्नहनि = अपरेद्युः 'on the following day', अधरस्मिन्नहनि = अधरेद्युः 'on a previous day'. उभयोरहनोः = उभयेद्युः 'on both days'.",
    "53023": "The _sutra_ (V. 3. 2), is to be read into this. The _anuvritti_ of सप्तम्याः and काले ceases. The word प्रकार means the differentiating quality distinguishing a species among the genus : it means 'sort', 'kind', 'mode', 'manner' &c. Thus तेन प्रकारेण = तथा 'so, in that manner'. Similarly यथा, सर्वथा ॥ The affix जातीयर् taught in (V. 3. 69) has also the same force, with this difference that _jatiyar_ applies to words which denote things possessing such a quality (प्रकारयाच्च, while _thal_ denotes mode itself. Therefore, one does not debar the other, so that we have forms like, तथाजातीयः and यथाजातीयः ॥",
    "53024": "This debars थाल्; thus : अनेन प्रकारेण = इत्थम् (V. 3. 4) 'in this manner'. The उ in थमु protects the  म् from becoming इत् (See (I. 3. 4)).",
    "53025": "Thus केन प्रकारेण = कथम् 'how?'.",
    "53026": "The word प्रकार वचने is read into the _sutra_ by force of च ॥ Thus कथा 'wherefore? why? for what reason?', कथा 'how'. The former is an example of हेतु 'reason or cause', the second of प्रकार 'manner'. As in the following sentences : कथा ग्रामं न पृच्छसि = केन हेतुना ग्रामं न पृच्छसि ॥ कथा देवा आसन् पुराविदः ॥\n\nHere end the affixes having the designation of _Vibhakti_.",
    "53027": "The word दिक् शब्दाः means 'words denoting directions'. Thus पुरस्तात्, has all these three significations in the following sentences, पुरस्तादवसति 'he lives eastward'. पुरस्तादागतः 'he came from east' पुरस्ताद् रमणीयम् 'It was delightful previously'. Similarly with अधस्तात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'after words of direction'? Observe ऐन्द्र्यां दिशि वसति ॥ Why do we say 'ending in the locative, ablative and nominative'? Observe पूर्वम् ग्रामं गतः ॥ Why do we say when the sense is 'a direction', 'a locality' or 'a time'? Observe पूर्वस्मिन् गुरौ वसति 'he lives in the presence of the _guru_'.\n\nThis affix is a स्वार्थिक affix, like the affixes taught previously. The words denoting direction must be primitive words of direction; and not derivative words like ऐन्द्री &c. which also denote direction. The rule of यथासंख्य does not apply here.",
    "53028": "This debars अस्ताति ॥ The word दक्षिणा can never refer to time, so with regard to it direction and locality are only taken. Thus दक्षिणतो वसति, दक्षिणत आगतः, दक्षिणतोरमणीयम् ॥  उत्तरतोवसति, उत्तरत आगतः, उत्तरतोरमणीयम् ॥ The अ of अतस् is for the sake of differentiating this affix from तस् in _sutras_ like (II. 3. 30).",
    "53029": "Thus परतः or परस्तात् or अवरस्तात् or अवरतो वसति, आगतः or रमणीयम् ॥",
    "53030": "Thus प्राक् or प्रत्यक्; प्राच्यां दिशि वसति = प्राग् वसति, प्रागागतः, प्राग्रमणीयम् ॥ The feminine affix of प्राची is also elided, when the _taddhita_ affix is elided by लुक् ॥ See (l. 2. 49).",
    "53031": "These words are derived irregularly from the word ऊर्ध्व, by changing it into उप, and adding the affixes रिल् and रिष्टातिल् ॥ Thus ऊर्ध्वायां दिशि वसति = उपरि वसति. So also उपर्यागतः, उपरि रमणीयम् ॥ उपरिष्टाद्वसति, उपरिष्टादागतः, उपरिष्टद्रमणीयम् ॥",
    "53032": "The word is formed by changing अपर into पश्च, and adding the affix आति ॥ As अपरस्यां दिशि वसति = पश्चाद्वसति, आगतः, रमणीयम् &c.\n\nVart:- So also when अपर is preceded by another word denoting direction, it is changed into _pascha_ and _ati_ is added. As दक्षिणपश्चात् उत्तरपश्चात् ॥\n\nVart:- So also when अर्ध follows such a compound, _apara_ is changed into _pascha_; as, दक्षिणपश्चार्धः, उत्तरपश्चार्धः ॥\n\nVart:- _Apara_ is changed into _pascha_, when followed by _ardha_, and not preceded by any other word. As, पश्चार्धः ॥",
    "53033": "By च, the word पश्चात् is also included. As पुरा व्याघ्रो जायते, पश्च, पश्चा or पश्चात् सिंहः ॥ As प॒॒श्चात् पु॒॒रस्ता॑दध॒॒रादुद॑क्तात् (_Rig_ _Ved_ X. 87. 21) प॒॒श्चेदम॒॒न्यद॑भव॒॒द्यज्ज॑त्रम् (_Rig_. _Veda_. X. 149. 3).",
    "53034": "Thus उत्तरस्यां दिशि वसति = उत्तराद्वसति; उत्तरादागतः, उत्तराद्रमणीयम् ॥ Similarly अधरात् and दक्षिणात् ॥",
    "53035": "The affix अस्ताति and the other affixes taught above come with the force of locative, ablative and nominative. The एनप् comes with the force of locative and nominative and not that of ablative. The adverbs so formed refer to objects not at a distance. Thus उत्तरेण or उत्तरात् or उत्तरतो वसति or रमणीयम् ॥ Similarly अधरेण, अधरात्, अधस्ताद् वसति &c, so also दक्षिणेन, दक्षिणात्, दक्षिणतो वसति &c, 'He lives near by in the north-ward or southward'. Why do we say 'when not denoting distance'. Observe उत्तराद्वस्ति 'he lives far away in the north'. Why do we say 'when not having the force of ablative'? Observe उत्तरादागतः 'come from the north'.\n\nThe word अपञ्चम्याः governs all the succeeding _sutras_ upto (V. 3. 39), exclusive. Some do not read उत्तर &c into this _sutra_: according to them this is a general rule applicable to all words denoting direction. As पूर्वेण ग्रामम्, अपरेण ग्रामम् (II. 3.31). The प् in _enap_ is for the sake of accent (III. 1. 4).",
    "53036": "The word अदूर of the last _sutra_ is not read into this: though the word अपञ्चम्याः governs it. Thus दक्षिणा वसति or रमणीयम्, but दक्षिणत आगतः ॥ The च् in आच् is not for the sake of accent (VI. 1. 163) for the simple affix आ would be _udatta_ by the general rule (III. 1. 3). The च् serves the purpose of differentiating this आ from other affixes in _Sutra_ (II. 3. 29).",
    "53037": "Thus दक्षिणाहि वसति or दक्षिणा वसति 'he lives far away in the south'. Similarly दक्षिणाहिं रमनायम्, दक्षिणा रमणीयम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say दूरे 'when the adverb denotes a distant limit'? Observe दक्षिणतो वसति ॥ The word अपञ्चम्याः governs this also: as, दक्षिणत आगतः ॥",
    "53038": "Thus उत्तरा or उत्तराहि वसति or रमणीयम् \"He lives far away in the north: or the northward far away is pleasant\". But when 'distance' is not meant we have उत्तरेण प्रयाति ॥ The word governs this also: as उत्तरादागतः ॥",
    "53039": "The word अपञ्चम्याः does not govern this _sutra_. Thus पुरो वसति, पुर आगतः, पुरो रमणीयम् ॥   Similarly अधस् and अवस् with वसति, आगतः and रमणीयम् ॥ As अधोवसति अध-आगतः, अधोरमणीयम्, अवोवसति, अवआगतः and अवोरमणीयम् ॥",
    "53040": "That is पुर् for पूर्व, अध् for अधर and अव् for अवर ॥ This _sutra_ indicates by implication that the affix अस्ताति (V. 3. 27) is not debarred by अस् after these words. Thus पुरस्तात् or अधस्तात् or अवस्तात् वसति or आगतः or रमणीयम् ॥",
    "53041": "This declares option when by last it was compulsory. As अवरस्तात् or अवस्तात् वसति आगतः, or रमणीयम् ॥",
    "53042": "The word विधा and प्रकार have the same meaning. The adverbs so formed apply to every kind of action. Thus एकधा भुङ्क्ते 'he eats once'. द्विधा गच्छति 'he goes twice'. Similarly त्रिधा, चतुर्धा, पञ्चधा ॥",
    "53043": "The word संख्यायाः is understood here. The word अधिकरणं means 'matter, stuff, substance'.  विचालः 'change in numbers'. Thus to make one into many, or to make many into one. Thus एकं राशिं कुरु 'divide one heap into five'. अष्टधा कुरु, अनेकमेकधा कुरु ॥",
    "53044": "Thus एकधा राशिं कुरु or ऐकध्यं कुरु, एकधा भुङ्क्ते or ऐकध्यं भुङ्क्ते ॥ The repetition of धा in the _sutra_ shows that the substitution takes place when the sense is that of विधा, as well as when it is that of अधिकरण विचाल ॥ Had धा not been repeated, the substitution would have come in the sense of अधिकरण विचाल only, as immediately preceding this _sutra_.",
    "53045": "Here also it comes in both the विधार्थ and अधिकरण विचाल senses. By च, the word 'optionally' is drawn into the _sutra_. Thus द्विधा or द्वैधम्, त्रिधा, or त्रैधम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix ड (_da_, with the elision of the final vowel) comes without changing the sense, after words ending in _dhamun_. As द्वैध, त्रैध, in पथि द्वैधानि संश्रयन्ते, मति त्रैधानि संश्रयन्ते ॥",
    "53046": "Thus द्वेधा (VI. 4. 148) or द्वैधम् or द्विधा, त्रेधा, त्रैधम् or त्रिधा ॥",
    "53047": "The word याप्य means 'contempt, trifling' &c. Thus वैयाकरणः = वैयाकरणपाशः 'a very bad Grammarian'. So also याज्ञिकपाशः ॥ Of course this will not come in denoting a person who is a good Grammarian, but bears bad character, or who is a good performer of sacrifices but immoral.",
    "53048": "This _sutra_ is made only to teach accent, for the word to which अन् is added undergoes no other change of form except in accent. Thus द्विती꣡यः (V. 2. 54) has _udatta_ on ती (III. 1. 3) but when अन् is added, the accent falls on द्वि (VI. I. 197). Thus द्वितीयो भागः = द्वि꣡तीयः 'the moiety'. Similarly तृ꣡तीयः 'the one-third'. Why do we say when 'part' is meant? Otherwise, there is no change in accent. The affix तीय always comes in forming ordinal numbers and for no other purpose, for the तीय in words like मुखतीय is not significant as it is not an affix. The employment of the word पूरण in the aphorism is useless for the purposes of this _sutra_. Its _anuvritti_, however, runs in the other _sutras_, and that is the only purpose that it serves here.",
    "53049": "This is for accent also. Thus च꣡तुर्थः, प꣡ञ्चमः, स꣡प्तमः, न꣡वमः, द꣡शमः ॥ Why do we say प्रागेकादशः 'before eleven'? Observe एकादशः꣡, द्वादशः꣡ no change of accent (VI. 1. 223). Why do we say 'not in the _Chhandas_'? Observe, पञ्चममिन्द्रियस्यापाक्रामत (पञ्चम꣡ has acute on the final being formed by डट् preceded by मट् (V. 2. 48), (V.  2. 49).",
    "53050": "The words भागे and अछन्दसि are understood here. By च, the affix अन् is included. Thus ष꣡ष्ठः or षा꣡ष्ठः, अ꣡ष्टमः or आ꣡ष्टमः ॥",
    "53051": "The word मान means a grain weight (व्रीहि परिमितं सुवर्ण). That is to say, कन् comes after षष्ठ when a division of मान 'measure' is expressed; and लुक् comes after अष्ट when a part of पश्वङ्ग is denoted. Thus ष꣡ष्ठको भागः 'a sixth of a grain measure'. अष्टमो भागः 'an-eighth part of the body of a beast'. The लुक् here takes the place of the affix ञ as well as अन् ॥ By च, the affixes above mentioned are also employed: as षाष्ठः or षष्ठः, आष्टमः or अष्टमः ॥ When a measure or the body of an animal is not denoted, this rule (though optional) will not apply.",
    "53052": "By the word च, the affix कन् and the elision लुक् also take effect: the elision being of कन् or आकिनिच् ॥ Thus एकाकिन् (nom. एकाकी), एककः or एकः ॥ By using असहाय, it is indicated that the word एक here is not a numeral meaning 'one', but a noun meaning 'alone'. एकोऽन्यार्थे प्रधाने च, प्रथमे, केवले तथा ॥ साधारणे, समानेऽल्पे, संख्यायां च प्रयुज्यते ॥ So that this word will have dual एकाकिनौ, and the plural एकाकिनः ॥",
    "53053": "The word भूतपूर्व is a compound of पूर्व and भूतः the compounding being by सुप्सुपा, and denotes something done in a past time. Thus आढ्यो भतपूर्वः = आढ्यचरः 'once opulent'. सुकुमारचरः ॥ The ट् indicates that the feminine will be in ङीप्; as, आढ्यचरी ॥ The च् is not इत् in चरट् though required by (1. 3. 7). This proves that चुटु rule is _anitya_. The _sutra_ (V. 2. 18) might have been read after this, with the saving of the word भूतपूर्वः, but then खञ् would have debarred चरट् which is, however, not intended.",
    "53054": "The word भूतपूर्व here qualifies the sense of the affix, and not the sense of the base, as it in the last _sutra_. Thus देवदत्तस्य भूतपूर्वो गौः = देवदत्तरूप्यः 'the cow that formerly belonged to _Devadatta_'. Similarly देवदत्तचरः ॥",
    "53055": "These affixes form the superlative degree. The word अतिशायन is an irregular form of अतिशयनं, and it qualifies the sense of the primitive. The स्वार्थिक affixes sometimes qualify the sense of the primitive. Thus आढ्यतमः = सर्व इमे आढ्याः, अयमेषामतिशयेनाढ्यः 'the richest' i. e. 'these are all rich, but he surpasses them all in riches'. Similarly दर्शनीयतमः 'most handsome'. सुकुमारतमः &c. Similarly पटु-पटिष्ठः, गुरु-गरिष्ठः, लघु-लघिष्ठः (VI. 4. 155). When among superlatives, further excellence is indicated, then these words may take additional affixes : as श्रेष्ठ, though a superlative, forms श्रेष्ठतमः ॥ As देवो वः सविता प्रार्पयतु श्रेष्ठतमाय कर्मणे । युधिष्ठिरः श्रेष्ठतमः कुरूणामिति ॥",
    "53056": "By ङ्याप्प्रातिपदिकात् (IV. I. I) whose force runs throughout, the _taddhita_ affixes are ordained only after nominal stems; they would not have come after verbs, hence this _sutra_. Thus पचतितमाम् (the आम् is added by (V. 4. 11) = सर्व इमे पचन्तीति, अयमेषामतिशयेन पचति, 'he cooks surprisingly'. जल्पतितमाम् &c. The affix इष्ठन् never comes after a verb, as by (V. 3. 58), it is restricted to adjectives.",
    "53057": "The word द्विवचन does not mean 'dual', but means an expression for two. विभज्य is irregularly formed by यत्, and means 'that which is to be distinguished or differentiated'. This debars तमप् and इष्ठन् ॥ The rule of यथासंख्य (I. 3. 10) does not apply here. First to take an example of द्विवचन or when comparison is between two things : thus: द्वाविमावाढ्यौ, अयमनयोरतिशयेन = आढ्यतरः 'both are rich, but he is richer amongst the two'. Similarly सुकुमारतरः, पचतितराम्, जल्पतितराम् (V. 4. 11): or with इयसुन् : as, द्वाविमौ पटू, अयमनयोरतिशयेन पटुः = पटीयान् 'more skillful of the two', लघीयान् ॥ Secondly to take an example of विभज्यते चोपपदे i.e. when a word in construction is to be differentiated: thus माथुराः पाटलिपुत्रकेभ्य आढ्यतराः 'The men of _Mathura_ are richer than those of _Pataliputra_'. Here there are more than two things, but as the words are expressed in the sentence, the comparative degree in plural number is used. Similarly दर्शनीयतराः, पटीयांसः, लघीयांसः ॥ Of course all these words must be plural, as they refer to more than two persons.",
    "53058": "The affixes इष्ठन् and ईयसुन् are restricted in their scope by this _sutra_ i. e. they come only after adjectives or adverbs, in expressing comparative and superlative degrees. Thus लघीयान् , लघिष्टः, पटीयान्, पटिष्टः; but not after words like पाचक &c. There we have पाचकतरः, पाचकतमः ॥ The word एव 'only' restricts the scope of the affixes, and not of the primitives. Thus पटुतरः, पटुतमः are also valid forms.",
    "53059": "The तुः is ablative of तृ which includes both तृन् and तृच् ॥ This extends the application of these affixes to words other than attributes. Thus अतिशयेन कर्ता = करिष्ठः (कर्तृ + इष्ठन् = कर् + इष्ठ by (VI. 4. 154), तृ is elided) As आसुर्ति करिष्ठः, दोहीयसी धेनुः ॥ By _Vartika_ under (VI. 3.35) दोहित्री is changed into masculine दोहितृ and then ईयस् is added, when तृ is elided by (VI. 4. 154).",
    "53060": "Though प्रशस्य is not an attribute, it takes these affixes by the application of this rule. The _anuvritti_ of अजादी runs here, but the word must be changed into locative for the purposes of this aphorism, and which will read thus प्रशस्यस्य श्रोऽजाद्योः ॥ Thus सर्व इमे प्रशस्या अयमेषामतिशयेन प्रशस्यः = श्रेष्ठः, उभाविमौ प्रशस्यौ, अयमनयोरतिशयेन प्रशस्यः = श्रेयान् ॥ Rule (VI. 4. 163) prevents the elision of the अ of श्र, which otherwise would have been elided by (VI. 4. 148) and (V. 4. 155). These words are equal to प्रशस्यतरः and प्रशस्यतमः ॥",
    "53061": "As ज्येष्ठः, ज्यायान् (आ is substituted for the ई of ईयस् by (VI. 4. 160)).",
    "53062": "Thus ज्येष्ठः 'the oldest', ज्यायान् 'the older'. By (VI. 4. 157), वर्षि is also substituted for वृद्ध; and we have वर्षीष्ठः and वर्षीयान् also. The word वृद्ध though not a _gunavachana_, takes these affixes by the implication of this _sutra_.",
    "53063": "Thus नेदिष्ठम्, नेदीयः, साधिष्ठः and साधीयान् ॥ सर्वाणीमान्यन्तिकानि इदमेषामतिशयेन, नेदिष्टम् । उभे इमे अन्तिके इदमनयोरतिशयेन नेदीयः । इदमस्मान्नेदीयः । सर्वइमे बाढमधीयते । अयमस्मात्साधीयोधीते ॥",
    "53064": "Thus कनिष्ठः, कनीयान् or यविष्ठः, यवीयान्; similarly अल्पिष्ठ, अल्पीयान्, or कनिष्ठः, कनीयान् ॥ सर्वइमे युवानः, अयमेषामतिशयेन, कनिष्ठः । द्वाविमौ युवानौ अयमनयोरतिशयेन, कनीयान् । यविष्टः । यवीयान् । सर्वइमेऽल्पाः । अयमेषामतिशयेन, कनिष्ठः । उभाविमावल्पावयमनयोरतिशयेन कनीयान् । अयमस्मात्कनीयान् । अल्पिष्ठः अल्पीयानिति वा ॥",
    "53065": "Thus स्रग्विन्-स्रजिष्ठः, स्रजीयान्; त्वग्वत्-त्वचिष्ठः, त्वचीयान् ॥ सर्वइमे स्रग्विणः, अयमेषामतिशयेन, स्रजिष्ठः । उभाविमौ स्रग्विणौ, अयमनयोरतिशयेन, स्रजीयान् । अयमस्मात् स्रजीयाम् । सर्वइमे त्वग्वन्तः अयमेषामतिशयेन, त्वचिष्ठः । उभाविमौ त्वग्वन्तौ, अयमनयोरतिशयेन, त्वचीयाम् अयमस्मात्त्वचीयान् ॥ This _sutra_ is a _jnapaka_ or indicator that words ending in विन् and मत् or वत् form their comparative and superlative degrees by adding ईयस् and इष्ठन् ॥",
    "53066": "The word प्रशंसा means 'praise', and it qualifies the sense of the primitive; i. e. when the sense of the primitive is that of 'praise', then रूपप् is added. As a general rule the स्वार्थिक affixes, which do not change the denotation of the word, serve the purpose of prominently bringing forward one particular meaning out of the several meanings possessed by a primitive. Thus प्रशस्तो वैयाकरणः = वैयाकरणरूपः 'a celebrated Grammarian'. So also याज्ञिकरूपः ॥ The praise may be implied by the sense of the primitive, without being absolute praise: thus चोररूपः 'a celebrated thief', दस्युरूपः 'a celebrated robber'; a person very expert in his evil courses even; these word being applied to a thief who is so dexterous that he can steal 'the collyrium from the eye-lashes', or 'a horse from under the rider', without the latter being aware of it.\n\nThe affix comes after a verbal word ending in तिङ्, for the word तिङश्च (V. 3. 56) is understood here also. Thus पचतिरूपम्, पचतोरूपम् or पचन्तिरूपम् 'who is celebrated, who two are celebrated or who all are celebrated in cooking'. These words पचतिरूपम् &c cannot take dual or plural; because the action denoted by the verb is only one, not many. These words are always in the neuter gender, by the general usage of the people.",
    "53067": "The word समाप्ति means 'fullness of objects'. A little non-fullness is called ईषदसमाप्ति ॥ Thus पटुकल्पः, पटुदेश्यः or पटुदेशीयः 'clever but slightly incomplete' i. e. 'tolerably clever'. मृदुकल्पः, मृदुदेश्यः, मृदुदेशीयः ॥ So also after verbs, as पचतिकल्पम्, जल्पतिकल्पम् ॥ &c.",
    "53068": "This is the only exception to the general rule that an affix is added after a word. The affix बहुच् however is added before the word. The च् of बहुच् indicates that the _udatta_ will fall on the final vowel of the word. See (VI. I. 163). Thus बहुपटुः꣡ 'a tolerably skillful person'. बहुमृदुः꣡, बहुगुडा꣡ दाक्षाः ॥ By the word 'optionally' it is indicated that the affixes कल्प &c also come. By using the word सुपः 'to a noun ending in a case-affix i. e a declined noun', it is indicated that the affix is not added to finite verbs (तिङन्त) ॥",
    "53069": "That which distinguishes one thing from another is called प्रकार or 'speciality'. When a word expresses speciality, it is called प्रकारवचनः ॥ This word qualifies the sense of the primitive. The affix जातीयर् and the affix याल् (V. 3. 23) both denote प्रकार, but while जातीयर् denotes प्रकारवान्, the other denotes प्रकारमात्र i. e. merely प्रकार ॥\n\nThus पटुजातीयः 'he may be reckoned among the clever persons'. So also मृदुजातीयः, दर्शनीयजातीयः ॥  \n\nThe above _Sutra_ may, therefore, be translated in these words also, \"the affix जातीय has the sense of \"belonging to the class of\", \"being of the nature of\".",
    "53070": "Properly speaking क extends only upto (V. 3. 86). Thus in the _sutra_ अज्ञाते (V. 3. 73), the word क must be supplied to complete the sense. As अश्वकः, गर्दभकः ॥ This affix क does not come after finite verbs (तिङन्त), but the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71) comes after such verbs. In other words, the phrase तिङश्च (V. 3. 56), should be connected, by way of _anuvritti_, with the next _sutra_, and not with this.",
    "53071": "The च् shows that the acute accent falls on the final (VI. 1. 163), though the affix is inserted in the middle of the word. The phrase तिङश्च (V. 3. 56) is understood here also. This अकच् debars क ॥ Thus उच्चैः + अक् = उच्च् + अक् + ऐः = उच्च॒॒कैः; similarly नीच॒॒कैः, शमकैः from नीचैः and शनैः ॥ So also after Pronominals, as सर्वके, विश्वके and उभयके from सर्वे, विश्वे and उभये ॥ In these last examples, it will be seen that the affix is added to सुबन्त words i.e. to declined nouns, and not to प्रातिपदिक or crude-noun: as was required by (IV. 1. 1). Sometimes, however, the affix is added after a _Pratipadika_ also. The usage will determine when the affix should be added to a Nominal stem (_Pratipadika_) and when to a _Subanta_ word. Thus in युष्मकाभिः, अस्मकाभिः, युष्मकासु, अस्मकासु, युवकयोः, आवकयोः, the affix is added to _pratipadika_ viz to युष्मद्, अस्मद्, giving युष्मकद्, अस्मकद् which are then declined as Pronominals. But in the examples त्वयका, मयका त्वयकि, मयकि, the affix अक् is added to the त्वया, मया (the Instrumental case of युष्मद् and अस्मद्), and त्वयि and मयि the Locative singular of the same. From the above examples, this rule may be deduced; the affix अक् is added to the _Pradipadika_, when case-affixes beginning with ओ, स or भ follows; and the affix is added to the declined pronoun, in the remaining cases.\n\nVart:- The affix काम् is added to the Indeclinable तूष्णीम् ॥ The म् is indicatory, therefore, का comes before the final vowel (1. 1.47). As तूष्णीम् + का = तूष्णीकाम्, as तूष्णीकामास्ते, तूष्णीकां तिष्ठति 'he remained silent'. When, however, the meaning in that 'whose habit is so', then the affix क is added, and the म् of तूष्णीम् is elided. As तूष्णीकः 'a taciturn'.\n\nThe phrase तिङश्च (V. 3. 56) being understood here, the affix अक् comes after finite verbs also. As पचति-पचतकि, जल्पति-जल्पतकि ॥",
    "53072": "The word अव्यय is to be read into this _sutra_ and not सर्वनाम, because no Pronominal ends in क् ॥ Thus धकित्, हिरकुत् and पृथकत् from धिक्, हिरुक् and पृथक् ॥ Thus हिरुक् + अक् = हिर् + अक् + उक् = हिरकुत्, now comes the present rule and the final क् is changed into द्, as हिरकुद् or त् ॥",
    "53073": "This अज्ञात or want of knowledge refers not to the object itself, but to its relation with some other object. As अश्वकः 'whose horse?' गर्दभकः 'the ass' (of whom is this)? उष्ट्रकः &c. Similarly in उच्चकैः 'high' (is it so?) नीचकैः 'Is it low'? सर्वके 'was this agreed to by all'? So also विश्वके ॥ Similarly पचतकि \"He cooks, is it?\" जल्पतकि 'He speaks, does he?'",
    "53074": "Thus अश्वकः 'a sorry horse'. उष्ट्रकः, गर्दभकः, उच्चकैः, नीचकैः सर्वके, विश्वक ॥ पचतकि 'he cooks comtemptibly'. जल्पतकि 'he speaks insignificantly'.",
    "53075": "The word कुत्सिते of the last _sutra_ is understood here also. This कन् debars क ॥ शुद्रकः, धारकः, चूर्णकः ॥",
    "53076": "The word अनुकम्पा means  'compassion, pity, endearment'. Thus पुत्रकः 'the little child', 'poor child'. वत्सकः, दुर्बलकः, बुभुक्षिकः, विश्वसितकि 'fie ! he trusts'. स्वपितकि 'alas ! he sleeps'. The two latter are examples of finite verbs taking this affix.",
    "53077": "The word नीति means 'policy' or 'expedient', such as 'conciliation', 'dissension' and 'punishment'. तद्युक्तात् means 'joined with that, i.e. with gift compassion'. In other words, the things signified by the bases, are connected as means of relief with the persons or things that have been objects of compassion. Thus, हन्त ते धानकाः 'alas! here are barley for you'. हन्त ते तिलकाः 'alas! here are sesamun for you'. एहकि, अद्धकि 'O dear! come and eat'. (These words are supposed to be addressed to a person who is starving, by one who wants to relieve him. _Iyengar_). Being moved with compassion, he entreats coursteously the object of sympathy, with gifts to relieve his want. In the last _Sutra_, the affix was added, in the sense of compassion, to the name of the person or action that evoked pity. In the present _sutra_, the affix is added to the object or action by which pity is shown. The word एहकि is from एहि the Imperative second person Singular of इ 'to go' with the _upasarga_ आ ॥",
    "53078": "In the alternative we have कन् also. As अनुकम्पितो देवदत्तः = देविकः (देवदत्त + इक = देव + इक) (V. 3. 83). When कन् is added there is no shortening of the base, as देवदत्तकः ॥ Similarly यज्ञिकः or यज्ञदत्तकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say बह्वचः 'after a polysyllable?' Observe दत्तकः, गुप्तकः ॥ Why do we say 'being a Man-name'? Observe मद्रबाहुकः, भद्रबाहुकः which are epithets and not Proper Nouns (मद्रौ बाहू यस्य); or these are names of quadrupeds.",
    "53079": "The force of च is that the other affix कन् also comes, as well as ठच् ॥ Thus from देवदत्त we have: देवियः, देविलः, देविकः, देवदत्तकः ॥ So from यज्ञदत्तः—यज्ञिकः, यज्ञिलः यज्ञिकः, यज्ञदत्तकः ॥ (V. 3. 83).",
    "53080": "The च shows that the former affixes also come. The sense of the affixes are the same as above viz. compassion or courtesy. Thus from the word उपेन्द्रदत्त, we have, 1. उपेन्द्रदत्तकः (_kan_), उपिकः (_thach_), 3, उपिलः (_ilach_), 4. उपियः (_ghan_), 5. उपकः (_vuch_), 6. उपडः (_adach_). The shortened forms are by (V. 3. 83). In diminutives, the forms are generally shortened. The word प्राचां is used as a sign of respect (_pujartha_), for the word वा was understood in the aphorism by _anuvritti_ from (V. 3. 78).",
    "53081": "The जातिनामन् are words like व्याघ्र &c which are well-known names of particular species of animals &c, but which are come to be applied to men by way of metaphor. The _anuvritti_ of बह्वचः does not extend to it. This is a general rule. Thus व्याघ्रकः, सिंहकः, शरमकः ॥ The word वा being understood in the _sutra_, the previous affixes also come, as, व्याघ्रिलः, सिंहिलः ॥ The word नामन् is used along with जाति, to prevent the affix being added to the word-form जाति (1. 1. 68).",
    "53082": "The words कन् and मनुष्यनाम्नः are understood in this _sutra_. Thus व्याघ्रकः from व्याघ्राजिनः, and सिंहकः from सिंहाजिनः ॥ _Vyaghrajina_ and _Sinhajina_ are names of men.",
    "53083": "_Karika_\n\nचतुर्थादनजादौ च लोपः पूर्वपदस्य च ।\nअप्रत्यये तथैवेष्ट उवर्णाल्ल इलस्य च ॥\n\nThe word लोप is understood here from the last _sutra_ The word ऊर्द्ध्वम् indicates that the whole of that portion of the term which follows the second vowel should be elided, otherwise, only the first letter of the third syllable would have been elided by (1. 1. 54). The illustrations have been given above. Thus देवदत्त + इक; here all the letters after the अ of देव should be elided : as देविकः, so also देवियः, देविलः ॥\n\nThe affix ठ is replaced by इक् or क (VII. 3. 50) and (VII. 3. 51) hence its special mention in this _sutra_. For had it not been used, the _sutra_ would have run thus. 'When an affix beginning with a vowel follows &c'. This rule would have applied to इक substitute of ठ, but not to क substitute of ठ which comes after words ending in उ, ऋ, त्, इस् and उस् ॥ But it is intended that क (and not इक) substitute of ठ should be added to words whose second syllables end in उक् (उ or ऋ) vowels. If it be said that इक substitute of ठ would be sufficient for words like वायुदत्त &c. also as it will cause the elision of the third and subsequent syllables; and when such syllables are elided, क would be the proper substitute to add to वायु and not इक, which we can do by the rule of _sthanivat_; we say, it is not so. For if it were the case, we should add the क substitute and not इक in the following: मथित + ठक् (VI. 4. 51)= मथित् + ठक् (VI. 4. 148), because, after elision, मथित् ends with त् ॥ But we know that क is not added but इक, and we have मथितिकः ॥ Hence the emplyment if ठ in the _sutra_ is proper as वायुदत्तः—वायुकः, पितृदत्तः-पितृकः ॥\n\nVart:- It should be stated that the portion after the fourth vowel is elided in certain cases. As अनुकम्पितो बृहस्पतिदत्तः-बृहस्पतिकः, बृहस्पतियः, बृहस्पतिलः ॥\n\nVart:- When an affix not beginning with a vowel follows, the elision is optional. Thus देवदत्त + कन् = देवदत्तकः or देवकः, यज्ञदत्तकः or यज्ञकः ॥\n\nVart:- There is elision of the first term, when these affixes ठच् &c denoting compassion, whether beginning with vowel or not, follow. Thus दत्तिकः, दत्तिलः, दत्तियः, दत्तकः from देवदत्त or यज्ञदत्त or वायुदत्त &c.\n\nVart:- The dimunitive of compassion or endearment may be formed without adding any affix, by simply dropping either the first or the second term of the name. Thus दत्तः or देव from देवदत्तः, सत्यभामा—भामा & सत्या ॥\n\nVart:- The affix इल is replaced by ल after a word ending in उ as, भानुलः from भानुदत्तः, वसुलः—वसुदत्तः ॥ So also after a word ending in ऋ as सवितृलः ॥\n\nVart:- When the second vowel is ओ, औ, ए or ऐ, then this is also elided. As लहिकः from लहोडः, कहिकः from कहोडः ॥\n\nVart:- When the first member consists of a single syllable, there is elision of the second member : as वाचिकः from वागीशाः (the ग् changed back to च् because the stem is now भ and not पद, and rule (VIII. 2. 39) does not apply.) So also; स्रुचिकः, त्वचिकः ॥ The form षडिकः (and not षषिकः from षष्) is an exception. It is dimunitive of षडङ्गुलिदत्तः ॥",
    "53084": "This debars the previous _sutra_. Thus अनुकम्पितः शेवलदत्तः = शेवलिकः, शेवलियः, शेवलिलः, सुपरिकः, सुपरियः, सुपरिलः from सुपरिदत्तः; so also विशालिकः, विशालियः, विशालिलः, वरुणिकः, वरुणियः, वरुनिलः, अर्यमिकः, अर्यमियः, and अर्यमिलः ॥\n\nVart:- The third vowel must be the original third vowel, and not that which results from _Sandhi_. Thus in शेवलेन्द्रदत्तः and सुपार्याशीर्दत्तः; though the apparent third vowels are ए and आ, but they being the result of compounding between शेवल + इन्द्र and सुपारि + आशीस्; the original vowels are taken. Thus शेवलिकः from शेवलेन्द्रदतः, and सुपरिकः from सुपार्याशीर्दत्तः; and not शवलेयिकः and सुपयिकः ॥",
    "53085": "Thus अल्पं तैलं = तैलकं 'a little oil'. सर्वकम्, घृतकम्, विश्वकम्, उच्चकैः, नीचकैः 'a somewhat high, a somewhat low &c'. पचतकि 'he cooks a little'. जल्पतकि 'he speaks somewhat'.",
    "53086": "The हृस्व here is opposed to दीर्घ or 'long'. Thus हृस्वोवृक्षः-वृक्षकः 'a small tree'. प्लक्षकः, स्तम्भकः ॥",
    "53087": "Thus वंशकः, वेणुकः, दण्डकः ॥ This debars क ॥",
    "53088": "The word हृस्व is understood here, but not संज्ञा ॥ This debars क (V. 3. 90). Thus हृस्वा कुटी = कुटीरः, शमीरः and शुण्डारः ॥ The derivatives are masculine names; though the primitives are feminine.",
    "53089": "This debars क ॥ Thus कुतुपः, from कुतू the long ऊ being elided owing to ड ॥ It means a small leathern vessel for oil. This word is neuter also, as, कुतुपम् ॥",
    "53090": "Thus हृस्वा कासूः = कासूतरी 'a small lance'; गोणीतरी 'a small sack'.",
    "53091": "The _anuvritti_ of हृस्व ceases. Thus वत्सतरः 'a weaned calf' becoming slender in reaching the second period of its age. उक्षतरः 'a slender bull': being the third age of a वत्स ॥ अश्वतरः 'a mule': (तस्य तनुत्वमन्यपितृकता); वृषभतरः 'a slender bull or that cannot draw the load'.",
    "53092": "This affix comes in the _svartha_ sense. The differentiation of a portion from the whole by means of its peculiar caste, action, attribute or name is called निर्द्धारण or specification. Thus कतरो भवतोः कठः 'amongst you two, who is _Katha_'. कतरो भवतोः कारकः 'amongst you two, who is the agent'. कतरो भवतोः पटुः 'amongst you two, who is clever'. कतरो भवतोः देवदत्तः 'which of the two amongst you is _Devadatta_'. Similarly यतरः 'of the two the one who', ततरः 'of the two--that one'. as यतरो भवतो देवदत्तः, ततर आगच्छतु 'of the two, let that one who is _Devadatta_, come'. The _taddhita_ affixes being optional (IV. 1. 82), this idea may be expressed by a sentence also. As, को भवतो देवदत्तः, स आगच्छतु 'who amongst you two is _Devadatta_, let him come'.",
    "53093": "The words किंयत्तदः and निरर्धारणे एकस्य are to be read into the _sutra_. Thus कतमो भवतां कठः 'which of you, Sirs, is a _Katha_ _Brahmana_?' यतमो भवतां कठः, ततम आगच्छतु 'that one of you, Sirs, who is a _Katha_, let him come'. The word वा 'optionally' indicates that the affix अकच् (V. 3. 71) also comes, as यको भवतां कठः, तकः, आगच्छतु ॥ This idea may be expressed by a sentence also, owing to the महाविभाषा (IV. 1. 82): as, को भवतां कठः; यो भवतां कठः, स आगच्छतु ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when question is that of caste'? Observe, को भवतां देवदत्तः. Here the question is about a Name: and not _jati_. The word परिप्रश्न applies to किम् only, the pronouns यत् and तत् not being interrogative pronouns. But the word जाति applies to all these three pronouns.\n\nAccording to some, the affix डतर has also this force, after the word किम्, as, कतरो भवतां कठः 'which of you, Sirs, is a _Katha_ _Brahmana_?' कतरो भवतां कलापः. As may be inferred from the _sutra_ कतरकतमौ जातिपरिप्रश्ने (IV. 1. 63)",
    "53094": "The च draws in डतरच् ॥ That is डतरच् comes when one out of two is to be specified; and डतमच् when one out of many is to be specified. The word जातिपरिप्रश्ने does not govern this _sutra_: it being a general rule. Thus एकतरो भवतोर्देवदत्तः, एकतमो भवतां देवदत्तः ॥\n\nThe word प्राचाम् is for _pujartha_; the word वा being already understood in the _sutra_.",
    "53095": "Thus व्याकरणकः 'Grammar' used in a derisive sense, when its study produces pride. As व्याकरणकेन नाम त्वं गर्वितः 'thou art proud, because thou hast read grammar only'. याज्ञिक्यकेन नाम त्वं गर्वितः ॥ Here the words व्याकरणक and याज्ञिक्यक are used in a mocking sense. When, however, the derision applies to the person itself, then कन् is added by (V. 3.14): as देवदत्तकः &c. \n\nSo far the governing power of क (V. 3.70).",

The repetition of the word लोप in this rule, therefore, indicates that the elision ordained here is not one caused by the affix. For if the elision had been caused by the affix, then by (I. 1. 57), such लोपादेश or \"substitute\" would be equivalent to the principal (_sthanivat_); and would thus debar the application of the rule (VI. 4. 130) by which पाद् _pad_ (and not _pada_) is changed into पद् ॥ In other words, the _lopa_ taught by यस्येति च is परनिमित्तक or caused by some thing which is subsequent, namely by a _taddhita_ affix or by इ or ई affix; therefore, this _lopa_ would be _sthani_-_vat_ for the purposes of the rule which would apply to something preceding it (1. 1. 57). Therefore, _pad_ becomes _sthani_-_vat_ to _pada_. Therefore, the _anga_ or base ending with '_pada_' will be called भ, and not the base ending with '_pad_', and therefore (VI. 4. 130) which applies to भ bases will not apply, and there will be no substitution of पद् for पाद्, as there is not in the form पादाय. But we want such substitution and hence the employment of words \"the final of the stem is elided\".\n\nThus द्वौ द्वौ पादौ ददाति \"he gives two quarters to each\" = द्विपदिकां ददाति (द्विपाद + वुन् = द्विपाद् + वुन् = द्विपत् + वुन्) (VI. 4. 130) = द्विपदिका (VII. 3. 44) by which अ of अक् is changed into इ). Similarly द्वे द्वे शते ददाति = द्विशतिकां ददाति ॥\n\nThe compounds above formed are _taddhitartha_ _Tatpurusha_ compounds, viz. compounds containing the sense of a _taddhita_ affix, by rule (II. I. 51). After the compound is formed, then the affix वुन् is added. Thus first we have द्विपाद and द्विशत compounded by (II. I. 51) and then the affix is added. The words पाद and शत when not so compounded, take वुन् affix only in the feminine.\n\nWhy do we say \"of the words पाद and शत\"? Observe द्वौ द्वौ माषौ ददाति, no affixing. Why do we say \"preceded by a numeral?\" Observe पादं पादं ददाति ॥ Why do we say \"in a distributive sense\"?  Observe द्वौपादौ ददाति \"He gives two quarters:\" द्वे शते ददाति ॥\n\nThe enumeration of पाद and शत is useless, as the affix is found after other words also. As, द्विमोदकिकां ददाति \"he gives two cakes to each\". त्रिमोदकिकां ददाति ॥",

This _sutra_ is begun to show that the \"distributive sense\" does not apply here. Thus द्वौ पादौ दण्डितः = द्विपदिकाम् दाण्डितः \"punished with the infliction of a fine of two _Padas_\" (a quarter coin)\". द्वौ पादौ व्यवसृजति = द्विपदिकां व्यवसृजात \"he makes a gift of two _Padas_\".

The word कृष्ण takes कन् when _tila_ is meant; as कृष्णप्रकारास्तिला = कृष्णकाः ॥ यव takes कन् when meaning व्रीहि, as यवकाः ॥ इक्षु, तिल, पाद्य, काल,  and अवदात take this affix when wine is meant, a पाद्यिका, कालिका, अवदातिका \"a kind of wine\".  गोमूत्र takes this affix when meaning a covering, as गोमूत्रकः 'a covering of the colour of cow's wine, or _go_-_mutra_ may mean a certain arrangement of colours such as white and black\". सुरा takes कन् meaning a snake, as सुरकः (VII. 4. 13) \"a kind of snake of the color of wine\". जीर्ण takes it when meaning _sali_ grain, as जीर्णकाः = जीर्णकल्पा शालयः ॥ The following is a list of _Sthuladi_ words.\n\n1 स्थूल, 2 अणु, 3 माष, 4 इषु, 5 कृष्ण तिलेषु, 6 यव व्रीहिषु, 7 इक्षुतिलपाद्यकालावदाताः सुरायाम्, 8 गोमूत्र आच्छादने, 9 सुरा अहौ, 10 जीर्ण शालिषु, 11 पत्रमूले समस्तव्यस्ते, 12 कुमारीपुत्र, 13 कुमारीश्वशुर (कुमार, श्वशुर), 14 मणि ॥",

    "54005": "When the word सामि or any other word having this sense, is compounded with a participle in क्त, the affix कन् is not added to denote the sense of incompleteness. Thus सामिकृतम्, सामिभुक्तम् &c (II. 1. 27). The word वचन shows that the synonyms of सामि are also to be taken. Thus अर्द्धकृतम्, नेमकृतम् &c.\n\nObjection:-- It is redundant to have prohibited कन् after a word preceded by 'half', because the word \"half\" itself shows that the action has not been completed.\n\nAnswer:-- The prohibition contained in this _sutra_ does not refer to the कन् of the last _sutra_, where it has the sense of \"incompleteness\". It refers to that कन् which comes after a word, without changing the sense of that word (स्वार्थे कन्) ॥ Thus the words भिन्नतर and भिन्नतम (the comparative and superlative degrees of भिन्न) show by the very fact of their comparison, that the action denoted by them is not complete. These words भिन्नतर and भिन्नतम also take the affix कन् without change of sense. As भिन्नतरकः and भिम्मतमकः ॥ and बहुतरकं &c as used by _Patanjali_ himself in the following sentences:-- एवं हि सूत्रमभिन्नतरकं भवति, एतैर्हि बहुतरकं व्याप्यते ॥ This कन् is also prohibited in the case of compounds with सामि ॥ In fact, this _sutra_ teaches by implication _Jnapaka_) that कन् comes also in the sense of _svartha_.",

    "54007": "The force of ख is स्वार्थ i e. it does not change the sense of the word. The word अषडक्ष means \"that which has not six eyes\". षडक्ष is compounded from षट् + अक्ष्णि by adding षच् (V. 4. 113) \"having six eyes\". The affix ख is to be added to this word already ending in the affix _shach_. Thus अषडक्षीणे मन्त्रः \"a secret not having six eyes\". i. e. \"a secret known or determined by two persons only to the exclusion of a third\". Similarly आशितंगवीनं अरण्यम् = आशिता गावोऽस्मिन्नरण्ये = प्रभूतयवसं \"a forest where formerly cattle had grazed\". The augment मुम् is added to आशित by _nipata_, or irregularly. So also अलंकर्मीणः = अलं समर्थः कर्मणे पर्याप्तः = competent to do any act, clever. So अलं पुरुषीणः = अलं समर्थः पुरुषाय = प्रतिमल्लादिः = fit for a man.\n\nA word ending with अधि, will be a _Tatpurusha_ compound, by (II. I. 40), as the word अधि belongs to _Saundadi_ class.

The above words always occur with this affix and never without it. while in the case of other words taught hereafter this affix comes optionally. There are other affixes also which are _svarthika_ and _nitya_.

The affix अञ् comes after such a word without changing the sense, when the thing denoted is feminine Thus व्यावक्रोशी, व्यावहासी वर्त्तते ॥\n\nQ.-Why the word स्त्री \"feminine\" is repeated in this _sutra_, when we already know from (III. 3. 43) that णच् comes only after feminine words; and a _svarthika_ affix like अञ् coming after a feminine word will keep the word feminine?.\n\nAns.- The repetition of the word स्त्री in this _sutra_, teaches by implication (_jnapaka_) the following \"स्वार्थिकाः प्रत्ययाः प्रकृतितो लिंगवचनान्यतिवर्त्तन्तेऽपि\" :- \"Sometimes it happens that bases which are derived by means of affixes that do not convey any particular meaning of their own, but leave the meaning which is conveyed by the original to which they are added, unchanged, do not take their gender and number from those original bases from which they are derived\". Thus गुडकल्पा द्राक्षा, तैलकल्पा प्रसन्ना (सुरा विशेषः) formed by adding the _swartha_ affix कल्प (V. 3. 67) to गुड and तैल, the resultant words being in the feminine gender. Similarly from देव-देवता is derived without change of meaning, but change of gender.",
    "54015": "By (III. 3. 44), the affix इनुण् is added to a root to express a condition resulting from a universal co-operation of the action denoted by the root. But a word formed by इनुण् is after all an imaginary word, it requires the further addition of this affx अण् to make it a complete word. In fact, all _svartha_ affixes generally complete the not fully developed word. Thus सांराविणम् वर्त्तते, सांकूटिनम् ॥",
    "54016": "Thus वैसारिणः \"a fish\". Why do we say \"when it means a fish\"? Observe विसारी देवदत्तः \"_Devadatta_ who is gliding out\".",
    "54017": "This is also a _svartha_ affix. The word अभ्यावृत्तिः means \"again and again or repetition\". The counting of actions belonging to the same class and having the same agent, which occur again and again is called क्रियाभ्यावृत्तिगणनम् ॥ Thus पंचवारान् भुङ्क्ते = पंचकृत्वोभुक्तं \"he eats five times\". So also सप्तकृत्वः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"after a Numeral\"? Observe भूरीन् वारान् भुंक्ते \"he eats many times\".\n\nObjection:- Why do we say \"action\" when we know that an 'action' alone can be repeated, and not a substance or an attribute? Reply: The word क्रिया is employed in this _sutra_ for the sake of the next _sutras_, into which its _anuvritti_ flows. Thus in _sutra_ (V. 4. 19), एकस्य सकृच्च when the affix does not apply to count repetition, because it is impossible for a unit to express repetition; but merely to count the \"action\" only.\n\nWhy do we use the word \"repetition\"? The affix will not apply when merely \"actions\" are counted. Thus पंचपाकाः \"five cookings\", दशपाकाः &c.\n\nWhy do we use the word \"counting\", when we know that a Numeral is nothing but counting ? Had the _sutra_ been merely संख्यायाः क्रियाभ्यावृत्तौ कृत्वसुच्, there would arise this anomaly. The numerals upto ten denote only the thing numbered (संख्येय), but the numerals above those denote both the counting (संख्यान) and the thing counted (संख्येय) ॥ If गणन were not used, the affix would come only after the numeral denoting _sankhyeya_ and not _sankhyana_. Thus it will apply to शतवारान् भुङ्क्ते = शतकृत्वः, but not here शतं वाराणां भुङ्क्ते; because here the word शत does not denote repetition, but merely a counting. By using the word गणन it applies to both.",

Thus चतुर् (चतेरुरन् _Un_ V. 58, being formed with the affix '_uran_' added to चत्), and चतुर् (with सुच्).",
    "54019": "This debars कृत्वसुच् ॥ The 'repetition' being impossible, the action alone is counted : so the _anuvritti_ of क्रिया only runs into this _sutra_ and not of अभ्यावृत्तिः ॥ Thus सकृद्भुङ्क्ते \"he eats once\" सकृदधीते ॥ The स् of सुच् is elided by (VIII. 2. 23). But not here in एकः पाकः as being against usage.",
    "54020": "This debars कृत्वसुच् which comes in the alternative. The word अविप्रकृष्ट \"not remote\", qualifies क्रियाभ्यावृत्तिः; i. e. when the recurring of the action takes place within a short time, it is अविप्रकृष्टकाल ॥ Thus बहुधा or बहुकृत्व दिवसस्य भुङ्क्ते \"he eats many times a day\". But when a remote time is denoted then धा does not apply. Thus बहुकृत्वो मासस्य भुङ्क्ते 'he eats many times in a month, not daily, owing to poverty &c.'",
    "54021": "The translation of the _sutra_ given above is according to the rendering of Prof. Bohtlingk. According to _Kasika_: तत् signifies that the word in construction to which the affix is to be added should be in the nominative case, (IV. 1. 82) the word प्रकृतम् means \"happening to be in abundance\". So that according to this interpretation the _sutra_ should be translated, as done by Dr. Ballantyne, \"The affix _mayat_ may be employed after a word denoting some substance, when we require an expression for it as abundant\". Thus अन्नं प्रकृतम् = अन्नमयम्  \"abundance of food\", अपूपमयम् \"abundance of cake\". According to others, that in which there is abundance of the thing signified by the word to which the affix मयट् is added, is denoted by the whole word. Thus अन्नं प्रकृतमस्मिन् = अन्नमयो यज्ञः \"a feast in which there is abundance of food\". अपूपमयं पर्व, वटकमयोयात्रा ॥ Both senses are possible, as the _sutra_ is constructed.\n\n\"The word वचन in the _sutra_ has two senses. It being made by the affix ल्युट् conveys the force both of the nature (III. 3. 114) and the site. In the former case, (taking, तत् प्रकृतवचन to mean \"the mention of that as abundant)\", we have अन्नमयम् \"abundance of grain\". But in the second case, (taking it to mean \"that in which something is spoken of as abundant)\" we have अन्नमयो यज्ञः \"sacrifice at which food is abundant\". (Dr. Ballantyne's _Laghukaumudi_).",
    "54022": "The च shows that मयट् also comes in the same sense. Thus मोदकाः प्रकृताः प्राचुर्येण प्रस्तुताः = मौदकिकम् (IV. 2. 47) or मोदकमयम्; so also शाष्कुलिकम् or शष्कुलीमयम् ॥ In the second sense we have, मोदकाः प्रकृताः अस्मिन् यज्ञे = मौदकिको or मोदकमयो यज्ञः, शष्कुलिकः or शाष्कुलीमयः ॥",
    "54023": "Thus आनन्त्यम् = अनन्तः, आवसथ्यम् = आवसथः 'dwelling place, a sanctuary for sacred fire'. ऐतिह्यम् = इति ह 'traditional account', the affix here is added to a word which is not a _pratipadika_. The word इति ह means tradition, as इति ह स्मोपाध्यायाः कथयन्ति ॥ भैषज्यम् = भैषजम् ॥\n\nIt is optional to add this affix, owing to the general optional nature of all _taddhita_ affixes. See (IV. 1. 82).",
    "54024": "The word तादर्थ्यम् has the same meaning as तदर्थ \"for the sake of that\" (II. 1. 37). Thus अग्निदेवतायै इदम् = अग्निदेवत्यम् \"offering &c, sacred to _Agni_\". So also पितृदेवत्यम्, वायुदेवत्यम् ॥",

So also अर्घ्यम् ॥ The accent of these words is governed by (VI. 1. 213), the _udatta_ being on the first syllable.\n\nThe च in the _sutra_ implies the inclusion of words other than पाद and अर्घ, not mentioned here. The affix यत् applies to other words also, as एष वै सप्तदशाक्षरश्छन्दस्यः प्रजापतिः । So also वसु, अयस्, ओक, कवि, क्षेम, उदक, वर्चस्, निष्केवल, उक्थ, जन, पूर्व, नव, सूर, मर्त, यविष्ठ ॥ These words take यत् in the Vedas.

The प्रज्ञ of this _sutra_ comes from the root प्रजानाति = प्रज्ञः \"he who knows fully\".\n\nThe word विदन् occurs in the list of प्रज्ञादि words. It is formed by the addition of the affix शतृ (III. 2. 124) to the root, as, विद् + शतृ = विदत् nom. s. विदन् ॥ The very fact that we have such a from विदन् shows that the substitution of वसु for शतृ after the word विद् taught in (VII. 1. 36) (by which we get विद्वान्) is an optional substitution, the word \"optionally\" being drawn in from _Sutra_ (VII. 1. 35).

The verb here is जन् 'to produce', and hence no affixing. Why have we used the words _sampadya_ _kartari_ 'the agent that has attained', for even without their use, the words _abhuta_-_tadbhava_ 'becoming what the thing previously was not', would imply that the attainment was of the agent? The use of _sampadya_-_kartari_ shows that the attainment spoken of here should be of the 'agent', and not of any other _karaka_, as, अदेवगृहे देवगृहे भवति 'becoming in the temple what was not before in the temple; such as a tree &c'. Here the _karaka_ is locative and not agent, and the becoming of what the thing previously was not refers to location and not to agency. Hence no affix is added here.",
    "54051": "The affix च्वि would have come after these words by force of the last _sutra_ which is of universal application : the present _sutra_ is made in order to teach the elision of the consonant. Thus अनरुररुः सम्पद्यते, तं करोति = अरू करोति, अरू भवति, अरू स्यात् ॥ So also उन्मनी करोति, भवति or स्यात्, so also उच्चक्षू, विचेती, विरही, and विरजी करोति or भवति or स्यात् ॥ The short उ of अरु and चक्षु is lengthened by (VII. 4. 26), and the अ of the other words is changed into ई by (VII. 4. 32).",
    "54052": "The whole phrase \"when the agent has attained to a state it previously had not and the verbs _kri_, _bhu_ and _asti_ are in conjunction\", is understood here. The affix साति is employed when the original is changed in its totality (कृत्स्न). Thus अग्निसाद् भवति शस्त्रम् \"the whole weapon is in a blaze-- has become fire\". We may also say अग्नी भवति शस्त्रम् ॥ So also उदकसाद् भवति लवणम् or उदकी भवति लवणम् \"The salt becomes all water\".\n\nWhy do we say \"in its totality\"? Observe एकदेशेन पटः शुक्ली भवति \"the cloth whitens in part\".\n\nThe word \"optionally\" shows that the affix _chvi_ also comes in the same sense. While the optional affixing of these terminations _chvi_, _sati_ &c is governed by the _Maha_-_vibhasha_ of _sutra_ (IV. 1. 82) (see (V. 3.1).",
    "54053": "The word अभिविधि means 'pervasion'. The force of the word च in the _sutra_ is that the same sense is expressed when the verbs कृ, भू and अस् are in construction as well. By drawing the _anuvritti_ of the word _vibhasha_ into this _sutra_, we may, in the alternative, employ the affix च्वि in the same sense of _abhividhi_: but then it must be followed by the verbs कृ, भू and अस् only and not by the verb संपद ॥\n\nThus अग्निसात् संपद्यते or अग्निसात् भवति; उदकसात् संपद्यते or भवति &c. Or उदकी भवति or अग्नी भवति ॥\n\nWhat is the difference between the words _abhividhi_ and _kartsnya_ of these two _sutras_? Where all things of similar origin get changed, though it be partially only, it is called _abhividhivikara_ As, अस्यां सेनायाम् उत्पातेन सर्वम् शस्त्रम् अग्निसात् सम्पद्यते; or वर्षासु सर्वम् लवनम् उदकसात् सम्पद्यते ॥ Here सर्व has the force of प्रकार कार्त्स्न्य, namely, all things belonging to the kind of weapons such as swords, lances and all things of the nature of salt, but not these things individually in its totality. While the word _kartsnya_ means that one thing in all its parts assumes the form of another thing. In short, the difference between these two words is this: when one object is changed in all its parts, it is _kartsnya_ change, when many objects are changed in some of their parts, it is _abhividhi_ change.",
    "54054": "The _anuvritti_ of अभूततद्भावे ceases here, as a different sense altogether is assigned to the affix. The _anuvritti_ of the four verbs _Kri_ &c, however, runs into the _sutra_. The word तदधीन means 'under the supremacy or control of that', 'under the proprietorship of that'. Proprietor in general and the object of rulership in general are indicated by the word _tadadhina_. Thus राजाधीनं करोति = राजसात् करोति \"he (a king) brings it (a kingdom) under his dominion\". Similarly राजसात् स्यात् or भवति or संपद्यते ॥ So also ब्राह्मणसाद् भवति, करोति, स्यात् or संपद्यते ॥",
    "54055": "The phrase \"dependent upon that\" is understood here also. The word देय qualifies the above phrase. When a thing which is known as a proper gift for the _Brahmanas_, is put under their control by offering it to them, then the affix _tra_ is employed. Thus ब्राह्मणाधीनं देयं करोति = ब्राह्मणत्रा or ब्राह्मणसात् करोति \"He gives it to the _Brahmanas_, as it is an object which ought to be given to them\". ब्राह्मणत्रा भवति \"it becomes given to the _Brahmans_\". So also with यात् and संपद्यते ॥ Why do we say \"when the sense is that of to be given\"? Observe राजसाद् भवति राष्ट्रम् ॥",
    "54056": "The _anuvritti_ of _sati_ ceases, that of _tra_ continues. The verbs _kri_, _bhu_ and _asti_ also have no scope here. This is a general _sutra_. Thus देवात् गच्छति = देवत्रा गच्छति, देवेषु वसति = देवत्रा वसति ॥ So also मनुष्यत्रा, पुरुषत्रा, पुरुत्रा, and मर्त्यत्रा ॥\n\nBy using the word 'diversely' in the aphorism it is intended that the affix comes in this sense after other words also; as बहुत्रा जीवतो मनः ॥",
    "54057": "The sound in which the letters अ आ &c are not distinctly expressed is called _avyakta_ 'unmanifest' or 'inarticulate'. The imitation of such a sound is called _avyakta_-_anukarana_. That whose half consists of at least two syllables is called _dvyajavarardha_, that is a polysyllabic word of four syllables or more when doubled, the smallest number of whose vowels are two, not less, when halved. The phrase \"when joined with _kri_, _bhu_ and _asti_\" is understood here. The affix comes after that word which when reduplicated is such that its half (_ardha_) is at least (_avara_) of two syllables (_dvyach_). When the affix डाच् is added there is reduplication of the word. That is first the word is reduplicated and then the affix is added. Thus पटत् is a sound imitation word. By reduplication it becomes पटपटत् (eg. पटत् + पटत् = पटप् पटत् the final त् of the first word is changed in to the form of the next letter प्, and then for two प one is substituted by (VI. 1. 100)). Thus पटपटत् करोति = पटपटा करोति \"he makes a sound like _patat_ _patat_\". So also with भवति and स्यात् ॥ So also दमदमा करोति, भवति or स्यात् ॥ The final अत् of पटपटत् is elided by (VI. 4. 143) before the affix डाच् having an indicatory ड्, the real affix being आ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is name of an imitative sound?\" Observe दृषत् करोति \"it makes or turns to stone\". Why do we say \"after that half which consists of at least two vowels\"? Observe श्रत् करोति 'he utters the exclamation _srat_'. Why do we say \"at least\"? Observe खरटखरटा करोति where the half consists of more than two syllables and the rule still applies. So also त्रपटत्रपटा करोति ॥ Why do we say \"when इति does not follow\"? Observe पटिति करोति (VI. 1. 98). The च् of डाच् is for the sake of accent, it prevents the circumflex (_swarita_) accent. Thus, पटपटा꣡ + अ꣡सि ॥ Here first the अ of असि which was _udatta_, becomes _anudatta_ by (VIII. I. 28). Then by (VIII. 2. 5), आ꣡ of टा and अ of असि coalesce into an _udatta_ आ꣡, as पटपटासि ॥ But then comes in rule (VIII. 2. 6) which would make this आ optionally _svarita_, the indicatory च् prevents it. Some read द्व्यजवरार्ध्यात्, the य however does not change the sense.",
    "54058": "The repetition of the word कृ in this _sutra_ indicates that the भू and अस्ति are not to be taken. Thus द्वितीया करोति = द्वितीयं कर्षे (= विलेखनं) करोति 'he makes the second ploughing of the field'. So also तृतीया करोति, शम्बा करोति 'he makes the field ploughed contrariwise to what it was ploughed before = अनुलोम कृषं क्षेत्रं पुनः प्रतिलोमं कृषति ॥ So also बाजी करोति = सहबीजेन विलेखनं करोति ॥\n\nWhy do we say when meaning \"to plough\" ? Observe द्वितीयं करोति पदम् ॥",
    "54059": "The word कृ is understood here. Thus द्विगुणा or त्रिगुणा करोति क्षेत्रम् \"he ploughs the field twice or thrice\" = द्विगुणं विलेखनं करोति क्षेत्रस्य ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning to plough\"? Observe द्विगुणां करोति रज्जुम् \"he doubles the rope\".",
    "54060": "The word कृ is understood here also. The _anuvritti_ of कृष ceases. The getting of leisure from the duties is called समय or 'time; the neglect or loss of such time is meant by the word यापना ॥ Thus समया करोति = कालक्षेपं करोति (अद्य मे पारवश्यं, श्वः परश्वो वास्य समय इत्येवं यो बहुषु दिवसेषु अतिवर्त्तते, स एवमुच्यते) 'who procrastinates'. Why do we say when the sense is that \"neglecting\"? Observe समयं करोति \"he makes time\".",
    "54061": "The word कृ is understood here also. The word _ati_-_vyathana_ means violent pain. Thus सपत्रा करोति मृगं व्याधः = सपत्रं शरमस्य शरीरे प्रवेशयति  \"the hunter pierces the stag with the arrow so violently that the feathered part of the arrow also enters the body\". So also निष्पत्रा करोति = शरीराच् छरमपरपार्श्वे निष्क्रामयति \"he pierces so voilently that the arrow entering one side comes out of the other with its feathers\". Why do we say when meaning \"to cause violent pain\"? Observe सपत्रं वृक्षं करोति जलसेचकः, निष्पत्रं वृक्षतलं करोति भूमिशोधकः ॥",
    "54062": "The verb कृ should be read into the _sutra_. The word निष्कोषण means to bring the inner organs out, or to eviscerate. Thus निष्कुल करोति पशून् \"he disembowels or guts the animals\". निष्कुला करोति दाडिमम् \"he takes out the kernel or seeds of the pomegranite\". Why do we say \"when meaning to disembowel or take out the kernel\"? Observe निष्कुलान् करोति शत्रून् \"he makes the enemies family-less\".",
    "54063": "The word आनुलोम्य means 'agreeability', 'to conform to the wishes of the object of adoration'. Thus सुखा करोति, प्रिया करोति स्वामिन् = स्वाम्यादेर्श्चित्तमाराधयति \"tries to please the heart of the master &c\". This affix comes when, while doing a pleasant or agreeable thing, the idea is to please another by such an act. Otherwise observe: सुखं करोति or प्रियं करोति औषधपानम् \"the drinking of medicines gives pleasure &c\".",
    "54064": "The verb कृ is understood and _pratilomya_ means 'to oppose' or \"to act against another's wishes\", \"to pain the heart of one's master &c\". As दुःखा करोति भृत्यः \"the servant pains the master\".\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning to go against the grain\"? Observe दुःखं करोति कदन्नम् ॥",
    "54065": "Thus शूले पचति = शूला करोति मांसम् \"he roasts the meat on a spit\". Why do we say \"when meaning to roast\" ? Observe शूलं करोति कदन्नम् \"the bad food causes colic\".",
    "54066": "The word सत्य means 'truth' as opposed to 'falsehood'. Sometimes it means to swear, as in the sentence \"सत्येन शापयेद् विप्रम्\" ॥ This latter sense is prohibited. Thus सत्या करोति वनिक् भाण्डम् \"the merchant concludes the bargain of the goods i. e. he settles that he will purchase these wares\". Why do we say 'when not meaning to swear'? Observe सत्यं करोति ब्राह्मणः \"the _Brahmana_ swears\".",
    "54067": "The word परिवापण means 'to shave' 'to raze'. The word मद्र means 'auspicious'. Thus मङ्गलं मुण्डनं करोति = मद्रा करोति ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the word भद्रा; as भद्रा करोति नापितं कुमारं  \"the barber shaves the hair of the boy on the auspicious occasion\".\n\nWhy do we say when meaning 'to shave'. Observe मद्रं or भद्रं करोति ॥",
    "54068": "This is an _adhikara_ or regulating _sutra_: and governs all _sutras_ upto the end of this chapter. All the affixes to be ordained here after become the final part and integral portion of a compound, so that whenever a compound is formed, these affixes must be added to complete the compound. These affixes are useful in forming the _Avyayibhava_, the _Dvigu_, the _Dvandva_, the _Tatpurusha_ and the _Bahu_-_vrihi_ compounds: in fact so long as these affixes are not added, the compounds do not get the designation of _Avyayibhava_ &c. Thus उप + राजन् = उपराजन् : now before this word can be properly called an _Avyayibhava_, we must elide the final अन् by adding the _samasanta_ affix डच् (V. 4. 108), and we get the form उपराज, to which अम् is added by (II. 4. 83) and we have उपराजम्, so also अधिराजं ॥ So also द्विपुरी, त्रिपुरी the _samasanta_ अ being added to पुर् by (V. 4. 74), then the feminine affix ङीप् by (IV. 1. 21), the whole word द्विपुर being called _Dvigu_. So also, कटकवलयिनी and शङ्खनूपुरिणी ॥ Here the affix इनि (V. 2. 128) is added to the whole, _samasanta_ word कटकवलय &c which gets the name of _Dvandva_. Similarly विधु꣡रः (विगतोधुरः), प्र꣡धुरः (प्रगतोधुरः). Here the whole _samasanta_ (V. 4. 74) word gets the name of _Tatpurusha_, and hence the first member retains its accent by (VI. 2. 2), namely _udatta_. (_phit_ IV. 12 and 13) उचैर्धुरः, नीच꣡र्धुरः being _Bahuvrihi_, the first member retains its accent, namely acute on the final, as उचैः, नीचैः have been taught as _antodatta_ in the very list of _Svaradi_ (l. 1. 37).\n\nAs a general rule all affixes come at the end of a word (II. 1. 2), what is the use of employing the word \"_anta_\" in this _sutra_? It means that when words like _avyayibhava_ &c are employed, they mean words having those affixes already at their end. Thus the _Dvigu_ compound of द्वि॑ + धुर = द्विधुर् + अ (V. 4. 74) = द्विधुरः so that when rule (IV. 1. 21) says that the feminine of _Dvigu_ compounds ending in अ take ई, it refers to _Dvigu_ compounds which have already taken the _samasanta_ affix अ, otherwise the rule (IV. 1. 21) would not have applied, for strictly speaking द्विधुर् ends in र् _r_ and not in  अ ॥ Similarly rule (V. 2. 128) ordaining इनि after _Dvandva_ compounds, means that the affix comes after a _Dvandva_ compound that has already taken the _samasanta_ affix टच् (V. 4. 106), as कोश + निषत् = कोश + निषद् + टच् (V. 4. 106) कोशनिषदं, कोशनिषदिनी ॥",
    "54069": "Later on will be mentioned certain words which when standing as member in a compound take these _samasanta_ affixes. The present rule prohibits the application of those affixes when such words are preceded by a word expressing praise. Thus (V. 4. 91) ordains the affix टच् when the words राजन् enters a compound, as, महा + राजन् = महा + राजन् + टच् = महाराजः, and not महाराजा ॥ But सुराजा, अतिराजा, so also सुगौः, अतिगौः (V. 4. 92) prohibited)).\n\nVart:- The word expressing praise must be सु or अति and not any word expressing praise in general. Therefore, the prohibition does not apply in परमराजः and परमगवः ॥\n\nVart:- This prohibition applies up to _sutra_ (V. 4. 113) exclusive. Thus सुसक्थः, अतिसक्थः, स्वक्षः, अत्यक्षः, here the affix पच् (V. 4. 113) is not prohibited.",
    "54070": "Thus किं + राजन् = किंराजन् as किंराजा यो न रक्षति \"He is no-king who does not protect\". किंसखा योऽभिद्रुह्यति, किंगौर्यो न वहति ॥ (V. 4. 91), (V. 4. 92), (II. I. 64). The compounding here takes place by Rule (II. I. 64).\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning reproach\"? Observe कस्य राजा = किंराज, किंसखः, किंगवः ॥",
    "54071": "Thus अराजा, असखा, अगौः (V. 4. 91) and (V. 4. 92) prohibited). Why do we say \"after a _Tatpurusha_ compound?\" The same words preceded by the negative particle will take the _samasanta_ affix when forming compounds other than _Tatpurusha_, as अणृचो मानवकः, अधुरं शकटम् ॥ (V. 4. 74) applied)).",
    "54072": "This declares an option, where under the last _sutra_ the omission would have been necessary. Thus अपथम् or अपन्थाः ॥ (See (V. 4. 74) and (II. 4. 30)).",
    "54073": "This _Bahuvrihi_ is formed by rule (II. 2. 25). Thus उपदशाः, उपविंशाः, उपत्रिंशाः, आसप्तदशाः, अदूरदशाः, अधिकदशाः, द्वित्राः, पंचधाः, पंचदशाः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting a numeral'? Observe चित्रगुः, शबलगुः ॥ Why do we say 'not after _bahu_ and _gana_'? Observe, उपबहवः, उपगणाः ॥ The difference here is in the accent for had डच् been added, it would have made the final of उपगण acute, but it not being so, the first member retains its accent, namely acute on the first.\n\nVart:- The _Tatpurusha_ compouds of numerals like निस्त्रिंश &c, take also the affix डच् ॥ Thus निर्गतानि त्रिंशतः = निस्त्रिंशानि वर्षाणि देवदत्तस्य '_Devadatta_ is more than thirty years old' ॥ निर्गतस्त्रिंशतांगुलिभ्य = निस्त्रिंशः खड्गः 'the sword is more than thirty fingers long'.",
    "54074": "The _anuvritti_ of the word _Bahuvrihi_ does not enter here. It applies to all compounds in general. The word अनक्षे qualifies धुर्, as it cannot qualify the words ऋक् &c.\n\nThus अनृचः बह्वृचः,अर्द्धर्चः, _pur_: as, ललाटपुरम्, नान्दीपुरम् ॥ _ap_ as, द्वीपम् = (द्विर्गता आपो यस्मिन्) = द्वि + अप् = द्वि + ईप् (VI. 3. 97) = द्वीपं, अन्तरीपम्, समीपम्  ॥ _dhur_ as, राजधुरा, महाधुरा ॥ _pathin_, as, जलपथः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not in conjunction with अक्ष?\" Observe, अक्षस्य धूः = अक्षधूः, दृढधूरक्षः ॥\n\nThe words अनृचः and बह्वृचः apply to students of _Rik_: thus अनृचः means \"a boy who has not read the _Rik_\". बह्वृचः \"a _Brahmana_ who has read many _Rig_ verses\". The affix अ is not applied when it refers to the Vedas, as अनृक साम, बह्वृक् सूक्तम् ॥",
    "54075": "As प्रतिसामम्, अनुसामम्, अवसामम् ॥ प्रतिलोमम्, अनुलोमम्, अवलोमम् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अच् comes after the word भूमि preceded by the words कृष्ण, उदक्, पाण्डु, and also after the words गोदावरी and नदी when preceded by a numeral. As, कृष्णभूमः पाण्डुभूमः, उदग्भूमः ॥ पञ्चनदम्, सप्तगोदावरम् (see (II. I. 20)).\n\nVart:- The affix अच् is added to भूमि when preceded by a numeral. As, द्विभूमः प्रासादः, त्रिभूमः &c, दशभूमकं सूत्रं ॥ This affix is added to words other than those mentioned above: as पद्मनाभः, ऊर्णनाभः, समरात्रः, दीर्घरात्रः, अरात्रः ॥ Here the affix अच् is added to नाभि and रात्रि ॥ All this can be done by dividing the above _sutra_ into two parts viz. (1) अच् (2) प्रत्यन्व &c. That is अच् comes after all compounds and (2) after सामन् and लोमन् preceded by प्रति &c.",
    "54076": "The word अच् is understood here. Thus लवणाक्षम्, पुष्कराक्षम् ॥ These are _Tatpurusha_ metaphors formed by (II. I. 56).\n\nWhy do we say \"when not meaning the eye\"? Observe ब्राह्मणाक्षि ॥ How do you explain the forms कबराक्षः, गवाक्षः, which apparently contradict this rule, because कबराक्ष is a many-holed leather horse-veil through which the horses can see, and so also गवाक्ष is a window through which men see? This is no fault. The word दर्शन in the _sutra_ does not mean 'to see', here, but is a synonym of 'eye'.",
    "54077": "The first three of these words are _Bahuvrihi_: अचतुरः = अदृश्यान्यविद्यमानानि वा चत्वारि यस्य 'that whose four are absent or non-existent'. विचतुरः = विगतानि चत्वारि यस्य \"whose four are gone\". सुचतुरः = शोभनानि चत्वारि यस्य \"whose four are good\".\n\nThe next eleven words are _Dvandva_ compounds. They are clear. Thus स्त्री च पुमांश्च = स्त्रीपुंसौ 'the man and woman' but not here स्त्रियाः पुमान् (स्त्रियं प्रति पुमान् शूरः) = स्त्रीपुमान् \"a brave towards women only\". धेनुश्च अनड्वांश्च = धेन्वनडुहौ \"cow and bull\". ऋक् च साम च = ऋक्सामे \"the _Rik_ and the _Saman_\". वाक् च मनश्च = वाङ्मनसे \"the speech and mind\". अक्षि च भ्रुवौ च = अक्षिभ्रुवम् \"the eye the brow\". The compound is singular as being parts of members of human body, (II. 4. 2). दाराश्च गावश्च = दारगवम् \"the wives and cows\". रात्रि च दिवा च = रात्रिंदिवम् ॥ ऊरू + अष्ठीवन्तौ + अच् = ऊर्वष्ठीवम् ॥ Here the final syllable (called टि) is elided : so also पादौ + अष्टीवन्तौ = पद् + अष्टीव् + अच् = पदष्ठीवम् ॥ नक्तं च दिवा च = नक्तंदिवं 'by night and day'. These are two indeclinables having the force of locative, and this compoundirg is also irregular. The words अहर् and दिवा both mean 'day': the compound अहर्दिवम् is not, however, a superfluous compound of two synonyms. It is used here in a distributive sense = अहन्यहनि \"day by day\". The word सरजसम् is an _Avyayibhava_, meaning 'all', as सरजसमभ्यवहरति ॥ The affix does not come when it is a _Bahuvrihi_: as सह + रजसा = सरजः पङ्कजम् ॥ The word निःश्रेयसं = निश्चितं श्रेयः and is a _Tatpurusha_: but not so in निश्रेयस्कः पुरुषः ॥ Then is the word पुरुषायुषम् a Genitive _Tatpurusha_ = पुरुषस्यायुः ॥ Not so when it is a _Dvandva_, as पुरुषश्च आयुश्च = पुरुषायुषी ॥ The words द्व्यायुषम् and त्र्यायुषम् are _Samahara_ _Dvigu_ compounds. Therefore not here, द्वयोरायुः = द्व्यायुः, त्र्यायुः ॥ The word ऋग्यजुषम् is a _Dvandva_. Therefore not here ऋग्यजुस्योन्मुग्धस्य = ऋग्यजुरुन्मुग्धः (य ऋचोयजूंषि मन्यते) ॥ The three words ending in उक्ष are _Karmadharaya_. Not so when these are _Bahuvrihi_: as जातोक्षा ब्राह्मणाः &c. The word उपशुनम् is an _Avyayibhava_ = शुनः समीपम् ॥ Here the non-elision of the final syllable, and the change of व of श्वन् into उ (_samprasarana_) are irregular. The word गोष्ठश्वः is a Locative _Tatpurusha_, as गोष्ठेऽश्वाः = गोष्ठश्वः ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अच् comes after चतुर् when preceded by त्रि and उप, as त्रिचतुराः, उपचतुराः ॥",
    "54078": "Thus ब्रह्मवर्च्चसम्, हस्तिवर्च्चसम् ॥ _Varchas_ means 'light', 'strength'.\n\nVart:- So also when _Varchas_ is preceded by the words _pallya_ and _rajan_ : as, पल्ल्यवर्च्चसम्, राजवर्च्चसम् ॥",
    "54079": "Thus अवतमसम्, सन्तमसम्, अन्धतमसम् ॥",
    "54080": "Thus श्वोवसीयसम्, श्वःश्रेयसम् ॥ These compounds belong to the class of _Mayuravyansakadi_ (II. 1. 72) The word श्वः is usually employed in blessing or praising the object expressed by the second term. Thus श्वः श्रेयसम् ते भूयात् = शोभनं श्रेयस्ते भूयात् ॥ The word श्वोवसीयसम् is a synonym of श्वः श्रेयसम् ॥ The word वसीयः is derived from वसु meaning \"praiseworthy\", \"rich\", by adding the affix ईयसुन् (V. 3. 57).",
    "54081": "Thus अनुरहसम्, अवरहसम्, तप्तरहसम् ॥",
    "54082": "Thus प्रत्युरसम् = उरसि वर्त्तते ॥ This is an _Avyayibhava_ compound, the indeclinable having the force of a _vibhakti_ (II. 1. 6).\n\nWhy do we say \"when having the sense of the locative?\" Observe प्रत्युरः = प्रतिगतमुरः ॥",
    "54083": "Thus अनुगवं यानं \"the chariot suited to the length of the oxen\". This compound is formed by (II. 1. 16). Why do we say when meaning \"the length\"? Observe, गवां पश्चाद् = अनुगु ॥",
    "54084": "The affix अच् is added and the final syllable i. e. टि is elided. Thus द्विस्तावा वेदिः \"an altar twice as big as an ordinary one\".  त्रिस्तावा वेदिः \"thrice as big as an altar\". The words are compounds of द्विः and त्रिः plus तावत् meaning \"as much\". Why do we say \"when applied to an altar\"? Observe द्विस्तावती रज्जुः, त्रिस्तावती रज्जुः ॥",
    "54085": "Thus प्रगतोऽध्वानं = प्राध्वो रथः, प्राध्वम् शकटं, निरध्वम्, प्रत्यध्वम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when preceded by an _Upasarga_\"? Observe परमाध्वा, उत्तमाध्वा ॥",
    "54086": "Thus द्वे अंगुलो प्रमाणमस्य = द्व्यंगुलम्, त्र्यंगुलम् ॥ This compounding takes place by (II. 1. 51).

See (V. 2. 37) _Vart_.)). So also when an Indeclinable precedes it: as निर्गामंगुलिभ्यो = निरंगुलम्, अत्यंगुलिः पुरुषः ॥ Why do we say when a _Tatpurusha_ compound? Observe पंचांगुलिः, अत्यंगुलिः पुरुषः ॥ The word \"_Tatpurusha_\" is understood in all the subsequent _sutras_ up to (V. 4. 106).",
    "54087": "The _anuvritti_ of संख्याव्ययादेः is drawn in to this _sutra_ by force of the word च् \"and\" of the _sutra_. The word अहन् forms a _Dvandva_ compound as अहश्च रात्रिश्च = अहोरात्रः \"day and night\". So also सर्वरात्रः, पूर्वरात्रः 'the first part of night' : अपररात्रः 'the latter part of night'. These are formed by (II. 2. 1). So also संख्याता रात्रिः = संख्यातरात्रः ॥ This compound is formed by (II. 1. 57). So also पुण्या रात्रिः = पुण्यरात्रः । So also when compounded with a Numeral or an Indeclinable : as, द्वे रात्री समाहृते = द्विरात्रः, त्रिरात्रः, अतिक्रान्तो रात्रिम् = अतिरात्रः, नोरात्रः ॥",
    "54088": "When the affix टच् follows अहन्, and the latter is preceded by the words सर्व &c, then अह्न is substituted for अहन् ॥ By the term एतेभ्यः \"these words\", is meant the numerals (with the exception of एक (V. 4. 90)) the Indeclinables, the words सर्व, संख्यात and words denoting a part of a day, for these are the words mentioned in the last _sutra_. The word अहन् is also mentioned therein, but it is not taken here, for there can be no _Tatpurusha_ compound of अहन् with अहन् ॥ The word पुण्य is also excluded by (V. 4. 90). Thus द्वयोरह्नोर्भवः = द्व्यह्नः, त्र्यह्नः, अहरतिक्रान्तः = अत्यह्नः, निरह्नः ॥ So also सर्वाह्णः, (VIII. 4. 7), पूर्वाह्णः, अपराह्णः, संख्याताह्नः (according to some संख्याताहः (V. 4. 90)).\n\nThe ordaining of substitution is redundant according to the _Vartika_ _kara_. In his opinion, the _sutra_ अह्नः एतेभ्यः alone would have been enough. The meaning then would have been \"the affix अच् comes after the word अहन् when preceded by these words सर्व &c\". The adding of अच् would produce the same result: as द्वि + अहन् + अच् = द्वि + अह्न् + अच् (VI. 4. 134) the middle अ of अहन् is elided)) = द्व्यह्नः ॥ The only specific result which टच् would have produced was to make the feminine of these words end in long ई (IV. 1. 15), and the elision of the final अन् of अह्न (VI. 4. 145). But the compounds of अहन् are masculine always (II. 4. 29), they can have no feminine: and as the desired form is द्व्यह्नः, the _sutra_ (VI. 4. 145) cannot apply. The affix अच् is therefore, the proper affix and the substitution of अह्न for अहन् is redundant.",
    "54089": "This substitution is prohibited in the case of _Samahara_-_Tatpurusha_. Thus द्वे अहनी समाहृते = द्व्यहः, so also त्र्यहः ॥ Here rule (V. 4.9) applies.\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning a collective noun?\" Observe द्वयोरह्नोर्भवो = द्व्यह्नः, त्र्यह्नः ॥ This is a _Taddhitartha_ _Dvigu_ compound formed by (II 1. 51); the affix अण् denoting तत्र भवः (IV. 3. 53) is elided by (IV. 1. 88): and the final अन् of अहन् is elided by (VI. 1. 145).",
    "54090": "The word उत्तम means 'last'; and refers to पुण्य which is the last word in (V. 4. 87). The word उत्तम 'last' is used instead of पुण्य as a वैचित्र ॥ Thus पुण्याहः, एकाहः ॥ Some include the penultimate word संख्यात also in the prohibition. According to them संख्याताहः is the proper form and not संख्याताह्नः ॥",
    "54091": "Thus महाराजः, मद्रराजः, परमाहः, उत्तमाहः (VI. 4. 145) राज्ञः सखा = राजसखः ॥ ब्राह्मणसखः ॥ Why not so here मद्राणां राज्ञी = मद्रराज्ञी  instead of मद्रराजी ? For according to the maxim \"a _pratipadika_ denotes, whenever it is employed in Grammar, also such a nominal stem as is derived from it by the addition of an affix denoting gender\" (प्रातिपदिकग्रहणं लिङ्गविशिष्टस्यापि ग्रहणम्); the stem राजन् would denote the feminine also. To this we reply, that the construction of the _sutra_ shows that the feminine राज्ञी is not to be taken. Because अहन् being a prosodially lighter word than राजन् ought to have been placed first in the compound. Its not being so placed indicates that that form राजन् only is to be taken whose final vowel becomes lengthened into आ in compounding with अहन्, i.e. राजा + अहन् ; and not राज्ञी + अहन् ॥",
    "54092": "Thus परमगवः, उत्तमगवः, पंचगवम्, दशगवम् ॥ Why do we say \"when no _Taddhita_ affix has been elided in forming the compound?\" Observe, पंचभिर्गोभिः क्रीतः = पंचगुः (Here the affix ठक् (V. 1. 37) is elided by (V. 1. 28) and hence the _samasanta_ affix टच् is not added). So also दशगुः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when a _Taddhita_ is elided\"? The prohibition does not apply when a सुप् affix is elided : as राजगवमिच्छति = राजगवीयति (III. 1. 8) and (II. 4. 71).\n\nWhy do we say 'when there is elision' ? Merely adding a _Taddhita_ affix in forming a _Tatpurusha_, will not debar the _samasanta_ affix: as पंचभ्यो गोभ्य आगतं = पंचगो + टच् + रुप्य (the _tach_ is added by this _sutra_, and the _taddhita_ रुप्य to denote तत आगतः by (IV. 3. 81)) = पंचगवरुप्यम्, पंचगवमयम्, दशगवरुप्यम् दशगवमयम् ॥",
    "54093": "The word अग्र means 'the principal': as the word उरस् is the principal member of an animal, so by metonomy it has come to mean 'the principal'. Thus अश्वानां उरः = अश्वोरसम् so also हस्त्युरसम् \"the most excellent of horses or elephants\".\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning the most excellent\". Observe देवदत्तस्योरः = देवदत्तोरः \"the breast of _Devadatta_\".",
    "54094": "Thus उपानसम्, अमृताश्मः, कालायसम्, and मण्डूकसरसम् are examples of जाति words, while महानसम्, पिण्डाश्मः, लोहितायसम्, and जलसरसम् are examples of संज्ञा ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when meaning a _jati_ or a _sanjna_ ?\" Observe, सदनः, सदश्माः, सत्सरः ॥",
    "54095": "The _anuvritti_ of _jati_ and _sanjna_ does not run into this _sutra_. Thus, ग्रामस्य तक्षा = ग्रामतक्षः, बहूनां साधारणः 'the public carpenter of all'. कुट्यां भवः = कौटः; कौटस्य तक्षा = कौटतक्षः meaning स्वतन्त्रः कर्मजीवी, न कस्यचित्प्रातिबद्धः 'and independent artisan, not particularly bound under engagement to any one'.",
    "54096": "Thus अतिक्रान्त श्वानम् = अतिश्वो वराहः \"the boar that surpasses the dog\" i.e. जववान् \"very swift\". So अतिश्वो सेवकः \"the dog-surpassing servant i. e. more devoted to his master than a dog\". So also अतिश्वी सेवा \"service worse than that of a dog\" = अतिनीचासेवा ॥",
    "54097": "Thus आकर्षः श्वेव = आकर्षश्वः 'a dog-like bow'. फलकश्वः \"a dog-like blade\". This compounding takes place by (II. 1. 56).\n\nWhy do we say \"when something is likened to it\"? Observe न श्वा = अश्वा लोष्टः \"a clod of earth which is not a dog\". This is not a very happy counter-example of _Kasika_ : for in the case of नञ् _Tatpurusha_ compound there is express prohibition taught in (V. 4. 71). The proper example should be निःश्वालोष्टः ॥ Why do we say \"when the thing compared is not a living being\" ? Observe वानरः श्वेव = वानरश्वा \"a dog-like monkey\".",
    "54098": "By the force of the word च in the _sutra_, we read in the word उपमानात् also. Thus उत्तरसक्थम्, मृगसक्थम्, पूर्वसक्थम् ॥ So also in फलकमिव सक्थि = फलकसक्थम् ॥",
    "54099": "Thus द्वे नावौ समाहृते = द्विनावम्, so also त्रिनावम् ॥ Thus द्विनावधनम्, पंचनावप्रियः are also formed. So also द्वाभ्यां नौभ्यामागतं = द्विनावरूप्यम्, द्विनावमयम् (IV. 3. 31).\n\nWhy do we say 'when in a _Dvigu_ compound'? Observe राजनौः \"the king's ship\". The phrase अतद्धितलुकि \"when a _Taddhita_ affix is not elided\" of _sutra_ (V. 4. 92) applies here also. Therefore टच् does not apply in पंचभिर्नौभिः क्रीतः = पंचनौः, दशनौः ॥",
    "54100": "Thus अर्द्धं नावः = अर्द्धनावम् ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 2. 2). The compound is of neuter gender, and does not take the gender of the term as required by (II. 4. 26): for gender is regulated by usage more than any grammatical rules (लोकाश्रयत्वं लिङ्गस्य) ॥",
    "54101": "The words द्विगोः and अर्द्धात् are both understood here. Thus द्वे खार्यौ समाहृते = द्विखारम् or द्विखारि ॥ So also अर्धं खार्या = अर्धखारम् or अर्धखारी ॥ According to _Padamanjari_ this _sutra_ could be dispensed with: as खार is synonymous with, खारी, as द्विखारं, त्रिखारं ॥ And it will be govered by the _Vartika_ ठन्येभ्योऽपि दृश्यते खार शताद्यर्थम् under (V. 1. 57) and (V. 1. 58), in _Mahabhashya_.",
    "54102": "Thus द्वावञ्जली समाहृतौ = द्व्यञ्जलम्, so also त्र्यञ्जलम् ॥ The word द्विगोः is understood here also, so that when the compound is not a _Dvigu_, the rule does not apply. Thus द्वयोरञ्जलिः = द्वञ्जलिः ॥ The phrase \"when a _Taddhita_ is not elided (V. 4. 92)\" is understood here also. Therefore the affix टाच् does not apply here : द्वाभ्यामंजलिभ्यां क्रीतः = द्व्यञ्जलिः ॥ So also त्र्यञ्जलिः (V. 1. 28.) The phrase \"according to the opinion of the Eastern Grammarians\" (V. 4. 101) is to be read into this _sutra_. Thus in the alternative we have द्व्यञ्जलिप्रियः ॥",

Thus सुराष्ट्रेषु ब्रह्मा = सुराष्ट्रब्रह्मः, and अवन्तिब्रह्मः \"a _Brahmana_ of _Surashtra_ or _Avanti_\".

Now by rule (VI. 2. 198) the second term '_saktha_' has optionally _udatta_ accent, on this final in a _Bahuvrihi_. When therefore, it is not oxytone, then by adding ङीप् the final of दीर्घसक्थी would have been _anudatta_, so that the feminine in one case would be oxytone, in the other not, which would be anomalous.

The prohibition of _punvad_-_bhava_--the change of feminine into masculine ordained by (VI. 3. 24) -- applies also to the Ordinal when it is _pradhana_. Therefore, the affix is not added here. कल्याणपंचमीकः पक्षः = कल्याणी पंचमी अस्मिन् पक्षे ॥\n\nVart:- The affix अप् comes after नेतृ when preceded by a word denoting asterism.

    "61001": "Upto _Sutra_ (VI. 1. 12) inclusive it is to be understood that for the first syllable two are to be made, i. e. the first syllable is to be reduplicated. This is an adhikara _sutra_ : all the three words viz, एकाचः, and द्वे and प्रथमस्य are to be read in the subsequent _sutras_ upto (VI. 1. 12), before the rule of _Samprasarana_ begins. Thus _Sutra_ (VI. 1. 8) says \"when लिट् follows, of an unreduplicated verbal root\". The sense of this _sutra_ is incomplete, unless we supply the three words of this _sutra_, when it will read thus : \"when लिट् follows, there are two in the room of the first portion, containing a single vowel of an unreduplicated verbal root\". Thus from जागृः-जजागार (जागृ + णल् (IV. 3. 82) = जा + जागृ + अ = ज + जागर् + अ (VII. 4. 59) = जजागार \"lie awoke\"). So also पपाच्, इयाय, आर from the roots पच्, इ and ॠ ॥ The reduplication takes place through the force of the affix that follows. Thus the affixes of the Perfect Tense (लिट्), the Desiderative (सन्), the Intensive (यङ्), the श्लु _vikarana_, the Aorist in चङ्; all cause reduplication.\n\nThe word एकाच means that which consists of one vowel (अच्) ॥ When a stem or root consists of more than one vowel (is a dissyllabic or polysyllabic root), then the एकाच् प्रथमः will be the first syllable: as in जागृ the portion आ is the प्रथम एकाच् 'the first portion consisting of one vowel'. When a root consists of a single vowel, as इ 'to go', then strictly speaking there cannot be any portion which may be called first (प्रथम) or _ekach_ consisting of a single vowel). Here, however, will this rule be applied and इ will be reduplicated, according to the maxim \"व्यपदेशिवदेकस्मिन्\" - \"An operation which affects something on account of some special designation which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach\". So also in पच् there is no first syllable strictly speaking, but still the rule will apply under the above maxim. In making Reduplications the Rule (I. 1. 59) should always be borne in mind. Thus पच् + अ (णल् of लिट्) = पाच् पाच् + अ = प पाच् + अ (VII. 4. 59) and (VII. 4. 60) = पपाच ॥\n\nThe word द्वि in the _sutra_ indicates that the very word-form is to be doubled or pronounced-twice, and not that another word of similar meaning is substituted. In fact this is not a rule ordaining substitution of two, in the room of one; but of the repetition of the one. Compare (VIII. 1. 1).",
    "61002": "This debars the reduplication of the first syllable. In a verbal root beginning with a vowel, and consisting of more than one syllable, the second syllable is to be reduplicated and not the first. Thus the सनन्त root अटिष, (अट् + सन् = अट् + इट् + सन् (VII. 2. 35) = अटिष), reduplicates the second syllable टिष् and the 3rd per. sing is अटि टिषति, the ष् being elided by (VII. 4. 60): and स changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 59). So also अशिशिषति, अरिरिषति ॥ The last form is thus evolved, ॠ + सन् = ऋ + इट् + सन् (VII. 2. 74) = अर + इ + स (VII. 3. 84), and (VI. 1. 51). Here now we have to make reduplication, and if (I. 1. 59) be applied, then since a vowel affix इ follows, the reduplication of अर should take place i. e. the ॠ the _sthani_ should be reduplicated. But we have explained the _sutra_ द्विर्वचनेऽचि (I. 1. 59), by the phrase द्विर्वचननिमित्तेऽचि, i. e. the vowel-affix causing reduplication. Here the vowel-affix इट् does not cause reduplication, but the consonant-affix सन् that does so. Therefore rule (I. 1. 59) does not apply, for इट् itself is a कार्यी, and the maxim applies कार्यमनुभवन्हि कार्यी निमित्ततया नाश्रीयते \"surely that which undergoes an operation can, so for as it undergoes that operation, not be made the cause of the application of a grammatical rule\". Thus from the root शीङ् is formed शयिता; here the root शी is gunated before the augment इट्. Rule (I. 1. 5) declaring the prohibition of gunation with regard to कित् or ङित् words does not apply here. For though शीङ् has an indicatory ङ, yet as it undergoes an operation itself, it cannot be the cause of the application of another rule.\n\nSome persons explain the word अजादेः as the Ablative singular (and not Genitive Singular) of अजादिः and they consider the word as a _Karmadharaya_ compound and not a _Bahuvrihi_ compound. According to them the word means:-\"The syllable following the initial vowel is reduplicated\". (अच्चासावादिश्वेत्यजादिः, अजादेरुत्तरस्य एकाचो द्वे भवतः) ॥ According to this interpretation, the word द्वितीयस्य is merely explanatory.",
    "61003": "The word _dvitiyasya_ \"of the second syllable\", is understood here. This _sutra_ debars the doubling of the consonants _n_, _d_, and _r_ when forming parts of the second syllable, provided these letters occur in the beginning of a conjunct (_sanyoga_) letter. Thus the Desiderative root of उन्द is उन्दिष, formed by adding सन् and इट् ॥ The second syllable here is न्दिष् which is to be reduplicated by the last rule. But in doing so, न् will not be doubled. Thus we get the form उन्दिदिषति; so also from अड्ड् and अर्च् we have अड्डिडिषति, and अर्चिचिषति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when न्, द् and र् are the letters\"? Observe ईचिक्षिषते from ईक्ष् in which क् is the initial letter and has been reduplicated in to च् ॥ Why do we say \"being the first letter in a conjunct consonant\"? Observe प्राणिणिषति from the root अन् 'to breathe', the न् being changed into ण् by (VIII. 4. 19) and (VIII. 4. 21). The phrase अजादेः of the last _sutra_ is understood in this _sutra_ also. Thus दरिद्रासति ॥ Some explain the word अजादेः understood in this _sutra_ in the same way as in the last, namely as a _karmadharaya_ compound in the Ablative singular. They do so, in order to explain the form इन्दिद्रीयिषति, which is thus evolved इन्द्रमिच्छति = इन्द्र + क्यच् (III. 1. 8) = इन्द्रीय ॥ Then इन्द्रीयितुमिच्छति = इन्द्रीय + सन् ॥ Here though the second syllable consists of _n_, _d_ and _r_, yet न् alone is rejected in reduplication and not द and र also, as द and र are not immediately after the initial vowel (अजादि) इ in this case.\n\nVart:- This prohibition should be stated with regard to the letter ब् also. As उब्ज् – उब्जिजिषति ॥ This prohibition applies when the word is taught primarily as having a penultimate ब् ॥ But when it is taught as primarily having a penultmate द, then the rule does not apply: the ब should then be ordained as a substitute of द ॥ See _Tudadi_ root 20.\n\nVart:-There is no prohibition of the र when it is followed by य ॥ Thus अरार्यते ॥ This is the Intensive form of the verb ॠ, and is thus evolved: ॠ + यङ् (III. 1. 22. Vart) = अर् + य (VII. 4. 30) = अर्य, then follows reduplication by the rules of this _sutra_. The second syllable र्य has an initial र which is not however rejected in reduplication.\n\nVart:- In the case of the verb ईर्ष्यति the third should be reduplicated. \"Third of what\"? Some say the third of the consonants, and according to them the form is ईर्ष्यियिषति ॥ Some say the third syllable, therefore of the root ईर्ष्यिष (ईर्ष्य + इट् + सन्), the third syllable ष is reduplicated: Thus ईर्ष्यिषष, ईर्ष्यिषिष (VII. 4. 79) the अ of ष is changed into short इ by (VII. 4. 79) = ईर्ष्यिषिषति ॥\n\nVart:- The third syllable of the verbs कण्डूय &c. is to be reduplicated. Thus कण्डूय + इट् + सन् = कण्डूयिष = कण्डूयियिषति; so also असूयियिषति &c.\n\nVart:- The third syllable of verbs derived from nouns is optionally reduplicated. Thus अश्वीयियिषति or अशिश्वीयिषति ॥\n\nVart:- Others say, any syllable of a नामधातु (verbs derived from nouns) may be reduplicated. Thus from the noun पुत्र is derived the root पुत्रीय, the desiderative root of which is पुत्रीयिष, which requires reduplication. Here any syllable may be reduplicated; as. 1, पुपुत्रीयिषति, 2, पुतित्रीयिषति, 3. पुत्रीयियिषति, 4, पुत्रीयिषिषति ॥ Or there may be double and treble reduplication simultaneously as. पुपुतित्रीयियिषति ॥",
    "61004": "The word द्वे in the nominative case is understood here, but for the purposes of this _sutra_ it is taken in the Genitive case i. e. द्वयोर्यः पूर्वः \"the first of the two\" ordained above. The word _Abhyasa_ occurs in _sutras_ (III. 1. 6), (VI. 1. 7) &c.",
    "61005": "Though the word द्वे was understood in the _sutra_, the use of the word उभे 'both' indicates that the word _Abhyasta_ applies to the two taken together and not to any one of them separately. The word _abhyasta_ occurs in _sutras_ (III. 4. 109), (VI. 1. 32) &c. Thus _sutra_ (VI. 1. 189) declares \"the first vowel of an _Abhyasta_ gets the _udatta_ accent\". The _Abhyasta_ being the collective name of the both, the accent will fall on the first and not on the second, as in ददति _dadati_, the accent is on the first अ ॥ So also by (VII. 1. 4) अत् takes the place of झ after an _Abhyasta_, therefore, दद + झि = दद + अति = ददति ॥ So also ददत् (VI. 4. 112).",
    "61006": "The word _abhyasta_ is understood here. The verb _jakshi_ and the six verbs that follow it in the _Dhatupatha_, in all seven verbs, get this designation. These are जक्ष, जागृ, दरिद्रा, चकास्, शास्, देधी, and वेवी । _Panini_ has overlooked वेवी and mentions only the first six. By getting the designation of _Abhyasta_ these verbs get acute accent on the first syllable when followed by a _sarvadhatuka_ Tense-affix not having the intermediate इट् and beginning with a vowel. Thus जा꣡ग्रति _ja_-_grati_, ज꣡क्षति _jakshati_, द꣡रिद्रति _daridrati_, चका꣡सति _chakasati_, शा꣡शति _sasati_, दी꣡ध्यते _didhyate_, and वे꣡व्यते _vevyate_. The present participle दीध्यत् is irregularly formed by adding the affix शतृ (अत्) and when so formed it does not take the augment नुम् by (VII. I. 78).",
    "61007": "There is no list of तुजादि verbs given any where. The word आदि in तुजादि therefore should be construed as \"verbs like _tuj_\". So that wherever we may find a word having a long vowel in the Reduplicate, we should consider it a valid form. Thus तूतुजानः (तुज् + कानच् (III. 2. 106) = तूतुजानः _Rig_. I. 3. 6). मामहानः, अनड्वान् दाधार, स्वधां मीमाय, स तूताव ॥ This lengthening only takes place in the Vedas before some special affixes, and not every where or in secular literature. As तुतोज शबलान् हरीन् ॥",
    "61008": "The reduplication is either of the first syllable or of the second syllable according as the root begins with a consonant or a vowel. Thus पच् + णल् = पच् पच् + णल् = पपाच ॥ So also पपाठ, प्रोर्ण्णुनाव ॥ In the case of ऊर्णु, Rule (III. 1. 36) does not apply, so the Perfect of this word is not formed by adding आम् and the auxiliary verbs कृ, भू and अस्; but regularly. In fact ऊर्णु is regarded as if it was नु ॥ See _sutra_ (III. 1. 36) _Vartika_. वाच्य ऊर्णोर्णुवद् भावो यङ् प्रसिद्धिः प्रयोजनं, आमश्च प्रतिषेधार्थमेकाचश्चेडुपग्रहात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say when लिट् follows? Observe कर्त्ता, हर्त्ता ॥ Why do we say \"of a _Dhatu_\"? Observe ससृवांसो विशृण्विरे, सोममिन्द्रायसुन्विरे ॥ The question arises from the fact that the root (_dhatu_) always directly precedes the affixes of the Perfect, no _vikarana_ intervenes as in the case of other tenses. So there was no necessity of using the word _dhatu_ in the _sutra_. To this it is replied that by (III. 4. 117), sometimes लिट् is treated as _sarvadhatuka_, and then it takes _vikarana_. As श्रु taking the _vikarana_ श्नु becomes शृणु; (III. 1. 74) this whole base is not a _dhatu_, therefore when the affixes of Perfect are added there is no reduplication, and we have शृन्विरे ॥ See (III. 4. 117).\n\nWhy do we say 'of a non-reduplicate'? Observe कृष्णो नोनाव वृषभो यदीदम् । नोनूयतेर्नोनाव, i.e. it is the Perfect Tense of the Intensive verb नोनूय, and is not reduplicated again, यङ् having already caused reduplication. So also संमान्या मरुतः समिमिक्षुः ending in the उस् of the Perfect.\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_ there is optionally reduplication of the root in the Perfect and other tenses. As आदित्यान् याचिषामहे or यियाचिषामहे; देवतानो दाति प्रियाणि or ददाति प्रियाणि ॥ मघवा दातु or ददातु, नस्तुतो वीरवद् धातु or दधातु ॥\n\nVart:- The root जागृ is optionally reduplicated in the Perfect. As, यो जागार (or जजागार) तमृचः कामयन्ते ॥",
    "61009": "The word सन् यङोः should be construed as genitive dual and not as Locative dual. In the latter case, the meaning would be \"when the affixes सन् and यङ् follow, a non-reduplicate root is reduplicated\". The difficulty would be that while the root alone would be reduplicated. the augment इट् would not, as in अटिटिषति, अशिशिषति ॥\n\nThe phrase धातोरनभ्यासस्य is understood here also. The reduplication is of the first or second syllable, according as the root has an initial consonant or vowel. Thus पच् + सन् (III. 1. 7.) पक्ष, reduplicate पिपक्षति (VII. 4. 79). So पत् पिपतिषति, ॠ – अरिरिषति, उन्द – उन्दिदिषति ॥ So also of यङन्तः - as, पापच्यते (VII. 4. 83), अटाट्यते, यायज्यते, अरार्यते, प्रोर्ण्णोनूयते ॥ If a root is already a reduplicated one, there is no reduplication : as जुगुप्सषते, लोलूयिषते being the Desiderative forms of जुगुप्स (already formed by _svarthika_ सन् (III. 1. 5), and of लोलूय (the Intensive form of लु) ॥ See (III. I. 22).",
    "61010": "The श्लु is the characteristic sign of the roots of the third class, and causes the elision of the _vikarana_ शप् ॥ The reduplication is of the first or second syllable, according as the root has an initial consonant or a vowel. Thus जुहोति (from हु), बिभेति, जिह्रेति ॥",
    "61011": "The reduplication is of the first or second syllable according as the root begins with a consonant or a vowel. Thus अपीपचत्, अपीपठत्, (VII. 4. 93) and (VII. 4. 94). So also आटिटत्, आशिशत्, आर्दिदत् ॥ These are aorists of the causative roots पाचि &c.\n\nWhen the Reduplicated Aorist of the Causative (ण्यन्त) verbs पच् &c is to be formed, as here, we should first elide the causative sign णि, then shorten the penultimate vowel, and then reduplicate. Then by (VII. 4. 93) the effect would be like as if सन् had followed, and this would not be prohibited by the short vowel being considered _sthanivat_. For rule (VII. 4. 93) says \"Let the effect be as if सन् had followed, on the reduplicate, if followed by a light vowel, of an inflective base to which णि followed by चङ् is affixed; provided there is not the elision of any letter in the _pratyahara_ अक् occasioned by the affixing of णि ॥\" One of the conditions for the application of this rule is that the reduplicate must be followed by a light vowel. We have said above that the long penultimate is to be shortened before चङ् ॥ Now arises the difficulty. Should this light vowel coming in the room of a heavy vowel be considered like the heavy vowel by the rule of _sthanivat_ _adesa_ (I. 1. 56), or not? It should not be considered so, for the reasons given in (I. 1. 57). For it was established there that the _sthanivadbhava_ will arise then only when some operation is to be done to a thing anterior to the non-substituted i. e. original vowel. Here no operation is to be applied to something anterior to such original (अनादिष्ट) vowel, but to a form consisting of such substituted (आदिष्ट) vowel. Therefore, the light vowel is not considered non-existent for the purposes of सन्वद्भाव ॥ If this order of operation is not followed, there would arise incongruities. The order must be this: Ist the elision of णि ( VI. 4. 51) 2nd the shortening of the penultimate (VII. 4. 4) 3rd the reduplication. If the reduplication take place first and the vowel be shortened, then the reduplication having taken place before the substitution of the vowel had taken place, such substitute will now be considered as _sthanivad_: the light vowel being considered as still heavy, will prevent the application of सन्वद्भाव ॥ The difficulty will be in the form of आशीशमत्, where the short is ordained after the णि ॥ If this be the order of operations, there will not be the reduplication of the second syllable टि in the word अटिटत् ? This is, however, done by (I. 1. 59). which see.",
    "61012": "The word दाश्वान् is from the root दाशृ 'to give' with the affix क्वसु (III. 2. 107), here the reduplication and the augment इट् are prohibited irregularly. As दाश्वांसो दाशुषः सुतम् (_Rig_ I. 3. 7). The word साह्वान् is derived from the root सह् 'to endure', by adding the affix क्वसु (III. 2. 107), the irregularity being in lengthening the penultimate, not allowing the augment इट् and the reduplication. Thus साह्वान् बलाहकः ॥ So also मीढ्वान् comes from मिढ् 'to sprinkle' with the affix क्वसु (III. 2. 107) the irregularity consisting in non-reduplication, non-application of इट्, the lenghthening of the penultimate vowel, and the change of ह into ड ॥ As मीड्वस्तोकाय तनयाय मृडय ॥ It is not necessary that these words should be in the singular always, in their plural forms also they do not reduplicate.\n\nVart:- Reduplication takes place when कृञ् &c, are followed by the affix क ॥ Thus क्रियते अनेन = कृ + क = चक्रम्, क्लिद् + क = चिक्लिदम् ॥ The affix क comes after कृञ् and क्लिद् with the force of the affix घञ् ॥\n\nVart:- The roots चर्, चल्, पत्, and वद् take reduplication when followed by the affix अच् (III. 1. 134) and the reduplicate (_abhyasa_) takes the augment आक् ॥ The final consonants of the _Abhyasa_ (reduplicate) are not elided in these verbs, in order to give scope to the augment, for if the final consonants be elided by (VII. 4. 60), then the addition of the augment becomes unnecessary; as there is no difference between the augment and the _adesa_ (shortening of the vowel) taught in (VII. 4. 59). Thus चराचरः, चलाचल, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥\n\nVart:- The above _vartika_ is optional, so we have the forms चरः पुरुषः, चलो रथः, वदो मनुष्यः &c.\n\nVart:- The root हन् is reduplicated before the affix अच्, and the augment आक् comes after the _Abhyasa_, and घ is the substitute of ह of the _Abhyasa_. Thus हन् + अच् = घन् + आक् + हन् + अच् = घनाघनः (The second ह is changed into घ by (VII. 3. 55)), as in the phrase घनाघनः क्षोभनश्चर्षणीनाम् ॥\n\nVart:- The causative root पाटि is reduplicated before the affix अच्, there is elision of णि (sign of the causative), and उक् is the augment of the _Abhyasa_, and it is lengthened. Thus पाटि + च् = पाटूपटः ॥",
    "61013": "When the words पुत्र and पति are the second members; forming a _Tatpurusha_ compound, there is _samprasarana_ (vocalising the semi-vowels) of the affix ष्यङ् of the preceding. That is य् is changed into इ ॥ Thus करीषस्येव गन्धोऽस्य = करीषगन्धिः (a _Bahuvrihi_ compound taking the _samasanta_ affix or rather substitute इ by (V. 4.137) करीषगन्धैरपत्यम् = करीषगन्धि + अण् (IV. 1. 92) = करीषगन्धः ॥ The feminine of this will be formed by adding ष्यङ् (IV. 1. 78). Thus we have कारीषगन्ध्या (see (IV. 1.78)). Now in forming the _Tatpurusha_ compound of this word with पुत्र or पति, the final य् will be changed into इ and we have कारीषगन्धीपुत्रः, कारीषगन्धीपतिः ॥ The आ of या becomes merged into इ (VI. 1. 108), and the short इ is lengthened (VI. 3. 139). So also कौमुदगन्धीपुत्रः or कौमुदगन्धीपतिः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"of the affix ष्यङ्\"? Observe इभ्यापुत्रः, क्षत्रियापुत्रः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when followed by पुत्र or पति\"? Observe कारीषगन्ध्याकुलम्, कौमुदगन्ध्याकुलम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when forming a _Tatpurusha_ compound\"? Observe कारीषगन्ध्यापतिरस्य ग्रामस्य = कारीषगन्ध्यापतिरयं ग्रामः ॥ It is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound.\n\nThe affix ष्यङ् is here the feminine affix य followed by चाप् (आ) (see (IV. 1. 77) and (IV. 1. 74).\n\nA general maxim relating to all affixes is \"an affix denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added, and ends with the affix itself: प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहितस्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम्\"॥ This maxim, however, does not apply in case of feminine affixes, where we have this rule \"a feminine affix denotes whenever it is employed in a rule, a word-form which ends with that affix, but which need not necessarily begin with that to which the affix has been added, but where the word form is subordinate: \"स्त्रीप्रत्यये चानुपसर्जने न\"॥ Thus we have परमकारीषगन्ध्यायाः पुत्रः =  परमकारीषगन्धीपुत्रः and so also परमकारीषगन्धीपतिः ॥ Not so when the word is an _upasarjana_ or subordinate in a compound. As अतिक्रान्ता कारीषगन्ध्याम् = अतिकारीषगन्ध्या, तस्य पुत्रः = अतिकारीषगन्ध्यापुत्रः, अतिकारीषगन्ध्यापतिः ॥\n\nThis vocalisation takes place when पुत्र and पति alone, not compounded with any other word, stand at the end : not so when a word beginning or ending with these words follows. Thus कारीषगन्ध्यापुत्रकुलं, कारीषगन्ध्यापरमपुत्रः &c.\n\nThough a word ending in ष्यङ् may have many semi-vowels, yet the vocalisation takes place of the affix य (ष्यङ्) only, according to the maxim निर्दिश्यमानस्यादेशा भवन्ति \"substitutes take the place of that which is actually enunciated\".\n\nThe word संप्रसारण has regulating influence upto (VI. 1. 44) inclusive. The rules of vocalisation (change of semi-vowels into vowels) is contained in these _sutras_.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated when पति and पुत्र follow the word गौकाक्ष्य ॥ As गौकाक्ष्यापुत्रः, गौकाक्ष्यायातः instead of गौकाक्षीपुत्रः &c.",
    "61014": "Thus कारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुरस्य = कारीषगन्धीबन्धुः ॥ So also कौमुदगन्धीबन्धुः ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when the compound is a _Bahuvrihi_\"? Observe कारीषगन्ध्याया बन्धुः = कारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुः, which is a _Tatpurusha_ compound. Like the last _sutra_, we have here also परमकारीषगन्धबन्धुः, but अतिकारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुः, कारीषगन्ध्याबन्धुधनः, कारीषगन्ध्यापरमबन्धुः ॥\n\nThough the word बन्धुनि is exhibited in the _sutra_ in the neuter gender, it is in fact a masculine word.\n\nVart:- There is vocalisation of ष्यङ् in a _Bahuvrihi_ compound with मातच्, मातृक and मातृ optionally: as कारीषगन्धीमातः꣡ or कारीषगन्ध्यामातः꣡, कारीषगन्धीमातृकः or कारीषगन्ध्यामातृकः, कारीषगन्धीमाता, कारीषगन्ध्यामाता ॥ The indicatory च of मातच् makes the word take the _udatta_ on the last syllable (VI. 1. 163), thus debarring the especial accent of the _Bahuvrihi_ (VI. 2. I). All _Bahuvrihi_ compounds ending in ऋ take the _samasanta_ affix कप्, so मातृ would have become मातृक by force of (V. 4. 153), so the separate enumeration of मातृ and मातृक here shows that कप् is also optional.",
    "61015": "The _anuvritti_ of ष्यङ् does not run into this _sutra_. The root वच includes the वच परिभाषने of the _Adadi_ class (II. 54) and the वच् substitute of ब्रू (II. 4. 53) स्वप् is the root ञिष्वप् शये of the _Adadi_ class (II 59). The यजादि verbs are the last nine roots of the _Bhvadi_ class viz. यज्, वप्, वह, वस्, वेञ्, ष्येञ्, ह्वेञ्, वद् and श्वि ॥ The semivowels of these eleven verbs are changed into the corresponding vowel, when an affix having an indicatory क is added to them. Thus with the Past Participle affixes क्त and क्तवतु third we have the following forms:- वच् -उक्तः, उक्तवान् , (VIII. 2. 30). 2 स्वप् - सुप्तः, सुप्तवान् 3 यज् - इष्टः, इष्टवान्. (VIII. 2. 36) 4 वप् -उप्तः, उप्तवान्, 5 वह् - ऊढः, ऊढवान् (VIII. 2. 31), (VIII. 2. 40), (VIII. 3. 13) and (VI. 3. 111) 6 वस् - ऊषितः ऊषितवान्, (VII. 2. 56) (VIII. 3. 60) 7 वेञ् - उतः, उतवान्, 8 व्येञ् - संवीतः, संवीतवान्, 9 ह्वेञ् - हूतः, हूतवान्, 10 वद् - उदितः, उदितवान् , 11 दुओश्वि - शूनः, शूनवान् ॥\n\nधातो स्वरुपग्रहणे तत्प्रत्यय कार्ये विज्ञायतेः- When in a Grammatical rule, an operation (dependant on an affix) is taught with regard to a root (_dhatu_) by mentioning particular verbs (_dhatu_) specifically, and not by using the word \"_dhatu_\", generally, then the operation takes place only when the root is followed by such an affix as can be added to roots by emunciating the word धातोः ॥ The existence of this maxim is inferred in the formation of the word भ्रौणहत्यम् in (VI. 4. 174), which see. Therefore, there is no vocalisation of वच् in the following वाच्यति, वाचिकः ॥ Here वाच्यति is formed by adding क्यच् to वाच् (वाचमिच्छति)॥ वाच् is formed by क्विप् added to वच्, the vowel being lengthened and _samprasarana_ being expressly prevented by _Unadi_ II. 57. Now, it is a general rule that a root taking the affix क्विप्, विट्, or विच् does not lose its character of a _dhatu_. Therefore वाच् is a root (धातु), and it ought to take vocalisation before the affix क्यच् ॥ But क्यच् is not enunciated to come after a _dhatu_, but after a सुबन्त (सुपआत्मनः क्यच् (III. I. 8)) in the rule ordaining its affixing. So also वाचिकः formed by adding ठक् to वाच् (See _Vartika_ V. 3. 83).",
    "61016": "By force of the word 'च' 'and', the _anuvritti_ of किति is read into this _sutra_. Thus 1. ग्रह – गृहीतः, गृहीतवान् (by क्त and क्तवतु), गृह्णाति (1. 2. 4), जरीगृह्यते (by यङ of the Intensive). 2. ज्या - जीनः, जीनवान् (VIII. 2. 44) त changed to न), जिनाति (1. 2. 4), the short इ is lengthened by (VI. 4. 2) and is shortened again by (VII. 3. 80). जेजीयते (यङ्), 3. वयि - The root वेञ् is replaced by वय when लिट् follows (II. 4. 41). This वयि can have no ङित् affix after it, it takes only लिट् terminations, which as we know are कित् (I. 2. 5). The examples, therefore given will be of कित् affixes only. Thus ऊयतुः, ऊयतुः ॥ Now arises this question 'why do you enumerate वयि, for is not वेञ् (for which वयि is substituted) already included in यजादि class of verbs given in the last _sutra_, and by force of that _sutra_, वयि will get _samprasarana_ before कित् affixes\". The reply is \"वयि is numerated here in order to show that the prohibition of _samprasarana_ with regard to वेञ् as taught in (VI. 1. 40), does not apply to its substitute वयि in the Perfect Tense\". Thus while the Perfect of वेञ् is ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः, the Perfect of its substitute वयि is ऊवाय, ऊयतुः and ऊयुः ॥ More over (VI. I. 38) teaches that the य of वय is not vocalised in लिट् affixes, which therefore, implies _jnapaka_) that the other semivowel i. e. व of वय will be vocalised. 4. व्यध - विद्धः, विद्धवान्, and with ङित् affixes विध्यति, वेविध्यते ॥ 5. वश - उशितः, उशितवान्, and with ङित् affixes उष्टः, उशन्ति ॥ 6. व्यचः - विचितः, विचितवान् विचति, वेविच्यते ॥ By a _Vartika_ under (I. 2. 1), the word व्यच is considered to belong to कुटादि class, and therefore all affixes after it, other than those having an indicatory ण्, ञ् or the affix अस्, are considered as ङित्, and therefore, there will be _samprasarana_ before these affixes : as, उद्विचिता, उद्विचितुम्, उद्विचितव्यम् ॥ 7. वृश्च – वृकणः, वृकणवान् ॥ How is the final च् of व्रश्च changed into क्, for by (VIII. 2. 36) च ought to have been changed into ष before the झलादि affix क्त ? To this we reply the affix क्त is replaced by न (VII. 2. 42) and as this न is not a झलादि affix, Rule (VIII. 2. 36) does not apply. This is done on the following maxim: \"The substitute of the _Nishtha_ should be considered to be _siddha_ or effective when applying the rules relating to the change of a letter into ष, to accent, to affix, and to the addition of the augment इट्\". But when च is to be changed into क, the substitute is considered _asiddha_ (not to have taken place). Thus we have the forms वृकणः &c. Before ङित् affixes we have वृश्चति, वरीवृश्च्यते ॥ 8. प्रच्छ - पृष्टः (VIII. 2. 36), पृष्टवान्, ङित् -पृच्छति, परीपृच्छ्यते ॥ The forms पप्रच्छ and बभ्रञ्ज would have been evolved by the simple rules of Reduplication even, without the application of this rule. But प्रच्छ+ नङ् (III. 3. 90) प्रश्नः ॥ Here there is no vocalisation, because _Panini_ himself uses the word प्रश्नः in _sutra_ (III. 2. 117) showing that this is the proper form though irregular. 9. भ्रस्ज - भृष्टः (VII. 2. 36), भृष्टवान्, ङित् – भृञ्जति, बरीभृञ्ज्यते ॥ The स of भ्रस्ज is changed first into द by झलां जश् झशि (VIII. 4. 53), and then द is changed into ज by स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः (VIII. 4. 40).",
    "61017": "Thus वच – उवाच, उवचिथ, स्वप् – सुष्वाप, सुष्वपिथ, यज – इयाज, इयजिय, टुवप् – उवाप्, उवपिथ ॥ As regards ग्रहादि verbs; ग्रह – जग्राह, जग्रहिथ (there is no speciality in case of this verb, as these forms would have been evolved without even this rule). ज्या – जिज्यौ, जिज्यथ, वयि – उवाय, and उवयिथ; व्यध – विव्याध, विव्यधिथ, वश – उवाश, उवशिथ, व्यच् – विव्याच, विव्यचिथ, व्रश्च – वव्रश्च and वव्रश्चिथ ॥ Some say that with regard to व्रश्च, it is equal whether there existed this present rule or not. For they argue thus, व्रश्च + णल् = व्रश् + व्रश्च् + अ = व + व्रश्च् + अ (हलादि शेषः (VII. 4. 60)) = वव्रश्च ॥ To this we reply, this form would be evolved no doubt had this rule not existed. But when this rule is applied, and you make reduplication without first vocalising the र, then you will have to vocalise व by force of this rule. Hence the necessity of this rule with regard to व्रश्च also, for having changed र into ॠ, we have वृव्रश्च् and then change ॠ into अ by (VII. 4. 66). Then this अ substitute becomes _sthanivat_ to ॠ (I. 1. 59), and therefore there is no vocalisation of this व, for rule (VI. 1. 37), prevents the vocalisation of a letter standing before one which has already been vocalised. There is no speciality with regards to प्रच्छ and भ्रस्ज verbs.\n\nThis vocalisation of the reduplicate is taught with regard to those affixes which are not कित् ॥ With regard to कित् affixes, the Rule (VI. 1. 15) will apply. And as the rule of vocalisation is subsequent to that of reduplication in order, therefore by the maxim of परत्व (I. 4. 2), vocalisation will take place first and then reduplication, according to the maxim पुनः प्रसङ्ग विज्ञानात्सिद्धम् \"occasionally the formation of a particular form is accounted for by the fact that a preceding rule is allowed to apply again, after it had previously been superseded by a subsequent rule\". Thus वच् + अतुः (which is कित् (I. 2. 5)) = उच् + अतुः = उच् + उच् + अतुः = ऊचतुः, ऊचुः ॥\n\nThough the phrase उभयेषाम् could have been supplied into this _sutra_ by the context and the governing scope of the preceding _sutras_, its express mention in this _sutra_ is for the sake of indicating, that the rule of vocalisation supersedes even the rule of हलादिः शेषः (VII. 4. 60), the vocalisation must take place at all events. Thus व्यध + णल् = व्य + व्यध + अ ॥ Here by (VII. 4. 60), the second consonant य of व्य ought to have been elided, and the equation would have stood व + व्यध् + अ, and there would have been vocalisation of व by this rule. But that is not intended; there is vocalisation of य and we have विव्याध ॥ In fact, the universal maxim of vocalisation is :-\"The _samprasarana_ and the operations dependent on it possess greater force than other operations which are simultaneously applicable\". संप्रसारणं तदाश्रयं च कार्यम् बलवत् ॥",
    "61018": "Thus the Aorist of स्वपि is असूषुपत्, असूषुपताम्, असूषुपन् ॥ The vocalisation takes place before reduplication, then there is _guna_ of the penultimate short vowel, then this is again shortened by (VII. 4. 1), then there is reduplication, and then lengthening of the vowel of the reduplicate by (VII. 4. 94). Thus स्वापि + चङ् = सुपि + चङ् = सुप् (VI. 4. 51) + चङ् (VII. 3. 86) = सोप् + चङ् = सुप् + चङ् (VII. 4. 1) = सु + सुप् + चङ् (VI. 1. 11) = सूषुपत् (VII. 4. 94) which with the augment अ becomes असूषुपत् ॥  \n\nWhy do we say 'when चङ् follows'?

Thus कि + यङ् = चि + कि + य = चे + कि + य = चे + की + य (VII. 4. 25) causing the lengthening of the short इ). But then the _Nishtha_ would have been चेकितः which is wrong.",

Thus प्रसंस्तीतः, प्रसंस्तीतवान् ॥  The compound प्रपूर्वस्य should be explained as a _Bahuvrihi_= प्रः पूर्वो यस्य धातूपसर्गसमुदायस्य स प्रपूर्व (that which consisting of root and _upasarga_ is preceded by प्र is called प्रपूर्व).

But when the sense is that of 'cold', the त is not changed; as शीतं वर्त्तते, शीतो वायुः, शीतमुदकम् ॥ The word शीत is here used both as a noun meaning 'cold weather &c', and an adjective denoting 'cold'.

When the sense is that of Reflexive, or Causative, there the form शृत is to be used. As शृतं क्षीरं स्वयमेव, शृतं क्षीरं देवदत्तेन ॥",
    "61028": "The root ओप्यायी वृद्धौ belongs to _Bhvadi_ class. The indicatory आ shows that the affixes त and तवत् are changed into न and नवत् (VIII. 2. 45). Thus पीनं मुखम्, पीनौ बाहू, पीनसुरः ॥ The option here is also a regulated option (_vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_). The substitution takes place invariably when the root is without _upasarga_, and never when it is preceded by an _upasarga_. Thus प्रप्यानः आप्यानश्चन्द्रगाः ॥ The substitution, however, must take place when the preposition आङ् precedes the root, and the words अन्धुः and ऊधस् are in composition : as आपीनोन्धुः, आपीनमूधः ॥",
    "61029": "The _anuvritti_ of the word विभाषा ceases. The phrase प्यायः पी of the last _sutra_ is drawn into this by force of the word च  'and'; thus आपिप्ये, आपिप्याते, आपिप्यिरे ॥\n\nThe substitution of पी a subsequent rule, would have debarred reduplication which precedes it in order. The reduplication, however, takes place after the substitution, by force of the maxim of पुनः प्रसङ्ग &c mentioned in (VI. 1. 17). Thus पी + लिट् = पि + पी + त = पि + प्य + ए (VI. 4. 82) the य being substituted) = आपिप्ये with the affix आ. So also in the Intensive, as, आपेपीयते, आपेपीयेते, आपेपीयन्ते ॥",
    "61030": "The phrases लिड् यङोः and सम्प्रसारणं are to be read Into this _sutra_. Thus शुशावे or शिश्वाय, शुशुवतुः or शिश्वियतुः ॥ So also in the Intensive as शीशृयते or शश्वीयते ॥ The root श्वि would not have taken vocalisation before यङ् by any previous rule, this _sutra_ teaches optional vocalisation. The root would have taken vocalisation before लिट्, which is a कित् affix, invariably by (VI. 1. 15), this _sutra_ modifies that by making the substitution optional. In the alternative, when the root does become vocalised, the reduplicate is also not vocalised in spite of (VI. 1. 17). This explains the form शिश्वाय, which by (VI. 1. 17) would have been शुश्वाय ॥ श्वि + णल् = (श् उद्व + णल् (VI. 1. 30)) = शु + णल् (VI. 1. 108) = शु + शु + अ (VI. 1. 8) = शुशाव ॥",
    "61031": "The phrase विभाषा श्वेः is understood here. In forming the Desiderative and the Reduplicated Aorist forms of the Causative of श्वि, there is optional vocalisation. Thus शुशावयिषति or शिश्वाययिषति ॥ So also in the Reduplicated Aorist चङ्, as अशृशवत् or अशिश्वयत् ॥ By the maxim संप्रसारणं संप्रसारणाश्रयं च बलीयो भवति (see _sutra_ (VI. 1. 17)), the _antaranga_ substitution of _Vriddhi_ &c is superseded by the _samprasarana_ and the subsidiary operations relating to it here. The _vriddhi_ and the substitution of आव take place after the _samprasarana_ has taken place. The _sutra_ (VII. 4. 80) teaching the substitution of ई for the उ of the reduplicate, when सन् follows, shows by implication that the substitution caused by णि is _sthanivat_ though it itself does not cause reduplication (I. 1. 59). Thus श्वि + णि = श्वै + इ = श्वाय् + इ = श्वायि ॥ In reduplicating श्वायि we cannot form श्वाश्वाय, but must consider the substitute equal to the original इ of श्वि and must reduplicate it. We thus get शिश्वाययिषति ॥ In the case of vocalisation, the rules of _Vriddhi_ &c are postponed. Thus श्वि + णि + सन् (VI. I. 108) = शु + णि + सन् = शौ + इ + सन् = शाव् + इ + इट् + सन् = शावे + इट् + सन् = शावयि + सन् ॥ Here we require reduplication. Here the substitute आव् in शाव् though not caused by सन्, is treated _sthanivat_ under (I. 1. 59) to उ, which is carried in reduplication. Similarly the Aorist. श्वि + णि + चङ् = शु + इ + अ = शु + शु + इ + अ = शु + शौ + इ + अ = शु + शाव् + इ + अ = शु + शव् + इ + अ (VII. 4. 1) = शु + शव् + ० + अ (VI. 4. 51) = अशूशवत् (VII. 4. 94)",
    "61032": "The whole of the last _sutra_ is to be read into this _sutra_. Thus जुहावयिषति and जुहावयिषतः; जुहावयिषन्ति; अजूहवत्, अजूहवताम् and अजूहवन् ॥ The root ह्वा does not take the augment य required by (VII. 3. 37) before the affix णि, because the _Samprasarana_ rule is stronger. The repetition of the word संप्रसारण in this _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ was present, indicates that the force of the word विभाषा has ceased. Though this and the next _sutra_ could well have been made one, their separation shows that the _samprasarana_ does not take place when another affix, not causing reduplication, intervenes. As ह्वायकमिच्छति = ह्वायकीयति; the Desiderative of this verb is जिह्वायकीयिषति ॥",
    "61033": "The _abhyasta_ means the reduplicate and the reduplicated, both the syllables. The vocalisation takes place before reduplication. Thus जुहाव, जोहूयते, and जुहुषति ॥ This and the last _sutra_ are one, in the original of _Panini_, they have been divided into two by the authority of a _Vartika_.",
    "61034": "Thus हुवे or ह्वयामि, as इन्द्राग्नी हुवे 'Invoke _Indra_ and _Agni_'. देवीं सरस्वतीं हुवे ॥ The form हुवे is _Atmanepada_, Present tense, Ist Person singular the _vikarana_ शप् is elided, then there is vocalisation and substitution of उवङ् ॥ So also ह्वयामि मरुतः शिवान्, ह्वयामि विश्वान् देवान् ॥ So also हवः as श्रुधीहवम् (_Rig_ I. 2. 1.) 'hear the invocation'.",
    "61035": "Thus विधुना निचिक्युः, नान्यं  चिक्युर्न निचिक्युरन्यम् ॥ These are forms ending in the affix उस् of the Perfect. Sometimes there is no substitution. As अग्निर्ज्योतिर्निचाय्यः ॥",
    "61036": "The word छन्दसि is understood here. From the root स्पर्द्ध 'to challenge', is formed अपस्पृधेथाम् being the Imperfect (लङ्), 2nd Person Dual, _Atmanepada_ : there is reduplication of the root, vocalisation of र्, and the elision of अ irregularly. As, इन्द्रश्च विष्णो यदपस्पृधेथाम् ॥ In secular language the form is अस्पर्धेथाम् ॥ Some say, it is derived from स्पर्द्ध with the preposition अप, the vocalisation of र, the elision of अ, and the non-prefixing of the augment अट् in the Imperfect (VI. 4. 75). The counter-example of this will be अपास्पर्द्धेथाम् ॥ From अर्च and अर्ह 'to respect, to worship', are derived आनृचुः and आनृहुः in the Perfect before the 3rd person plural उस्, there being vocalisation of र and the elision of अ irregularly. Then there is reduplication, then ॠ changed to अ, then the lengthening of this अ, then the addition of the augment म, as : अर्च् + उस् = ॠच् + उस् = ॠ + ॠच् + उस् + अ + ॠच् + उस् (VII. 4. 66) = आ + ॠच् + उस् (VII. 4. 70) = आ + न् + ॠच् + उस् (VII. 4. 71) = आनृचुः ॥ The irregularity consists in the _samprasarana_ with the elision of अ ॥ Thus यवग्रा अर्कमानृचुः, न वसून्यानृहुः ॥ The secular forms will be अनर्चुः, आनर्हुः ॥ The form चिच्युषे is the Perfect 2nd person singular of the root च्युङ् 'to go': there is vocalisation of the reduplicate, and the non-addition of the augment इट् before the affix से ॥ This is the irregularity. The regular form is चुच्युविषे ॥ The form तित्याज is the Perfect of त्यज्, the vocalisation of the reduplicate is the irregularity. The regular form is तत्याज ॥ From the root श्रीञ् 'to cook', is derived श्राता before the _Nishtha_ affix, श्री changed to श्रा irregularly. As श्रातास्त इन्द्रसोमाः ॥ The form श्रितं is also derived from the same root by shortening the vowel with the same affix. As सोमो गौरी अधिश्रितः, श्रिता नो गृहाः ॥ Some say the श्रा substitution of श्री takes place when the word refers to सोम, in the plural, and श्रि when it refers to other than सोम ॥ Sometimes the word श्रातः is seen in the singular, referring to objects other than सोम । Thus यदि श्रातो जुहोतन ॥ In fact, the exhibition of the word श्राताः in the plural in the _sutra_ is not absolutely necessary. The words आशीर् and आशीर्त्तः are from the same root श्री, with the prefix आङ् and taking the affixes क्विप् and क्त respectively. Before these श्री is replaced by शीर्, and the non-addition of न in the _Nishtha_ is irregular. As, तामाशीरा दुहन्ति आशीर्त्त ऊर्ज्जम्, क्षीरैर्मध्यत आशीर्त्तः ॥",
    "61037": "Thus व्यध्; has two semi-vowels व् and य्; when य् is once vocalised into इ, the preceding व will not be vocalised into उ ॥ Thus we have विद्धः ॥ From व्यच् – विचितः, व्येञ् – संवीतः ॥ Though the rule of vocalisation does not specify what particular semivowel is to be vocalised, yet according to the maxim that the operation is to be performed on the letter nearest to the operator, the second semivowel in the above cases is vocalised and the first is not, by force of this rule. Had the first semi-vowel been vocalised, then there would be no scope for this _sutra_, because then no semi-vowel will be found preceding a vocalised letter. This _sutra_ is a _jnapaka_ that the vocalisation commences with the second of the conjunct semi-vowels.\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of संप्रसारण was understood here, the repetition of this word shows that the prohibition of double vocalisation in the same word applies even when the semivowels are not contiguous. Thus by (VI. 1. 133) there is vocalisation of the word युवन्, the व being changed to उ, the य is not changed as यूना ॥ It might be objected that when the उ of यु, and उ the _samprasarana_ of व coalesce into one by _sandhi_ rules, then there being the substitution of one long ऊ for the two उ’s and this is _sthanivat_ to the original, the य  and व् of युवन् should be considered in fact as contiguous and not separated by an intervening letter, and therefore, the explanation given above does not hold good; we reply. The substitution of one long vowel for two vowels, is not considered _sthanivat_ (See (l. 1.58)). Even though it be considered as _sthanivat_, it is still a separating letter.\n\nVart:- There is vocalisation of the semivowel of त्रि when followed by ऋच्, and there is elision of the ऋ of ऋच्, when it refers to Metres. As तिस्र ॠचो यस्मिन् = तृचं सुक्तं ॥ तृचं साम ॥ The word तृच् takes the _samasanta_ affix अ by (V. 4. 74). Why do we say when referring to a metre? Observe त्यृचं कर्म ॥\n\nVart:- In the _Chhandas_ there is diversely vocalisation of the semi-vowel of रयि followed by the affix मतुप् as रयि + मत् = रइ + मत् = र + इ + मत् = र + इ + वत् (VIII. 2. 15) = रवेत्; as, आ रेवानेतु नो विशः ॥ Sometimes it does not take place, as रयिमान् पुष्टिवर्द्धनः ॥ The म here is not changed to व as required by (VIII. 2. 15).\n\nVart:- There is vocalisation of कक्ष्या before मत् when a Name is meant: as कक्षीवन्तं य औशिजः ॥ This _Vartika_ is unnecessary. See (VIII. 2. 12) where the form कक्षीवत् is given.",
    "61038": "The phrase न संप्रसारणं is understood here. Thus उवाय, ऊयतुः, ऊयुः ॥ The word लिट् is employed in this aphorism for the sake of subsequent _sutras_, this one could have done well without it even.",
    "61039": "Thus ऊयतुः or ऊवतुः, ऊवुः or ऊयुः ॥ According to _Patanjali_, the phrase वश्चास्य of this _sutra_ could have been dispensed with; this much would have been enough:- अन्यतरस्या किति वेञः ॥ Thus वे + अतुम् = वा + वा + अतुस् = ववतुः and ववुः (the vocalisation being prohibited). In the alternative:-वा + अतुस् = उ +अतुस् = उ + उवङ् + अतुस् (VI. 1. 77) = ऊवतुः, ऊवुः ॥ Here there is vocalisation. In the case of वय् substitute, the य is never vocalised, so we have ऊयतुः, ऊयुः ॥ Thus all the three forms have been evolved without using वश्चास्य ॥",
    "61040": "Thus ववौ, ववतुः, ववुः ॥ This root belongs to यजादि class and would have been vocalised before कित् affixes by (VI. 1. 15); and before non-कित् affixes the Reduplicate syllable of the Perfect would have been vocalised by (VI. 1. 17). Both vocalisations are prohibited here.",
    "61041": "Thus प्रवाय, उपवाय ॥ The separation of this _sutra_ from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_, into which the _anuvritti_ of ल्यप् only runs.",
    "61042": "Thus प्रज्याय, उपज्याय ॥",
    "61043": "As प्रव्याय, उपव्याय ॥ The separation of this _sutra_ from the last, is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, in which the _anuvritti_ व्ये runs.",
    "61044": "Thus परिवीय यूपम् or परिव्याय ॥ The augment तुक् presented by (VI. I. 71) is debarred by (VI. 4. 2.) which causes the lengthening of the vowel: since (VI. 4. 2) is subsequent to (VI. 1. 71).",
    "61045": "The word धातोः is to be read into this _sutra_ from (VI. 1. 8). Thus ग्लौग्लाता, ग्लातुम्, ग्लातव्यम्, शौ - निशाता, निशातुम्, निशातव्यम् ॥ Why do we say ending with an एच् (diphthong)? Observe कर्त्ता from कृ, and हर्त्ता from हृ ॥ Why do we say in _upadesa_ or _Dhatupatha_ ? Observe चेता, स्तोता where चे and स्तो are not the forms taught in the first enunciation of the root in the _Dhatupatha_, but are secondary forms. Why do we say, before non-शित् affixes? Observe ग्लै + शप् + तिप् = ग्लायति, म्लायति ॥ Exception is, however, made in the case of the affix एश् of the Perfect: as जग्ले, मम्ले ॥ This is explained by interpreting the word शित् as शिदादि, that is the affixes having an indicatory श in the beginning: एश् has श् at the end. This is done on the maxim यस्मिन् विधिस्तदादावल् ग्रहणे \"when a term which denotes a letter is exhibited in a rule in the form of the Locative case, and qualifies some thing else which likewise stands in the Locative case, that which is qualified by it must be regarded as beginning with the letter which is denoted by the term in question and not as ending with it\".\n\nThe word अशिति is an example of प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधः. a simple prohibition of a contingent case. Therefore, the substitution of आ for एच् vowels, is not caused by the affixes that follow, but must take place prior to the occasion for the application of the affixes arises. Thus (III. 1. 136) ordains क after roots ending in आ; so that ग्लै and म्लै are presupposed to end in आ when applying this affix: thus सुग्लः, सुम्लः ॥ Similarly by (III. 3. 128) we apply युच् to ग्लै and म्लै by presupposing it as आदन्त roots: as सुग्लानः, सुम्लानः ॥\n\nThe word आ is understood in all the subsequent _sutras_ upto (VI. I. 57).",
    "61046": "Thus संविव्याय, संविष्ययिथ ॥ The reduplicate of the Perfect is vocalised here by (VI. I. I7). The _Vriddhi_ in संविव्याय takes place by (VII. 2. 115) before the णित् affix णल् ॥",
    "61047": "Thus विस्फारः instead of विस्फोरः, and विस्फालः instead of विस्फोलः ॥ By (VIII. 3. 76), the स is optionally changed to ष after वि, as विष्फारः, and विष्फालः ॥",
    "61048": "Thus क्रापयति, अध्यापयति and जापयति ॥ The augment प् is added by (VII. 3. 36), since these roots end in long आ ॥",
    "61049": "The word पारलौकिक is derived from परलोक 'the next world' by adding the affix ठञ् with the force of 'for the sake of' (V. 1. 109). The double _Vriddhi_ takes place by (VII. 3. 20). The sense of the word सिध् must refer to अज्ञान or non-intelligent things for the purposes of this substitution. Thus अन्नं साधयति, ग्रामं साधयति ॥ Why do we say when not referring to the next world ? See तपस्तापसं सेधयति, स्वान्येवनं कर्माणि सेधयन्ति ॥ The force of सिध is here that of knowledge, तापसः सिद्ध्यति = ज्ञानावशेषमासादयति ॥ The ascetic acquires certain knowledge through austerities, the knowledge so acquired produces its result in the next world (परलोक) i. e. the next life, therefore, the साधन of the ascetic is for the sake of the next life, and so there is no substitution of आ for ए ॥ Why the substitution does not take place here : अन्नं साधयति, ब्राह्मणेभ्योदास्यामि 'he causes food to be prepared for the purpose of giving to the _Brahmanas_'. Here though the gist of the food produces effect in the next world, yet as that is the effect of दान and not of the verb सिध्, the substitution does take place. When the verb सिध् directly and not through the mediation of another action, produces _paraloukika_ effect, then the substitution does not take place. The verb सिध् here belongs to the _Divadi_ class and not to the _Bhvadi_, as the form सिध्यति in the _sutra_ shows it.",
    "61050": "By force of the word च 'and' in the _sutra_, the substitution takes place of the diphthongs also of these verbs before all affixes other than शित्, and this substitution takes place, before the occasion for the applying of the affixes arises (उपदेशावस्थायाम् आत्वं भवति) ॥ So that these verbs should be understood as if they were enunciated with an आ, so that all rules of affixes relating to आ will apply to them. Thus प्रमाता, प्रमातव्यम्, प्रमातुम्, प्रमाय, निमाता, निमातुम्, निमातव्यम्, निमाय, उपदाता, उपदातव्यम्, उपदातुम्, उपदाय ॥ The substitution of आ being understood to have taken place in the very उपदेश (in the _dhatupatha_) of these roots, the affixes relating to roots ending in इ or ई do not apply to these at all. Thus उपदायो वर्त्तते, ईषदुपदानं, formed by घञ् and युच् by taking दी = दा and adding these affixes (III. 3. 128) and (III. 3. 18) and not the affixes अच् (III. 3. 56) and खल् (III. 3. 126).",
    "61051": "The final of ली will take _guna_ substitution before शित् affixes, and will become ले, this incipient diphthong ए is changed to आ by this rule. The same is the case with all the roots subsequently taught, thus खिद् will be खेद्, and then ए changed to आ, गुर् = गोर् and ओ changed to आ &c. Therefore we have employed the _anuvritti_ of एच् 'diphthong' in all _sutras_. The words ल्याप and आदेच उपदेश are understood here. The roots ली belonging to _Divadi_ and _Kriyadi_ are both included here. Thus विलाता, विलातुम्, विलातव्यम्, विलाय, विलेता विलेतुम्, विलेतव्यम् and विलीय ॥\n\nVart:- The आ substitution does not take place when the affix अच् (III. 3. 56), (III. I. 134) and खल् (III. 3. 126) come after नि, मि, मी and ली : as, ईषन्निमयः, निमयो वर्त्तते । ईषत्प्रमयः, प्रमयो वर्त्तते । ईषद् विलयः, विलयो वर्त्तते ॥\n\nThe ली invariably takes आ substitution when the sense is that of 'showing respect', 'deceiving' or 'insulting'. As कस्त्वामुल्लापयते, श्येनो वर्त्तिकामुल्लापयते ॥ The option allowed by this aphorism is a restricted option (_vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_) The substitution of आ for the final of ई is optional when the sense of the root is not that of 'showing respect', 'subduing' or deceiving'. But when it has any one of these three senses, the substitution is compulsory. See (l. 1. 70).",

    "61056": "The words णौ and विभाषा are understood here. The word हेतु in the _sutra_ is the technical हेतु meaning स्वतन्त्रस्य प्रयोजक (I. 4. 54) and (I. 4. 55). When the _Hetu_ Agent himself is directly the cause of the fear, that fear is called the हेतुभय \"the fear caused by the _Hetu_\". Thus मुण्डो भापयते (VII. 3. 36) or भीषयते (VII. 3. 40). So also जटिलो भापयते or भीषयते ॥ This root takes the affixes of the _Atmanepada_, by (I. 3. 68); and the augment ष is added by (VII. 3. 40), which does not come when there is आ substitution, for the भी in (VII. 3. 40) is equal to भ् + ई i.e. भी ending in ई; and means भी ending in ई takes the augment ष ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when the agent of the causative is the producer of the fear'?

Observe सृष्टः, दृष्टः before the affix क्त ॥ The forms of roots being exhibited in the _sutra_, the rule applies when affixes relating to verbs come after these, and not when other affixes relating to noun follow. Thus रज्जुसृङ्भ्याम्, देवदृग्भ्याम् ॥ Here the words are used as nouns rather than verbs. For the maxim धातोः स्वरूपग्रहणे तत्प्रत्यये कार्ये applies here.",
    "61059": "The word उपदेश is understood here, so also झल्यमकिति ॥ Thus त्रप्ता or तर्पिता or तर्प्ता or द्रप्ता, दर्पिता or दर्प्ता ॥ The roots तृप 'to satisfy', and दृप् 'to be happy to release', belong to _Divadi_ class, sub-class _Radhadi_, and they take the augment इट् optionally (VII. 2. 45), so we have the three forms given above : for these roots are also _anudatta_ in their first enunciation.\n\nWhy do we say \"which are _anudatta_ in the _Upadesa_ or the system of grammatical instruction\"? Observe वर्ढा, वर्ढुम्, वर्ढव्यम्, from वृहू उद्यमने which is exhibited as उदात्त, and because it has an indicatory ऊ it takes इट् optionally. Why do we say 'having a penultimate ॠ letter'? Observe भेत्ता, छेत्ता ॥ Why do we say 'before an affix beginning with a mute or a sibilant'? Observe तर्पणम्, दर्पणम् ॥ Why do we say 'not having an indicatory क'?

The appropriate original is शिरस् ॥ Thus शीर्षण्यो हि मुख्यो भवति, शीर्षण्यः स्वरः ॥ The affix यत् is here added by (IV. 3. 55). The word शीर्षण् retains its original form before this affix यत्, the final अन् not being replaced by anything else (VI. 4. 168). Why do we say when 'a _Taddhita_-affix follows'? Observe शिर इच्छति = शिरस्यति, here य is not a _Taddhita_ affix, and so there is no substitution.\n\nVart:- The substitution is optional when meaning 'hair'. As शीर्षण्याः केशाः or शिरस्याः केशाः ॥",

So also स्थूलशिरस इदम् = स्थौलशीर्षम् ॥ Had the word been शीर्षन् (instead of शीर्ष as taught herein) then it would have retained its final न् before these affixes and would not have given the proper forms (VI. 4. 168). Again in forming the feminine of हास्तिशीर्षिः by adding ष्यङ् (IV. I.78), arises this difficulty :- ष्यङ् (य) is a _Taddhita_ affix beginning with य, when this is applied to हास्तिशीर्षिः, we must apply the last rule and change the शीर्ष into शीर्षन् (for शीर्षन् being the substitute of शिरस् is prima facie a substitute of शीर्ष also for the purposes of that rule (VI. I. 61)). The form which we get will be this, हास्तिशीर्षिः + ष्यङ् = हास्तिशीर्षण् + य (VI. I. 61) = हास्तिशीर्षण्या (VI. 4. 168). But this is a wrong form, the desired form is हास्तिशीर्ष्या ॥ How do we explain this? Thus हास्तिशीर्षि + ष्यङ् = हास्तिशीर्ष् + य (the इ is elided by (VI. 4. 148) and in the room of इ we substitute a zero or लोपादेश)॥ Now this _adesa_ becomes _sthanivat_ to इ, thus the affix य not being directly applied to शीर्ष, because this zero intervenes, शीर्ष is not replaced by शीर्षन् as required by (VI. 1. 61), for it is not followed by an affix beginning with य but by a zero _sthanivat_ to इञ् affix.\n\nThis _sutra_ is not of _Panini_, but is really a _Vartika_ raised to the rank of a _sutra_ by later authors.",
    "61063": "The _Kasika_ gives आसन् as the substitute for आसन, the _Sidhanta_ _Kaumudi_ gives the original as आस्य which has been adopted in the above. Some say that these substitutions take place in the Vedic Literature only, others say, they are general. Others read the word 'optionally' into this _sutra_ from (VI. I. 59) and hold that these substitutes are optional and not compulsory.\n\nExamples :--I. पद् - निपदश्चतुरो जहि, पदावतये गोदुहम् ॥ 2 दत् - या दती धावति तस्यै श्यावदन् ॥ 3 नस् – सूकरस्त्वखनन्नसा ॥ 4 मास् - मासित्वा पश्यामि चक्षुषा ॥ 5 हृद् - हृदा पूतेन मनसा जातवेदसम् ॥ 6 निश् - अमावास्यायां निशि यजेत ॥ 7 असन् – असित्को स्नावरोहति ॥ 8 यूषन् - या पात्राणि यूष्ण आसेचनानि ॥ 9 दोषन् - यत्ते दोष्णो दौर्भाग्यम् ॥ 10 यकन् - यक्नो वद्यति ॥ 11 शकन् - शक्नो वद्यति ॥ 12 उदन् - उद्नो दिव्यस्य नावा ते ॥ 13 आसन् - आसनि किं लभे मधूनि ।\n\nWhy do we say when the weak terminations शस &c follow? Observe पादौ ते प्रतिपीडयौ नासिके ते कृश ॥ As examples of this substitutions in the secular literature also, the following may be given :-\n\nव्यायामक्षुण्णगात्रस्य पद्भ्यामुद्वर्तितस्य च ।\nव्याधयो नोपसर्पन्ति वैनतेयमिवोरगाः ॥\n\nThese substitutions take place before other affixes also : as, शला दोषणी, ककुद्दोषणी याचते महादेवः ॥\n\nVart:- The following substitutions also take place : मांस for मांस, पत् for पतना, and स्नु for सानुः as यन्नीक्षणं मांस्पचन्याः for मांसपचन्याः (_Yaj_. XXV. 36), पृत्सु मर्त्यम् for पृतनासुमर्त्यम्, न ते दिवो न पृथिव्या अधिस्नुषु for अधिसानुषु ॥\n\nVart:- The नस् is substituted for नसिका only when the affixes यत् and तस्. and the word क्षुद्र follow : as, नस्यम्, नस्तः, नस् क्षुद्रः ॥ The यत् is taught in (IV. 3. 55) and (V. 1. 6); तस् is taught in (V. 4. 45).\n\nVart:- The substitution of नस् for नासिका before the affix यत् does not take place when it refers to 'letters', or 'cities' as: नासिक्यो वर्णः 'a nasal letter' नासिक्यं नगरम् ॥",
    "61064": "The roots exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with an initial ष, change it for स ॥ Thus षह -सहते, षिच् - सिंचति ॥ Why do we use the word 'root'? Observe षोडश, षडिकः, षण्डः ॥ Why do we say 'initial'? Observe – कर्षति, कृषति ॥ Why have then roots been exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with an initial ष, when for all practical purposes this  ष is to be replaced by स, would it not have been easier to spell at once these words with a स ? This appears cumbersome no doubt, but the spelling of the roots with ष is for the sake of brevity. Certain roots change their स into ष when preceded by certain letters: those roots which thus change their letter स for ष have been at once taught with an initial ष, and thus by (VIII. 3. 59) their स is changed to ष ॥ Thus from सिव - instead of सिसव we have सिषव ॥ Thus root is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with a ष, and thus we know that the स must be changed to ष ॥ Otherwise a list of such roots would have to be separately given. One must refer to the _Dhatupatha_ for a list of such roots. As a general rule, however, all roots beginning with a स and followed by a vowel or a dental letter have been taught in the _Dhatupatha_ as beginning with an initial ष, as well as the following roots स्मि, स्वद्, स्विद्, स्विज् and स्वप्, though followed by म् or व् ॥ The following roots though followed by a vowel or a dental are not taught with an initial ष viz. सृप्, सृज्, स्तृ, स्त्या, सेकृ and सृ ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the roots derived from nouns, and of ष्ठिव् and ष्वष्क ॥ Thus षोडीयते, षण्डायते are roots derived from nouns, and though these roots begin with ष are not changed: so ष्ठिव् – ष्ठिवति, ष्वष्क – ष्वष्कते ॥ The word ष्ठिव contains in it two roots ष्ठिव् and ष्थिव्, one with ठ, another with थ, and thus we have two forms in the reduplication :- तेष्ठीव्यते, टेष्ठीव्यते ॥ The substitution of स for ष takes place in the case of the root that has थ ॥",
    "61065": "The phrase धात्वादेः is understood here. Thus णीञ् - नयति, णम - नमति, णह - नह्यति ॥ But not अण् - अणति ॥ This does not apply to roots derived from nouns. णकारमिच्छति = णकारीयात ॥The roots are exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with ण् for a similar reason as they are exibited with ष ॥ By (VIII. 4. 14), these roots change their न into ण when preceded by certain prepositions. All roots beginning with a ण should be understood to have been so taught, with the exception of the following:- नृ, नन्दि नर्दि, नक्क, नाटि, नाधृ and नाथृ ॥",
    "61066": "The final व् or य् of any stem, be it a root or not, is elided by an affix &c, beginning with a वल् consonant i. e. any consonant except य् ॥ Thus दिव् + वस् (III. 2. 107) = दिव् + दिव् + वस् = दिदिवस् nominative singular दिदिवान्, दिदिवांसौ, दिदिवांसः ॥ Thus ऊय् + त = ऊतं, 'spun', क्नूय् + त = क्नूतं 'made a noise'. So also the affix ढ्रक् comes after गोधा in forming patronymic (IV. 1. 129). Of the affix ढ्रक्, ढ is replaced by एय् (VII. 1. 2). Thus गोधा + एय् + र = गौधेरः (the य् of the affix being even elided before र) ॥ So also in पचेरन्, यजेरन् the य् of लिङ् (III. 4. 102) is elided before रन् (III. 4. 105). So also व is elided in the following :-- from जीव् - जीरदानुः (by _Unadi_ affix जीवे रदानुक्) from स्रिव् -अस्रेमाणम् formed by the _Unadi_ affix मनिन् with the negative अ ॥ There being diversity in the application of _Unadi_ affixes (III. 3. 1), there is not substitution ऊठ् for व् as required by (VI. 4. 19).\n\nWhy do we say \"before any consonant except य?\" Observe ऊय्यते, क्नूय्यते when य् is not elided. Why the word लोप is placed first? The elision of व् and ल् should take place prior to the elision of the _aprrikta_ व् taught in the next _sutra_. Thus कण्डूय + क्विप् = कण्डू य् (VI. 4. 48) = कण्डू + त् = कण्डूः ॥ So लोलूय + क्विप् = लोलूः ॥ \"Why व् of व्रश्च is not elided before र् which is a वल् consonant? It is not elided, because it is so taught. Had the elision of व् been intended, the root would have been enunciated as रश्च instead of व्रश्च ॥ If you say the व is taught for the sake of forms like वृश्चति by _samprasarana_ and वव्रश्च by reduplication, here also the '_lopa_' would have applied, as being an _Antaranga_ rule, while _samprasarana_, and the elision of र् by हलादिशेषः are _Bahiranga_.",
    "61067": "The affix वि includes क्विप्, क्विन्, ण्वि &c. In all these, the real affix is व्, which being an _aprikta_ (I. 2. 41), is elided. Thus ब्रह्महा, भ्रूणहा (III. 2. 87). Here the affix क्विप् is elided. So also घृतस्पृक्, तैलस्पृक् (III. 2. 58). Here the affix क्विन् is elided. So also अर्धभाक्, पादभाक्, तुरीयभाक् (III. 2. 62). Here the affix ण्वि is elided.\n\nWhy do we say \"of an _aprikta_-an affix consisting of a single letter\"? Observe दर्विः formed by the affix विन् (वि being the real affix); so also जागृविः formed क्विन्, see _Unadi_ _Sutras_ IV. 53. 44. No root can become a noun unless some _krit_ affix is added to it (see (I. 2. 45) and (I. 2. 46)); hence the necessity of these imaginary affixes, in order to raise certain roots bodily, without any change, to the rank of nouns--from _Dhatu_ to a _Pratipadika_ the way lies only through an affix. And though these imaginary affixes are after all totally elided, yet by (I. 1. 62), they leave their characteristic mark behind, namely the derivative word becomes a nominal stem &c. Thus च्वि words are adverbs (_Gati_) and Indeclinables.",
    "61068": "The _sutra_ translated literally means :- After a word ending in a consonant, or ङी, or आप् when a long vowel, the affixes सु, ति and सि when reduced to a single consonant affix (अपृक्तं हल्) are elided. But ति and सि are elided only after a consonant and hence we have translated it as above. As examples of the elision of सु after a consonant:- राजन् + स् = राजान् (VI. 4. 8) + ० = राजा, तक्षा, उखास्रत्, पर्णध्वत् ॥ After a ङी :- कुमारी, गौरी, शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ After आप् :- खट्वा, बहुराजा, कारीषगन्धा ॥ The elision of ति and सि takes place only after consonants :-as, अबिभर्भवान् (भृ + लङ् + तिप् = अ + भृ + श्लु + त् = अ + भृ + भृ + त् (VI. 1. 10) = अ + भर् + भृ + त् (VII. 4. 66) and (I. 1. 51) = अ + बि + भर् + त् (VII. 4. 60) = अ + ब + भृ + त् (VIII. 4. 54) = अ + बि + भृ + त् (VII. 4. 76) = अ + बि + भर् + त् (VII. 3. 84) = अबिभर् + त् = अबिभर् ॥ So also अजागर् भवान् ॥ In both these cases त् of the Imperfect has been elided. The स् is elided in the following:- अभिनोऽत्र, अच्छिनोऽत्र  ॥ (भिद् + लङ् + सिप् ॥ The द् is changed into र् by (VIII. 2. 75) and स् is elided by this rule).\n\nWhy do we say \"after a consonant, or a feminine affix ई and आ\"? Observe ग्रामणीः, सेनानीः ॥ Why do we say \"after a long vowelled feminine affix\"? Observe निष्कौशाम्बिः, अतिखट्वः, where the feminine affixes have been shortened. Why do we say \"when followed by सु, ति and सि\"? Observe अभैत्सीत् ॥ The सि being read along with ति, does not include सिच्, but refers to सिप् only. Why do we say 'when reduced to a single letter'? Observe भिनत्ति, छिनत्ति ॥ Why do we say 'the consonant is elided'? Observe बिभेद, चिच्छेद ॥ Here the _aprikta_ affix अ of the Perfect is not elided : though it being the substitute of ति is like ति, and ought to have been elided, had the word हल् not been used in the _sutra_.\n\nWhy has the elision of स् (सु), त् (तिप्) and स् (सिप्) been ordained after consonants, as they would of themselves have been dropped by (VIII. 2. 23), being the finals of a compound consonant? Then the forms राजा, तक्षा could not be evolved. As राजन् + स् = राजान् + स् (VI. 4. 8) = राजान्स् and by eliding स् by Rule (VIII. 2. 23), the form would have become राजान्, and the final न् could not have been elided by (VIII. 2.7); for it is a maxim enunciated in the very opening of the Second chapter of the 8th Book, that in the last three chapters of that Book (2nd, 3rd and 4th Books), a subsequent rule is as if it had not taken effect, so far as any preceding rule is concerned; therefore, the rule (VIII. 2. 7) ordaining the elision of न्, does not find scope, since (VIII. 2. 23) (ordaining elision of स्) is considered as if it had not taken effect. So also in the case of उखास्रत् and पर्णध्वत् ॥ उखा + स्रन्ग् + क्विप् (III. 2. 76) = उखा + स्रस् (the nasal being elided by (VI. 4. 24)); now add सु, we have उखास्रस् + स् = उखास्रस्स; elide the final स् not by this rule, but by (VIII. 2. 23), we have उखास्रस्, here we cannot change the स् into द् by (VIII. 2. 72) for स् is not final in a _pada_, for Rule (VIII. 2. 23) is considered as not to have taken effect. So also in the case of अभिनोऽत्र ॥ The word अभिनः is 2nd. Person singular of the Imperfect of भिद् of _Rudhadi_ class. Thus भिद् + लङ् + सिप् = अ + भिद् + श्नम् + स् = अ + भिनद् + स् = अभिनर् + स् (द changed to र् by (VIII. 2. 75)) = अभिनर्स् ॥ If we elide the final स् of the conjunct by (VIII. 2. 23), then in अभिनर् + अत्र, the र् would not be changed into उ to form अभिनोऽत्र by (VI. 1. 113) since the elision of स् is considered as to have not taken effect when applying this rule. So also in अबिभर् भवान्, by Rule (VIII. 2. 24), there would be no _lopa_ even, for संयोगान्तलोप rule is restricted by रात्सस्य (VIII. 2. 24), i. e. स्  only and no other consonant is elided after र्, therefore there will be no elision of त् in अबिभर्त् by (VIII. 2. 23).",
    "61069": "The word लोप is understood here also; as well as हल् ॥ The word अपृक्त however is not to be read here, as its repetition in (VI. 1. 68) (though its _anuvritti_ was there from the preceding _sutra_) indicates. The affix of Vocative is the same as that of the nominative. By (VII. 3. 108), the short vowel of the stem is replaced by a _guna_ vowel when the Vocative Singular affix follows. Thus we have अग्ने and वायो for अग्नि and वायु; and by (VII. 3. 107), a short vowel is substituted for the long vowel ई and ऊ of the feminine: as नदि and वधु for नदी and वधू ॥ Now applying the present _sutra_, the affix स् is elided after all the above words. As हे अग्ने !, हे वायो !, हे देवदत्त !, हे नदि !, हे वधु ! The Vocative Singular of कुण्ड a Neuter noun is thus formed. By (VII. 1. 24), अम् replaces स् of the nominative, the अ of अम् and the final अ of कुण्ड coalesce into one अ by (VI. 1. 107), which becomes कुण्डम् ॥ Here by the rule that 'consonant' only is to be elided, we elide म् only (and not अ which becomes a part of the word by (VI. 1. 85), for it is considered both as the final of the word and the initial of the affix). Now म् is not an अपृक्तं हल् for it is part of the affix अम्, and its elision would not have taken place had we read the _anuvritti_ of _aprikta_ into this _sutra_. Thus we have हे कुण्ड ! ॥ But in हे कतरत् ! there is not the elision of the त् of the affix अत्, the substitute of सु for the affix there is अद्ड् (VII. 1. 25). This affix being डित् causes the elision of the final अ of कतर (VI. 4. 143), and we have कतर् + अत्, here we have not a _pratipadika_ which ends in a short vowel, but in a consonant hence त् is not elided. See also (VII. I. 25). The word एङ् is used in the _sutra_ in order to indicate that the _guna_ substitution is stronger than _lopa_. Therefore in हे अग्नि + सु, the affix is not elided first and then _guna_ substituted for इ, but first there is _guna_ substitution and then the affix is elided.",
    "61070": "Thus या क्षेत्रा or यानि क्षेत्राणि, या वना or यानि वनानि ॥",
    "61071": "Thus अग्नि + चि + क्विप् = अग्निचित्, so also सोमसुत् ॥ Similarly प्रकृत्य and प्रहृत्य and उपस्तुत्य formed by the affix ल्यप् ॥ Why do we say \"ending in a short vowel\"? Observe आलूय, ग्रामणीः ॥ Why do we say \"having an indicatory प\"? Observe कूतम्, हृतम् ॥ Why do we say \"a _krit_ affix\"? Observe पटुतरः, पटुतमः, with the _Taddhita_-affixes तरप् and तमप् ॥ In the compound ग्रामणिकुलम्, though the root is made short, yet there is no augment तुक्, in as much as the rule by which the root has been shortened is a _Bahiranga_ rule, and the present rule is an _Antaranga_ one. The maxim is असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे ॥ \"That which is _Bahiranga_ is regarded as not having taken effect, or as not existing, when that which is _Antaranga_ is to take effect\".",
    "61072": "This is an _adhikara_ or governing _sutra_, exerting its influence upto (VI. 1. 158). What ever we shall say in the _sutras_ preceding that, must be understood to apply to words which are in संहिता, that is, which are pronounced together with an uninterrupted voice. Thus दध्यत्र, मध्वत्र the इ and उ are changed to य and व when the two words are pronounced without any hiatus. Otherwise we shall have दधि अत्र, मधु अत्र ॥",
    "61073": "Thus इच्छति, गच्छति ॥ The त is change to च by (VIII. 4. 40). The short vowel itself is the आगमी (the thing to which the augment is added), and not the word ending in that short vowel. Therefore in चिच्छिदतुः, चिच्छिदुः, the augment is not to be considered as part of the Reduplicate चि, but of the short इ only; and therefore it is not elided by हलादिः शेष (VII. 4. 60) rule applying to reduplicates. This follows on the maxim नावयवावयवः समुदायावयवो भवति \"the part of a part cannot be considered as a part of the whole\". Here त् is a part of the _abhyasa_ syllable चि which is itself a part of the verbal base, therefore त् is not considered as an _abhyasa_: or because त् being an augment of इ is considered as part of इ and not of चि of which इ is the part.",

With verbs:-as आच्छादयति, 3 and 4., आच्छायायाः, आच्छायम् ॥  So also the negative particle मा, as, माच्छैत्सीत्, माच्छिदत् ॥ The ङ् in आङ् and माङ् shows that आ when used as a _Gati_ and a _Karmapravachaniya_ and मा when used as a negative particle are meant. Therefore, the त् is not necessary in the following :-आछाया मानयति, प्रमाछन्दः ॥ The तुक may be optionally added in these as आच्छाया and प्रमाच्छन्दः ॥ The आ here has the force of recollection (स्मरण); आछाया \"Oh the shade\". The word प्रमा is formed from the verbal root माङ् by the prefix प्र and the affix अङ् (III. 3. 106) with the feminine affix टाप्, and the word ending in टाप् has not the indicatory ङ् ॥",

Thus कूटीच्छाया or कुटीछाया, कूवलीच्छाया or कुवलीछाया ॥ The तुक् augment here is added to the end of a _pada_, and this is therefore a _padanta_ rule and not a _pada_-_vidhi_. Therefore the two words need not be in construction for the application of this rule; (समर्थ पदविधि) not applying. Thus तिष्ठतु कुमारीच्छत्रं हर देवदत्तस्य, \"let the girl stay. Take the umbrella of _Devadatta_\". Here कुमारी and छत्रं are not in construction, but तुक् is still added optionally.\n\nVart:- The augment त is optional in the _Chhandas_, after the words विश्वजन &c.

For then, though it may be all right in the case of बभ्रु + य = बाभ्रो + य = बाभ्रव्यः; it will not apply to cases like गो + य = गव्य, नौ + य = नाव्य, where ओ and औ are not caused by the affix, but are integral parts of the stem before the affixes were added. Why do we say 'caused by that affix itself'? The substitution will not take place, when the change is not caused by that affix. Thus the Passive of वे with the _upasarga_ आ is आ + वे + यक् + ते = Here by _Samprasarana_ (VI. 1. 15), वे becomes उ; as आ + उ + य + ते; now by _sandhi_ आ + उ = ओ (VI. 1. 87), we have ओ + यते = ओयते ॥ Since ओ is not caused by य, there is no अव् substitution. So also औयत, लौयमानिः, पौयमानिः (IV. 1. 95). The word एव in the aphorism has the force of limitation, with regard to roots. In the case of roots, ओ and औ before य are changed then only to अव् and आव् when य has caused the production of ओ and औ; in case of nouns there is no such limitation. Here the substitution takes place whether the य has caused the production of ओ and औ or not.",

In every _sutra_ upto (VI. 1. 112) (excluding the last), whatever we shall teach, there in the room of the two, namely, the preceding and the succeeding, it should be understood, that the substitution is one. These form the well known rules of _ekadesa_, one letter or form replacing two consecutive letters &c. Thus (VI. 1. 87) teaches 'There is _guna_ substitution, when अ or आ is followed by a vowel'. We must supply into that _sutra_ the phrase एकः पूर्वपरयोः i. e. one _guna_ is the substitute for the final अ or आ and the initial vowel. Thus खट्वा + इन्द्रः = खट्वेन्द्रः ॥ Here ए is the single substitute of the both preceding Ietter आ and the succeeding letter इ ॥ The words पूर्व पर show that the substitute operates simultaneously on both. Otherwise the substitute would have come in the place of one only or of each one separately. Thus in आद् गुणः (अचि) = \"after अ or आ, there is _guna_, in a vowel\". Here आत् is in this ablative, and by (I. 1. 67) the _guna_ operation would have taken place on the letter following it: so also अचि is in the Locative and by (I. 1. 66), the _guna_ operation would have taken place on the preceding; so it is not clear of what letter there should be _guna_ substitution, of the preceding or the succeeding. But the present rule shows it must operate on both simultaneously. The word एक 'single', shows that a separate or a different substitute does not operate: i. e. the substitute must be one, there should not be two separate substitutes one for each _sthani_, such as we find in the _sutra_ (VIII. 2. 42) (रदाभ्यां निष्ठातो नः, पूर्वस्य च दः \"न is the substitute of the त of _nishtha_, after र् and द, and of the preceding द\"). Here न् is taught as substitute both of त् and द्, and as एक is not used in the _sutra_, we get two न, as भिद् + त = भिन् + न = भिन्नः ॥ But this is not the case here. According to _Mahabhashya_ the word एक is redundant.",
    "61085": "The single substitute taught in the last, is considered in the light of the final of the preceding form and the initial of the succeeding. An _adesa_ is like the _sthani_, but in an _ekadesa_, the _sthani_ is indeterminate, or rather the _sthani_ is the collection or the sum of the preceding and the succeeding. Hence the necessity of this _sutra_. The sense of this _atidesa_ _sutra_ is this: as the beginning and the end of a thing are both included in the thing itself, and therefore when the thing is mentioned, the beginning and the end are both taken; so is the case with this single substitute. Thus to the stem ब्रह्मबन्धु we add ऊ the feminine affix (IV. 1. 66); and now उ + ऊ = ऊ (VI. 1. 101) i. e. ब्रह्मबन्धु + ऊ = ब्रह्मबन्धू ॥ Here ब्रह्मबन्धु is a Nominal-stem (प्रातिपदिक) and the affix ऊ is a non-_pratipadika_, and the single-substitute ऊ is considered as the final of the _pratipadika_. So that we can apply to the form ब्रह्मबन्धु the term _pratipadika_ and by virtue of this designation we can add the case-endings to it by (IV. 1. 1). But for this rule, we could not have added the case-endings to it, because by virtue of the feminine affix ऊ the word would have rather ceased to be a _pratipadika_ (I. I. 46), because this feminine affix ऊ is not included in (IV. 1. 1). Similarly for the final non-case-ending अ of वृक्ष and the case-ending औ, there comes a single substitute औ by (VI. 1. 88), this _ekadesa_ औ is considered both as a non-case affix and a case affix, that is, as the initial of the affix औ, and the final of वृक्ष and thus the word वृक्षौ gets the designation of _Pada_ (I. 4. 14) as it ends in the सुप् affix औ ॥\n\nThis अन्तादिवद्भाव does not apply in rules relating to letters i. e. to rules depending for their application on letters. Thus खट्व + आ = खट्वा ॥ Here the _ekadesa_ आ is as the final अ of खट्व, but not for the purposes of the application of the rule which says that the भिस् is changed to ऐस् after a nominal-stem ending in अ, so the Instrumental plural of खट्वा will not end in ऐः, but will be खट्वाभिः ॥ So also in जुहाव ॥ It is the Perfect 3rd person singular of ह्वे or ह्वा ( VI. 1. 45). By (VI. 1. 53), the व् is changed to उ, and we have जुह्व्आ = जुह्उआ which by (VI. 1. 108) becomes जुहु, the उ being the single substitute of उ and आ ॥ This single-substitute उ should not be considered as आ for the application of the rule (VII. 1. 34) by which the Perfect affix णल् (अ) is changed in औ after roots ending in आ ॥ Similarly in अस्यै + अश्वः = अस्या अश्वः (the य् being elided by (VIII. 3. 19)). अस्यै is the Dative singular of इदम् in the Feminine with आ ॥ By (VII. 3. 114) स्या is added in the Dative with the shortening of the preceding  आ; as अ + स्या + ए = अस्यै (Here ऐ is the single substitute for आ and ए ॥ Here for the application of (VI. 1. 109) the single substitute ऐ should not be considered like ए ॥ The _sthani_ of the single-substitute (_ekadesa_) is the sum of the preceding and the succeeding, both taken collectively is replaced by one, and not any one of them separately. For that which is replaced by another is called _sthani_: as when भू replaces अस् the whole form अस् is called _sthani_, and not अ or स् separately. The parts, may be called _sthani_ only inferentially, because the whole is made up of parts. The parts not being considered as _sthani_, the rule of _sthanivad_ _bhava_ will not apply to an _ekadesa_ with regards to the parts, and no operations dependant on such parts will be effected by such _ekadesa_. But it is intended that such operations should take place. Hence this _sutra_.",
    "61086": "The word असिद्ध means not-accomplished i. e. the operation caused by its having taken effect is not produced. The word _asiddha_ always debars operations dependent upon this _adesa_, and gives scope to the operations dependent upon the general rule ( असिद्धवचनमादेशलक्षणप्रतिषेदार्थमुत्संगलक्षणभावार्थं च ॥) Thus कांऽसिचत् here स is not changed to ष ॥ The equation is thus exhibited : कस् + असिचत् = कर् + असिचत् (the स changed to र by (VIII. 2. 66)) कंउ + असिचत् (उ being substituted for र by (VI. 1. 113)) = को + असिचत् (अ + उ = ओ (VI. 1. 87))  = कोऽसिचत् (ओ + अ = ओ (VI. 1. 109)). Now applies our _sutra_. By (VIII. 3. 59), स coming after ओ required to be changed into ष, but here the single-substitute ओ is considered to be non-effective for this purpose. Similarly कोऽस्य, योऽस्य, कोऽस्मै, यौऽस्मै ॥ Similarly in अधीत्य there is the addition of त् by (VI. 1. 71), though actually preceded by a long vowel. That long vowel had resulted from the _ekadesa_ of ई for इ + इ, and this _ekadesa_ is considered as if non-effective for the purposes of तुक् augment. Similarly in प्र + इ + तुक् + य = प्रेत्य. Here also अ + इ = ए is considered _asiddha_.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of _samprasarana_, the Locative singular case-ending is ङि (इ), and the Ist person singular _Atmanepada_ affix इट् ॥ Of vocalisation we have the following : शकहूष् = शकान् ह्वयति, then we add क्विप्, before which there is vocalisation of व्, this उ combining with in the following आ becomes उ _ekadesa_: as शकहा + क्विप् = शकह्उआ + ० (VI. I. I5) + शकहु (VI. I. 108). The Locative plural is formed by सु : शकहु + सु = शकहूषु (the lengthening taking place by (VI. 4. 2)). Here स is changed to ष the _ekadesa_ उ for उ + अ not being considered _asiddha_. So also परिवीषु (परि + ष्ये + क्विप् = परि + व्इए + क्विप् = परिवि, add सु)॥ Of the affix ङि we have:- वृक्ष + इ = वृक्षे, add छत्रम्, then the single substitute ए being considered not _asiddha_ we have वृक्षेच्छत्रम् or वृक्षेछत्रम् ॥ Of the affix इट् of Ist Person _Atmanepada_ we have अपचे + छत्रम् = अपचेच्छत्रम् or अपचेछत्रम् ॥  In both these cases we optionally add तुक् by (VI. I. 75) - (VI. I. 76), by considering the _ekadesa_ (VI. 1. 87) as to have taken effect, and making the finals दीर्घ or long. Here the _ekadesa_ is not _asiddha_ and therefore तुक् is optional and not compulsory.",
    "61087": "The word अचि is understood here. For the vowel which follows an अ or आ, and for the अ or आ which precedes a vowel, in the room of both these preceding and succeeding vowels, there is the single substitute _guna_.

Thus ब्रह्म + एडका = ब्रह्मैडका, खट्वा + एडका = खट्वैडका, ब्रह्म + ऐतिकायनः = ब्रह्मैतिकायनः, खट्वा + एतिकायनः = खट्वैतिकायनः ॥ ब्रह्म + ओदनः = ब्रह्मौदनः, खट्वा + ओदनः = खट्वौदनः, ब्रह्म + औपगवः = ब्रह्मापगवः, खट्वा + औपगवः = खट्वौपगवः ॥",

The एच् of the last _sutra_ qualifies the root इ in एति, i. e. when the root इ assumes the form ए by internal changes, then apples this _Vriddhi_ rule. The एच् does not qualify the root एध् as that root always has an initial diphthong, nor does एच् qualify ऊठ् for ऊ is not a diphthong. Thus उप + एति = उपैति, उप + एषि = उपैषि, उपैमि; उप + एधते = उपैधते, प्रैधते; प्रष्ठ + ऊहा = प्रष्ठौहा ॥ In the last example, _guna_ was the substitute required by (VI. 1. 87), the present _sutra_ ordains _Vriddhi_ instead. In the case of एति and एधति, the _Vriddhi_ was debarred by (VI. I. 94): this _sutra_ makes an exception to that rule. The present _sutra_ is an exception to (VI. 1. 94) and not to (VI. 1. 95), because the maxim is पुरस्तादपवादा अनन्तरान् विधीन् बाधन्ते नोत्तरान् \"_Apavadas_ that precede the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the _apavada_ operations, supersede only those rules that stand nearest to them, not the subsequent rules\". Therefore the present rule does not apply here,:- उप + आ + इत = उप + एत = उपेतः (Here though इ is changed to ए, the rule does not apply). Therefore the form अवैहि is wrong. So also उप + इत = उपेतः for here the root इ has not assumed the form ए, therefore the rule does not apply, the word एचि qualifies the root इ ॥\n\nVart:- The _Vriddhi_ is the single substitute when अक्ष is followed by ऊहिनी, as अक्षौहिणी सेना ॥\n\nVart:- The _Vriddhi_ is the single substitute when स्व is followed by ईर or ईरिण, or ईरिणी thus स्वैरम्, स्वैरिणी ॥ The word ईर is formed by the affix घञ् added to ईर्गतौ (Ad. 8 स्वेनाभिप्रायेण ईरणं = स्वैरम् the compounding takes place by (II. 1. 32).

The word अम् here means the affix of the Accusative Singular, as it is read in connection with the case-affix शस्, and as the word सुप् of the last _sutra_ governs this also.

Thus भिन्द् + यासुट् + झि (the यासुट् is added by (III. 4. 103)) = भिन्द् + य + उस् (जुस् replaced झि (III. 4. 108)) = भिन्द्युस् ॥ अदा + सिच् + झि = अदा + o (II. 4. 77) + जुस् (III. 4. 10) = अदा + उस् = अदुः ॥ अ + या + झि = अ + या + उस् (VI. 4. 111) = अयुः ॥ The उस् is also the substitute of झि in लिट् (Perfect) see (III.4. 82). When the preceding vowel is not अ or आ, this rule does not apply. Thus the 3rd person plural of the Perfect of कृ is:- चकृ + उस् = चक्रुः ॥ So also from भी we have अबिभे + उस् = अबिभयुः ॥ The word अपदान्तात् 'not being final in a _pada_' does strictly speaking, serve no good purpose in this _sutra_. For the affix उस् can never be added to a _Pada_, it must always be added to a stem, that has not yet risen to the rank of a _Pada_. If उस्, however, be taken as the syllable उस् (whether an affix or part of an affix or not), then the limitation of अपदान्तात् becomes valid.

Therefore, so long as it does not come into operation it is not accomplished. Therefore first the rule of नाज् झलौ comes into play, then the rule of सवर्ण definition (I. 1. 9) and then comes the ग्रहणकवाक्यं (I. 1. 68). Therefore in नाज् झलौ those अच् only are taken which are not included in the class of homogenous vowels i. e. only the 9 vowels contained directly in अच्, and not the सवर्ण vowels which (I. 1. 68) would have denoted.

Thus अग्नि + औ = अग्नी; वायु + औ = वायू; वृक्ष + अस् = वृक्षाः, so also प्लक्षाः, वृक्षान्, प्लक्षान् ॥ In the case of these last four examples (वृक्ष + अस् &c) the rule (VI. 1. 97) would have caused _para_-_rupa_ substitution i. e. would have given the form वृक्ष + अस् = वृक्षः, and that rule would have debarred the lengthening rule (VI. 1. 101) on the maxim \"_apavadas_ that precede the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the _apavada_ operations, supersede those rules that stand nearest to them;\" but not this पुर्वसवर्ण lengthening rule as it does not stand nearest. The word अचि 'when a vowel follows' is understood here also. Thus वृक्ष + स् = वृक्षः, प्लक्षः ॥ The word अक् 'the simple vowel' is understood here also. Thus नौ + औ = नावौ ॥ Why do we say 'a vowel homogenous to the antecedent?' The substitute will not be one homogenous to the second or the subsequent vowel.

Now the word चञ्चा formed by the elision of कन् meaning a figure like a चञ्चा (V. 3. 98), may refer to both the males and females. It will however retain its feminine form though referring to a male being (See लुपि युक्तवद् व्यक्ति वचने ((I. 2. 51)). In forming the accusative plural of चंचा, the स् will not be changed into न् ॥ Thus चंचाः पश्य, वध्रिकाः पश्य ॥ Why do we say 'after such a long vowel homogenous with the first'?

I. 24) प्लक्षम्, अग्नि + अम् = अग्निम्, वायुम् ॥ The word पूर्व 'antecedent, first' in the _sutra_ shows that the first vowel itself is substituted and not any of its homogenous vowels. Otherwise in कुमारी + अम् = कुमारीम् the ई would have been of three _matras_ or measures, as it comes in the room of ई + अ, the aggregate _matras_ of which are three.\n\nIn the Vedas, there is option, as शमीं or शम्यं, गौरीं or गौर्यम् ॥ अम् is the ending of the Accusative singular of all genders and also of the nominative singular in the Neuter in certain cases.

    "61108": "The word पूर्व is understood here. When a vocalised semi-vowel is followed by a vowel, the vocalised vowel is alone substituted, the subsequent vowel merging in it. Thus यज् + क्त = इअज् + क्त (VI. 1. 15) = इष्टम् (इ + अ = इ); so उप्तम् (वप् + क्त = उअय् + त), ग्रह् + इत = गृअह् + इत = गृहीतं ॥\nHad there not been this merging, the vocalisation would become either useless or the two vowels would have been heard separately without _sandhi_. Thus in वप् + त = उअप् + त, if the अ did not merge in उ, then it would cause _sandhi_, and उ would be changed to व् by इकोयणचि and the word would again assume the form वप् ॥ But this यणादेश would causes _samprasarana_ rule non-effective, hence it follows that but for the present rule, the two vowels would have been heard separately as उ अप्त ॥\n\nThe rule of option in the _Chhandas_ (VI. 1. 106) applies here also. Thus we have यज्यमानौ मित्रावरुणौ or इज्यमानौ ॥ \"When you have just said that the two vowels will remain separate and there will be no यणादेश when there is no _purvavad_-_bhava_  we do you form यज्यमान्; it ought to be इ अज्यमान्\"? We have only said that vocalisation rule becomes useless if there was not this rule of merging of the subsequent vowel; but where there is this rule of _purva_-_vad_-_bhava_, and only an option is allowed, then the rule of vocalisation does not become totally useless because it finds its scope in cases like इष्टः &c, therefore when in the alternative it is not applied, there यणादेश will take place naturally, and this ordinary rules of _sandhi_ will apply. The merging, moreover, refers to the vowel which is in the same _anga_ or base with the _samprasarana_. Thus शकान् ह्वयात = शकह्वा + क्विप् = शकह् उ आ = शखू ॥ Here आ which is in the same अङ्ग with हु merges in to उ ॥ But in forming the dual, we have शकहू + औ ॥ Here औ coming after the _samprasarana_ ऊ does not merge therein, and we have शकह्वौ ॥ Similarly शकहू + अर्थं = शकह्वर्थम् ॥ In fact when once the _para_-_purvatva_ has taken effect, then subsequent vowels will produce their effect because in the _antaranga_ operation इ अ ष्ट into इष्ट, the _purva_-_rupa_ is ordained to save the _samprasarana_ from modification, but there is no such necessity when a _Bahiranga_ operation is to be applied.",

So the उ may be called the substitute of ऋ or अ) II The final स् is then elided by (VIII. 2. 24) and we have होतुर् = होतुः ॥ Thus होतुरागच्छति, होतुः स्वम् ॥",

Now by adding क्विप् to the denominative root सखीय we get सखीः 'one who wishes for a friend'. The Ablative and Genitive Singular of this word will be सखी + अस् = सख्युः also. Of ती we have the following example. लूनमिच्छति = लूनीय, add क्विप् = लूनीः, the Ablative and Genitive singular of which is also लून्युः, the न् of लूनी being the substitute of त् of _Nishtha_, is considered like त् (VIII. 2. 1). The peculiar exhibition of ख्य and त्य in the _sutra_, instead of saying directly सखिपतिभ्यां indicates that the rule does not apply to words like अतिसखि &c : where we have अतिसखेः, सेनापतेः ॥ The word अतिसखि is घि in spite of the prohibition (l. 4. 7), for that prohibition applies only to सखि and not to a compound which ends in it, on the maxim ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधिर्नास्ति ॥ \"That which cannot possibly be anything but a _Pratipadika_ does (contrary to (I. 1. 72)) not denote that which ends with it, but it denotes only itself\". According to Dr. Ballantyne this rule applies to all खी and ती, such as सुखीः 'one who loves pleasure' (सुखमिच्छति = सुखीय + क्विप्). and सुतीः 'one who wishes a son' (सुतमिच्छति = सुतीय + क्विप्): Thus सुख्युः, सुत्युः &c.",

The prolation of vowels is taught in the _tripadi_ or the last three chapters of _Ashtadhyayi_; and the _tripadi_ are considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of previous _sutras_ (VIII. 2. 1.). This is not the case here, otherwise the mention of _pluta_ would be redundant. Of the Excepted or _Pragrihya_ vowels the following are the examples : अग्नी इति, वायू इति, खट्वे इति, माले इति ॥ Though the _anuvritti_ of अचि was current in this _sutra_ from (VI. 1. 77): its repetition here is for the sake of ordaining प्रकृतिभाव ॥ That is, the _pluta_ and the _pragrihya_ retain their original forms when such a vowel follows which would have caused a substitution. Thus जानु उ अस्य, रुजति here in combining जानु + उ into जानू, the अ is no cause of lengthening, therefore, the lengthening will take place. Now since उ is a _pragrihya_, it follows that जानू which ends in उ is also a _pragrihya_, and therefore it should not be changed before  अ of अस्य ॥ Hence we have the form जानू + अस्य = जानू अस्य ॥ There may also be the form जान्वस्य, not by इकोयणचि, but by मय उञो वो वा (VIII. 3. 33). In fact, the repetition of अचि in this _sutra_ is necessary, in order to enable us to give this peculiar meaning to the _sutra_. Otherwise, had the _sutra_ been simply प्लुतप्रगृह्याः, it would have been translated ordinarily thus: \"The _Pluta_ and _Pragrihya_ retain their form, when ever a vowel follows\". Therefore in जानु उ अस्य, since उ is followed by a vowel, it will retain its form, and will not coalesce with the उ of जानु ॥ But this is not intended. Hence the repetition of the word अचि, and the peculiar explanation given above, namely, _Pluta_ and _Pragrihya_ vowels retain their form before a vowel which would otherwise have caused a substitution, but it would not prevent the operation of any other rule. Therefore in जानु उ अस्य रुजति, the उ + उ will become lengthened, because अ is not the cause of lengthening; it causes the change of उ to व्, which of course is prevented.

By not using वत्, the whole _Pluta_ itself would be changed into _Apluta_, and would give rise to the following incongruity. There is _prakriti_ _bhava_ in the case of _pluta_ and _pragrihya_. A vowel which is _pluta_ need not be _pragrihya_, nor a _pragrihya_, a _pluta_. But where a vowel is both a _pluta_ and a _pragrihya_ at one and the sametime, there will arise the difficulty. Thus in the dual अग्नी or वायू, the इ and ऊ are _pragrihya_. They may be made _pluta_ also as अग्ना ३ or वायू ३ ॥ Now if before इति, the _pluta_ became _apluta_, then we shall not hear the prolation at all in अग्नी इति वायू इति formed by अग्नी ३ + इति &c. For here the vowels will retain their form by being _pragrihya_ by (VI. I. 125), and in addition to that they will lose their _pluta_, by the present rule. But this is not intended.

The case-ending being elided, the _Sandhi_ takes place. Why do we say 'when by such elision the metre of the line is completed'? Observe स इव व्याघ्रो भवेत् ॥ The word अचि in the _sutra_ is for the sake of distinctness:for the purposes of _metre_ would not have been served by eliding the affix before a consonant, for then the syllables would remain the same. It is by _sandhi_ that a syllable is lessened; and _sandhi_ would take place only with a vowel. Some explain the word पाद as 'a foot of a _Sloka_' also, and according to them this rule is not confined to Vedic metres only. Thus we have:- सैष दाशरथी रामः, सैष राजा युधिष्ठिरः, सैष कर्णो महात्यागी सैष भीमो महाबलः ॥",
    "61135": "This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_ and extends upto (VI. 1. 157). Whatever we shall teach hereafter, in all those, the phrase 'the augment सुट् is placed before the letter क्' should be supplied to complete the sense. Thus (VI. 1. 137) teaches \"After सम्, परि and उप when followed by the verb कृ, the sense being that of adorning\". Here the above phrase should be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense, i. e. \"the augment स् is added before the क् of कृ when it is preceded by सम्, परि and उप, and the sense is that of adorning\". Thus सम् + स् + कृ + तृ = संस्कर्ता, संस्कर्तुम्, संस्कर्तव्यम् ॥ In the succeeding aphorisms it will be seen that the augment सुट् comes only before those roots which begin with क ॥ What is then the necessity of using the phrase कात्पूर्वः in this _sutra_? It is used to indicate that the स् remains unattached to क्, though it stands before it. Thus though कृ becomes स्कृ, yet the latter should not be considered to be a verb beginning with a conjunct (_sanyoga_) consonant:and therefore the _guna_ taught in (VII. 4. 10) (the root ending in ऋ and preceded by a conjunct letter, takes _guna_ before लिट्) does not apply, nor do the rules like (VII. 4. 29), nor the rules ordaining the addition of intermediate इट् (VII. 2. 43) by which the इट् would come in लिङ् and सिच् (Imperfect and Aorist); as, संस्कृषीष्ट and समस्कृत; and so also (VII. 4. 29), does not apply as संस्क्रियते the Passive Imperfect (यकि लिङि) of संस्कृ ॥ If so, then the _anudatta_ accent taught in (VIII. 1. 28) would not take place, since the augment सुट् would intervene between the non-तिङ्-word सं and the तिङन्त word करोति, thus संस्करोति would have accent on the verb. It is a maxim स्वरविधौ व्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् 'in applying a rule relating to accent the intervening consonants are considered as if non-existent'; and therefore सुट् does not offer any intervention to the application of the rule (VIII. 1. 28). If स् is not to be taken as attached to क, how do you explain the _guna_ in the Perfect 3rd Person Dual and Plural in संचस्करतुः and संचस्करुः which apparently is done by applying (VII. 4. 10). Though that rule strictly applies to roots beginning with a conjunct consonant, it will apply also to roots like संस्कृ which have a conjunct consonant for their penultimate; and the _guna_ is done also on the maxim तन्मध्यपतितस्तद् ग्रहणेन गृह्यते (See (VI. 1. 132)). The indicatory ट् in सुट् is for the purpose of differentiating it from सु in the _Sutra_ (VIII. 3. 70).",

It might be said where is the necessity then of this _sutra_? The operation relating to a _Dhatu_ and _Upasarga_ is _Antaranga_, i. e. a root is first joined with the _Upasarga_, and it undergoes other operations afterwards. Therefore, first the augment सुट् is added, and then the अट् and आभ्यास operations take place. Thus संस्कृ is the form to which अट् and अभ्यास operations are to be applied. Now, we have said in the foregoing aphorism, that सुट् is considered as unattached to क; and therefore, the augment अट् may be added after this सुट्, and so also the reduplication may take place without it. Thus we may have the forms like संस्करोत् and संस्चकार ॥ But this is not desired, hence the necessity of the present _sutra_ teaching that even after अट् and reduplicate, the सुट् must be placed before क and no where else.",

To supply by distinct statement the sense of a sentence which is alluded to, is called the अध्याहार of a sentence. Thus in the sense of 'taking pains' we have एधोदकस्योपस्कुरुते (See (I. 3. 32)); काण्डगुणस्योपस्कुरुते ॥ In the sense of 'altering by preparing' we have: उपस्कृतं भुङ्क्ते, उपस्कृतं गच्छति ॥ In the sense of 'supplying a thesis' we have उपस्कृतं जल्पति, उपस्कृतमधीते ॥ When not having any one of the above five senses (VI.

The म् of सम् is optionally elided before ततं, on the strength of the _Karika_:-\"The म् of अवश्यम् is elided before a word ending in a _kritya_ affix, the म् of तुम् is elided before काम and मनस्, the म् of सम् is elided optionally before हित and तत, the final अ of मांस is elided before पाक or पचन ॥ As (1) अवश्य कर्तव्यं = अवश्यकर्तव्यं, (2) भोक्तुम् कामः = भोक्तुम् कामः, श्रोतुमनः ॥ (3) सम्हितं = सहितं, सम् ततं = सततं ॥ (4) मांस् पाकः, मांस् पचनम् ॥",

When it has not the above senses, the form is गोपदम् = गोः पदम् ॥ What is the use of the word असेवित in the _sutra_, the word गोष्पद will give अगोष्पद by adding the negative particle, न गोष्पद = अगोष्पद? The force of नञ् compound is that of सदृश \"like that but not that\". As अब्राह्मण means \"a man who is a _Kshatriya_ &c. not a _Brahmana_, but does not mean a stone &c\". Therefore अगोष्पद with नञ् would mean \"a place like a pasture land but in which cows do not graze, but in which there is a possibility of cows grazing\". But it is intended that it should refer to a place where there is no such possibility, hence असेवित is used. Therefore, deep forests where cows can never enter, are called अगोष्पद ॥",

Observe मकरोग्राहः \"an alligator\", मकरा समुद्र \"an ocean\". Some say the word मकर is a derivative word, being derived from कृ 'to do' with the negative particle मा and the affix अच्, the long आ being shortened. Thus मा क्रियते येन प्रतिषिध्यते = मस्करः 'a bamboo or stick by which the prohibition is made'. So also by adding that इनि in the sense of ताच्छील्य to the root कृ preceded by the _upapada_ मा; we get मस्करिन् ॥ Thus मा करणशाला = मस्करी \"a monk, who has renounced all works\".

This is a _Paribhasha_ or maxim of interpretation with regard to the laws of accent. Wherever an accent-be it acute (_udatta_) or a circumflex (_svarita_) is ordained with regard to a word, there this maxim must be applied, to make all the other syllables of that word unaccented. The word अनुदात्त means 'having an _anudatta_ vowel'. What is the one to be excepted? That one about which any particular accent has been taught in the rules here-in-after given. Thus (VI. I. 162) teaches that a root has acute accent on the final. Therefore, with the exception of the last syllable, all the other syllables are unaccented. Thus in गोपाय꣡ति the acute accent is on य, all the rest are unaccented. The root accent is superseded by आ accent, thus लुना꣡ति has acute accent on ना ॥ The  आ accent is superseded by तस् accent, as लुनीतः꣡, has accent on तः ॥ The तस् accent is superseded by आम् accent, as लुनीतस्तरा꣡म् ॥\n\nआगमस्य विकारस्य प्रकृतेः प्रत्ययस्य च, पृथक् स्वरनिवृत्यर्थमेकवर्जं पदस्वरः ॥ The words 'with the exception of one syllable' show that the separate accent of an augment, or a preparative element, or a stem or an affix should cease, when a particular accent is taught for a word'. Thus as to (1) augment:-(VII. 1. 98) teaches \"आम् acutely accented is the augment of चतुर् and अनडुह् when a _sarvanamasthana_ affix follows\". Thus चत्वा꣡रः, अनड्वा꣡हः, here the augment-accent supersedes the accent of the stem, for च꣡तुर was acutely accented on the first syllable, so also अनडु꣡ह्, these being formed by the affixes उरन् and असुन् respectively. Thus चत् + उरन् = च꣡तुर (चतेरुरन् _Un_ V. 58, accent (VI. 1. 197)); अनडुह् is thus derived : अनो वहति = अनस् + वह् + क्विप्, the स् is replaced by ड्, and there is vocalisation of व् of वह् (VI. I. 15) = अनडु꣡ह् ॥ This word is formed by a _Krit_ affix with a _karaka_ _upapada_, therefore, the second term will retain its original accent, namely the final acute of a root. (VI. 1. 162) and (VI. 2. 139) अनस् itself is derived by adding the affix (_Un_ IV. 189) असुन् which makes the word acutely accented on the first syllable. (2). Similarly as to विकार (_Vikarana_):- (VII. 1. 75) teaches \"instead of अस्थि, दधि, सक्थि, and अक्षि, there shall be आनङ् acutely accented when टा follows or any of the subsequent terminations beginning with a vowel\". This अन will supersede the acute accent of the first अ of the stem: as अस्थ꣡नि ॥ The word अ꣡स्थि is derived from अस् by adding the affix क्थिन् (_Un_ III. 154) which makes the word acutely accented on the first (VI. 1. 197). This is an example of विकार ॥ (3) Similarly in गोपायति the accent of the stem taught in (VI. 1. 162) 'a root has an accent on its final', supersedes the accent of the _vikarana_ आय (III. 1. 28), (III. 1. 3), i. e. the acute accent on आ in आय gives way to the root-accent which makes य acute. (4) So also the accent of the affix supersedes that of the stem : as कर्त्तव्य॑म्, and हर्तव्य॑म्, which are formed by the affix तव्यत् (III. 1. 96) here (VI. 1. 185) debars the accent of the root (VI. 1. 162).\n\nThe determination of the proper accent of a word depends upon considering the various rules that have gone to form it, and the sequence of those rules, e. g. a latter rule (पर) superseding a prior rule, a _nitya_ rule superseding an _anitya_ rule, an _antaranga_ superseding a _bahiranga_, an _apavada_ rule superseding an _utsarga_ rule. But another test is, what is the remaining rule that applies after giving scope to all. A rule, that in spite of another rule, finds scope or activity, bars that former rule. Thus गोपायति ॥ It is derived from गु꣡प् root, which as a root has accent on the syllable गु (VI. 1. 162). When the affix आय is added to it by (III. 1. 28), the word becomes गोपा꣡य and it takes the accent of the affix (III. 1. 3), i. e. the accent now falls on पा; but now comes rule (III. 1. 32) which says that a word taking the affix आय is a root. Thus गोपाय꣡ gets the designation of root (धातु), and thus takes the accent of a _dhatu_ (VI. 1. 162), and the accent falls on य ॥\n\nThe rule is that except one special accent taught in a _sutra_ the other syllables take _anudatta_. Therefore, where there is a conflict of rules, the accent is guided by the follwing maxim: \"परनित्यान्तरङ्गापवादैः स्वरैर्व्यवस्था सति प्रकृतिशिष्ठेन च\" namely (1) the sequence, a succeeding rule setting aside a prior rule (2) a _Nitya_ rule is stronger then _Anitya_, (3) _Antaranga_ stronger than _Bahiranga_, ( 4 ) the _Apavada_ is stronger then _Utsarga_. When all these are exhausted, as we have illustrated above, then we apply the rule of सतिशिष्ठ ॥ What is this rule? To quote the words of _Kasika_: यो हि यस्मिन् सति शिष्यते स तस्य बाधको भवति \"that which does remain and must last in spite of the presence of another, debars such other\". Thus in गोपायति; here the प्रत्ययस्वरः \"the accent of the affix\" (III. 1. 3) by which the acute is on the first syllable of the affix is an _apavada_ to the धातुस्वरः (VI. 1. 192) by which the final of a _dhatu_ is acute, and it debars the _dhatu_-accent; but this affix-accent is in its turn debarred in the case of derivative verbs formed with affixes, by the rule of सतिशिष्ठ, because even after the addition of the affix, these words retain the designation of _dhatu_. Similarly in कार्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गपुत्रः, \"The son of him whose upper garment (_uttarasanga_) is of black color--the Son of _Baladeva_\" the _Bahuvrihi_-accent (VI. 2. 1) being an _apavada_ to _Samasa_-accent (VI. 1. 223), debars the _samasa_-accent; but this _Bahuvrihi_-accent is in its turn debarred by the rule of सतिशिष्ठ when a further compound is formed and the final word is a compound only and not a _Bahuvrihi_. Though the accent of the _Vikarana_ is a सतिशिष्ठ, yet it does not debar the _Sarvadhatuka_ accent (VI. 1. 186). Thus in लुनीतः, the accent of the _vikarana_ नी does not debar the accent of तस् ॥\n\nVart:- The नञ् accent is stronger than the case-affix accent. Thus in अतिस्रः, here the accent of जस् _vibhakti_ after तिसृ (VI. 1. 166) though सतिशिष्ठ is debarred by नञ् accent taught in (VI. 2. 2), for Negative compounds are _Tatpurusha_.\n\nVart:- The accent of नञ् is stronger than the accent of that which is caused or occasioned by a _vibhakti_. Thus अचत्वारः ॥  Here the augment आम् in चत्वार is occasioned because of the case-affix, for it is added only then when a _Sarvanama_ case-affix follows (VII. 1. 98). This आ is _udatta_ (VI. 1. 98). But this _udatta_ is superseded by the accent of the Negative particle.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the body of a _pada_'? In a sentence, every word will retain its accent. As देव꣡दत्त ! गा꣡मभ्याज शुक्ला꣡म् \"_O_ _Devadatta_, drive away the white cow\". The word पद is in fact used in this _sutra_ in its secondary sense, namely that which will get the designation of पद when completed; had it meant the full ready made _pada_, this word would not have been repeated in पदाधिकार _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 16), (VIII. 1. 17). Had a full '_pada_' been meant, the incongruity would arise in the following. The word कु꣡वल is acutely accented on the first as belonging to ग्रामादि class (_Phit_ II. 15), adding the feminine affix ङीष् to it by its belonging to ग्रामादि class, we get कुवली, which will retain its acute on the first because it is not technically a पद ॥ But it is not so, the word कुवली has _anudatta_ accent on the first syllable (_Phit_ II. 15), and hence we can apply the अञ् affix to it by (IV. 2. 44), thus कुवल्या विकारः = कौवलम् ॥ Similarly the word गर्भिणी formed from ग꣡र्भ (belonging to _Gramadi_ class _Phit_ II. 15), with, the affix इनि (V. 2. 115) and the feminine ङीप् ॥ If here the affix इनि being _udatta_ causes all the rest syllables _anudatta_, just at the very moment of its application, without seeing whether the word was a _pada_ or not, then the word गर्भिणी being _anudattadi_ would have taken अञ्, and therefore its exception is proper in the भिक्षादि class (IV. 2. 38). But if the _anudatta_-hood of the remaining syllables were to follow after a word had got the designation of पद, then the word गर्भिणी would remain acutely accented on the first, and its enumeration in (IV. 2. 38) would be useless.",
    "61159": "Thus कर्षः꣡, पाकः꣡, त्यागः꣡, रागः꣡, दायः꣡, धायः꣡ ॥ This is an exception to (VI. 1. 197) by which affixes having an indicatory ञ् have acute accent on the first syllable. The word कर्ष is used in the aphorism instead of कृष्, to indicate that कृष of _Bhvadi_ _gana_ is affected by this rule, and not कृष् – कृषति of _Tudadigana_. The word क꣡र्षः derived from _Tudadi_ कृष् has acute accent on the first syllable.",
    "61160": "Thus 1. उञ्छः꣡, 2. म्लेच्छः꣡, 3. जञ्जः꣡, 4. जल्पः꣡ ॥ These are formed by घञ्, and would have taken acute-accent on the first. 5. जपः꣡, 6. वधः꣡ are formed by अप् affix (III. 3. 61) which being grave (III. 1. 4), these words would have taken the accent of the _dhatu_ (VI. 1. 162), i. e. acute on the first syllable. Some read व्यधः꣡ also here. 7. युगः꣡ is derived from युज् by घञ् affix, the non-causing of _guna_ is irregular, and the word means 'a cycle of time', 'a part of a carriage'. In other senses, the form is योगः꣡ ॥ 8. गरः꣡ = (दूष्ये); is formed by अप्, and has this accent when it means 'poison', in other senses, the acute is on the first syllable. 9. वेगः꣡, वेदः꣡, वेष्टः꣡ (चेष्टः), and बन्धः꣡, करणे ॥ These words are formed by घञ् by (III. 3. 121). When denoting instrument (करण) they take the above accent, when denoting भाव the accent falls on the first syllable. 10. स्तुयुद्रुवश्छन्दसि, e.g. परिष्टु꣡त्, परिद्रु꣡त्, संयु꣡त् ॥ 11. वर्त्तनिः स्तोत्रे, the _stotra_ means _Sama_ _Veda_, the word व॒॒र्त्त॒॒निः꣡ occurring in the _Sama_ _Veda_ has acute on the last : in other places, it has the accent on the middle. 12. श्वभ्रे दरः, the दरः꣡ has end-acute when meaning 'a cave', otherwise when formed by अप् affix it has acute on the first. 13. साम्बतापौ भावगर्हायाम्, thus सा॒॒म्बः꣡, ता॒॒पः꣡, in other senses, the acute is on the first. 14. उत्तमशश्वत्तमौ सर्वत्र, e.g. उ॒॒त्त॒॒मः꣡, श॒॒श्व॒॒त्त॒॒मः꣡ ॥  Some read the limitation of भावगर्हा into this also. 15. भक्षमन्थभोगमन्थाः (भोगदेहा) ॥ These are formed by घञ्, भक्ष though a ण्यन्त root is here घञन्तं ॥ \n\n1 उञ्छ, 2 म्लेच्छ, 3 जञ्ज, 4 जल्प, 5 जप, 6 वध (व्यध), 7 युग, 8 गरो दूष्ये, 9 वेदवेगवेष्टबन्धाः, (चेष्ट वेष्ट) करणे, 10 स्तुयुद्रुवश्छन्दसि (परिष्टुत्, संयुत्, परिद्रुत्), 11 वर्तनिः स्तोत्रे 12 श्वभ्रे दरः, 13 साम्बतापौ भावगर्हायाम्, 14 उत्तमशश्वत्तमौ (उत्तमशश्वत्तमशब्दौ) सर्वत्र, 15 भक्षमन्थः,  भोगमन्थाः (भक्षमन्थभोगदेहाः) ॥",
    "61161": "The word _udatta_ is understood here. Thus कुमार꣡ + ई॒॒ = कुमा॒॒री꣡ ॥ The word कुमार has acute on the last, when the unaccented (_anudatta_) ङीप् is added to it, the अ꣡ is elided (VI. 1. 148), the _anudatta_ ई॒॒ becomes _udatta_. So also प॒॒थिन्꣡ + श॒॒स् = प॒॒थः꣡ (VII. 1. 88), प॒॒थिन् + ए॒॒ = प॒॒थे, प॒॒थिन् + आ॒॒ = प॒॒था꣡ ॥ The पथिन् has acute on the last. So also कुमुद + ड्मतुप् = कुमुद्वा꣡न् (IV. 2. 87), न॒॒ड्व꣡त्, वे॒॒तस्वत् ॥ The words कुमुद &c, are end-acute, and the affix मत् (वत्) is _anudatta_ (III. 1. 4).\n\nWhy 'an _anudatta_ vowel gets &c'. Observe प्रा॒॒सङ्गः + य॑त् = प्रासङ्ग्यः ॥ (प्रासङ्गं वहति (IV. 4. 76)). Here though प्रसङ्ग꣡ is end-acute (VI. 2. 144) formed by घञ् with __gati_)) it is followed by य॑ which is _svarita_ (VI. 1. 185), this _svarita_ causes the _lopa_ of अ꣡ _udatta_: but it does not itself become _udatta_. No, this is not a proper counter-example. For by the general rule of accent (VI. 1. 158), when one syllable is ordained to be _udatta_ or _svarita_, all the other syllables of that word become _anudatta_. Therefore when य॑ is taught to be _svarita_, all the other syllables (like ङ्ग꣡) will become _anudatta_. So there is no _lopa_ of _udatta_ when य॑ comes. The word अनुदात्त is used to indicate that the initial _anudatta_ becomes _udatta_. Had _anudatta_ not been used, the _sutra_ would have been यत्रोदात्तलोपश्च, which would mean यस्मिन् प्रत्यये परत; उदात्तालुप्यते तस्यान्त उदात्तो भवति, for the _anuvritti_ of अन्त would then be read from the last. There would then be anomaly in the case of मा हि धुक्षाताम्, and माहि धुक्षाथाम् ॥ From the root दुह we have formed धुक्षाताम् and धुक्षाथाम् in the Aorist Atmanepada_, dual. दुह् + क्स꣡ + आताम् = दुह् + स् (VII. 3.72) + आताम् ॥ Here आताम् causes the elision of the _udatta_ अ of स ॥ Therefore the final of आता꣡म् would be _udatta_, which is not desired. The augment अ is not added because of मा, had it been added, the अ꣡ would have been _udatta_ (VI. 4. 71). Had हि not been given, then also the whole of धुक्षाताम् would have become _anudatta_ in माधुक्षाताम् because of तिङ्ङतिङः (VIII. 1. 28). See (VIII. 1. 34) (हि च). Why have we used the word यत्र in the _sutra_? If it was not employed, then the subsequent _anudatta_ may be such which would not have caused the elision of the previous _udatta_; such _udatta_ being elided by some other operator, and still such _anudatta_ would have become _udatta_. Thus in भार्गवः, भार्गवौ, भृगवः ॥ Here भृगवः is plural of भार्गवः ॥ The word भार्गव is end-acute and this acute (अण्) was elided in the plural, before the affix जस् was added. The elision here is not caused by जस्, but is a subject of जस् (not निमित्त but विषय). Therefore जस् does not become _udatta_, which would have been the case, had यत्र not been used. प्राक् सुबुत्पत्ते गोत्रप्रत्ययस्य लुक् ॥ The _gotra_ affix was elided prior to the adding of the case-ending. Why do we say \"when an _udatta_ is elided\"? Observe बिद + अञ् (IV. 1. 104) = ब꣡द ॥ The feminine of this will be बैद꣡ + ङीन् (IV. 1. 73) = बैदी꣡ ॥ Here ई causes the elision of _anudatta_ अ of द, and hence remains unchanged. So also आ꣡ र्वी ॥",
    "61162": "The word अन्त is understood here. Thus प꣡चति, प꣡ठति, ऊर्णो꣡ति, गोपाय꣡ति, या꣡ति ॥",
    "61163": "Thus भंगुर꣡म्, भासुर꣡म्, मेदुर꣡म्. These are formed by घुरच् (III. 2. 161). So also कुण्डिनाः by (II. 4. 70) where the substitute कुण्डिनच् is employed. To कुण्ड is added इनि in the sense of मतुप्, then is added the feminine affix ङीप्, thus कुण्डि꣡नी has middle-acute. The descendants of _Kundini_ will be काण्डिन्यः (by यञ् of _Gargadi_). The plural of _Kaundinya_ will be formed by eliding यञ् and substituting कुण्डिनच for the remaining portion. In the cases of affixes having an indicatory च, the acute accent falls on the final, taking the stem and the affix in an aggregate. Thus बहुपटुः꣡ ॥ The affix बहुच् is one of those few affixes which are really prefixes. (V. 3. 68), The accent will not, therefore, fall on हु, but on the last syllable of the whole word compounded of the prefix + the base. So also with the affix अकच्. It is added in the middle of the word, but the accent will fall on the end; as उच्चैकः꣡ (V. 3. 71).",
    "61164": "Thus काञ्जायनाः꣡ formed by the affix च्फञ् (IV. 1. 98). कुञ्ज + च् फञ् + ञ्य = कौ꣡ञ्जायन्यः dual कौ꣡ञ्जायन्यौ, plural कौञ्जायनाः꣡ (ञ्य being elided by (II. 4. 62), and thus giving scope to च्फञ् accent). In this affix there are two indicatory letters च and ञ; the च has only one function, namely, regulating the accent according to this rule, while ञ has two functions, one to regulate accent by (VI. 1. 197), and another to cause _Vriddhi_ by (VII. 2. 117). Now arises the question, should the word get the accent च or of ञ ॥ The present rule declares that it should get the accent of च and not of ञ, for the latter finds still a function left to it, while if ञ was to regulate the accent, च would have no scope.",

    "61166": "Thus ति॒॒स्र꣡स्तिष्ठन्ति ॥ This debars the _Svarita_ accent ordained by (VIII. 2. 4) The word तिसृ (feminine of त्रि (VII. 2. 99) meaning 'three' is always plural. There are singular or dual cases of this numeral; of the seven plural cases, the accusative plural will have acute on the final by (VI. 1. 174); the remaining cases (Instrumental, Dative, Ablative, Genitive and Locative) have affixes beginning with a consonant, and by (VI. 1. 179) they will be _udatta_. Thus the only case not covered by any special rule is जस् (nominative plural); which would have been _Svarita_, but for this rule. If जस् be the only case not provided for, then merely saying तिसृभ्यः would have sufficed to make the rule applicable to जस् only, why has then it been employed in the _sutra_? This is done, in order that in compounds, where तिसृ may come as a subordinate member, and where singular and dual endings will also be added, this rule will not apply. Had जस् been not used in this _sutra_, then in the case of simple तिसृ there would be no harm, but when it is second member in a compound there would be anomaly. Thus अतितिस्रौ would have become end-acute. But that is not desired. It is _svarita_ on the final by (VIII. 2. 4).",
    "61167": "Thus च॒॒तु꣡रः पश्य the accent is on तु ॥ The feminine of चतुर् is चतसृ (VII. 2. 99), which has acute accent on the first (VII. 2. 99) _Vartika_)), and its accusative plural will not have accent on the last syllable. This is so, because चतुर् has acute on the first, as formed by उरन् affix. Its substitute चतसृ will also be so, by the rule of स्थानिवत् ॥ The special enunciation of आद्युदात्त with regard to चतसृ in the _Vartika_ चतसर्याद्युदात्तनिपातनं कर्तव्यं (VII. 2. 99) indicates that the present rule does not apply to चतसृ ॥ Another reason for this is as follows: चतसृ + शस् = चतसृ + शस् ॥ Now comes the present _Sutra_; here, however, the र् substitute of ऋ being _sthanivat_, will prevent the _udatta_ formation of the अ of त; nor will ऋ be considered as final and take the acute, as there exists no vowels ऋ but a consonant र् which cannot take an accent. As चतस्रः पश्य ॥ Professor Bohtlingk places the accent thus चतुरः꣡, Professor Max Muller चतु꣡रः ॥ I have followed Professor Max Muller in interpreting this _sutra_; for Bohtlingk's interpretation would make the ending शस् accented, and not the final of चतुर् ॥",

According to (VI. 1. 223), the compounds have acute accent on the final: that rule applies in the alternative when the case-affixes are not acute and gives us\nthe alternative forms. Why do we say 'is acutely accented on the final'? Observe अ꣡वाचा, सु꣡वाचा, सु꣡त्वचा ॥ These are _Tatpurusha_ compounds and by (VI. 2. 2). the first term of the compound retains its original accent. Why have we used the word 'standing at the end of a compound' when the word नित्यसमासे indicated that the compound was meant ? Had we not used the word उत्तरपदात्, the aphorism would have stood as, अन्तोदात्तादन्यतरस्यामनित्यसमासे 'In a loose-compound having acute on the final, the above affixes are acute, if the compound consists of a monosyllable'. The word एकाचः will thus qualify the compound and not the second member of the compound, which is intended. And thus the rule will apply to श्वोर्क् (शुन ऊर्क्) Instrumental श्वोर्जा, श्वोर्जेः &c, and not to compounds having more than one syllable. Why do we say 'in loose compounds'? Observe अग्नि॒॒चि꣡ता, सो॒॒मसु꣡ता ॥ These words form invariable (_nitya_) compounds by (II. 2. 19), and by (VI. 2. 139), the second member retains its original accent, which makes चि _udatta_.",

This rule debars it. The use of दीर्घात् indicates that the word अष्टन् has two forms, and the substitution of long अ taught in (VII. 2. 84), thus becomes optional, because of this indication. Otherwise the employment of the word दीर्घात् would be useless, for by (VII. 2. 84) which is couched in general terms, अष्टन् would always end in a long vowel. There is another use of the word दीर्घात्, namely, it makes the word अष्टान् with long आ (VII. 2. 84) to get also the designation of षट् ॥ For if अष्टान् was not to be called a षट्, like अष्टन्, then there would be scope to the present _sutra_ in the case of अष्टान् while it would be debarred in the case of अष्टन् without long आ, by the subsequent rule (VI.

Observe पंचाना꣡म्, सप्तानाम् ॥\nWhy do we say 'the penultimate syllable'? Observe षड्भिः꣡, षड्भ्यः꣡ ॥",
    "61181": "The झलादि case-affixes coming after the above numerals षट्, त्रि and चतुर् may make the words so formed take the acute on the penultimate optionally, in the spoken ordinary language. Thus पंच꣡भिः or पंचभिः꣡ ॥ In the alternative (VI. 1. 179) applies. So also सप्तभिः or सप्तभिः꣡, तिसृ꣡भिः or तिसृभिः꣡ ॥",
    "61182": "Thus ग꣡वा, ग꣡वे, गो꣡भ्याम् ॥ Here by (VI. 1. 168), the case-endings would have got otherwise the accent, which is however prohibited. So also सुगु꣡ना, सुग꣡वे and सुगु꣡भ्याम् ॥ Here (VI. 1. 169) is prohibited. So also शु꣡ना, शु꣡ने, श्व꣡भ्याम्, परमशु꣡ना, परमशुन and परमश्व꣡भ्याम् ॥ The word साववर्णः (सौ अवर्णः) means \"what has अ or आ before सु (Ist. singular)\" Thus ये꣡भ्यः, ते꣡भ्यः, के꣡भ्यः ॥ राज् :- रा꣡जा, रा꣡जे, पररा꣡जा ॥ (The word राज is formed by क्विप् affix): अङ् = अञ्च् + क्विन्; the prohibition applies to that form of this word wherein the nasal is not elided (VI. 4. 30). Thus प्रा꣡ञ्चा, प्रा꣡ङ्भ्याम् ॥ Where the nasal is elided, there the case-ending must take the accent; as प्रा॒॒चा꣡, प्रा॒॒चे꣡, प्रा॒॒ग्भ्या꣡म् ॥ क्रुङ् is also a क्विन् formed word. Thus क्रु꣡ञ्चा, क्रु꣡ञ्चे, परमक्रु꣡ञ्चा ॥ कृत् is derived from कृ 'to do' or from कृत् 'to cut' by क्विप्; as कृ꣡ता कृ꣡ते and परमकृ꣡ता ॥ Why has the word श्वन् been especially mentioned in this _sutra_, when the rule would have applied to it without such enumeration, because in the Nominative Singular this word assumes the form श्वा and consequently it is साववर्णः? The inclusion of श्वन् indicates that the elision of न should not be considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of this rule. Therefore, the present rule will not apply to words like नृ and पितृ which in Nominative Singular end in आ, as ना and पिता after the elision of न् of अनड् (VII. 3. 94). Thus the Locative Singular of नृ will be नरि by (VI. 1. 168), this prohibition not applying, and the affix मतुप् will get _udatta_ after पिता by (VI. I. 176) as पितृमा꣡न् ॥ But rule (VI. I. 176) will be debarred by the present in the case of वृक्ष꣡वान् because वृक्ष is a साववर्ण ॥",
    "61183": "Thus द्यु꣡भ्याम्, द्꣡युभिः ॥ This debars (VI. 1. 168), (VI. 1. 171). Why do we say 'beginning with a झल् consonant'? Observe दिवा꣡, दिवे꣡ ॥",
    "61184": "Thus नृ꣡भिः or नृभिः꣡, नृभ्यः꣡, नृभ्यः꣡, नृ꣡भ्याम्, नृभ्या꣡म् , नृ꣡षु, नृषु꣡ ॥ But not so श्रा꣡, त्रे꣡ ॥",
    "61185": "Thus चिकी॒॒र्ष्य॑म्, जिही॒॒र्ष्य॑म्, formed by यत् (III. 1. 97). कार्य॑म्, हार्य॑म् with ण्यत् (III. I. 124). This is an exception to (III. I. 3) which makes all affixes _adyudatta_. For exception to this rule see (VI. I. 213) &c.",
    "61186": "Thus तासि :- कर्त्ता꣡, कर्त्ता꣡रौ, कर्त्ता꣡रः, this debars the affix accent (III. I. 3). _Anudattet_ :-as, आस् - आ꣡स्ते, वस् - व꣡स्ते ॥ डित् :- षूङ् - सू꣡ते, शीङ् - शेते ॥ अत् उपदेशः :- as तु꣡दतः, नु꣡दतः, प꣡चतः, प꣡ठतः ॥ A root taking शप् (अ) is considered as taught (_upadesa_) as if ending with an अ, as the indicatory letters श् and प् are disregarded on the maxim अनुबन्धस्यानैकान्तिकत्वं (= अनवयवत्वं) ॥ Thus प꣡चमानः, य꣡जमानः ॥ The augment मुक is added by आने मुक् (VII. 2. 82) which may be explained in two ways; first, the augment मुक् is added to the final अ of the base (_anga_) when आन (आनच् &c) follows; or secondly, the the augment मुक् is added to the base (_anga_) which ends in अ, when आन follows. In the first case मुक् becomes part and parcel of अ and will be taken and included by the enunciation of अ, and therefore अदुपदेश will mean and include an अ having such मुक्, as on the maxim यदागमास्तद्गुणीभूतास्तद्ग्रहणेन गृह्यन्ते \"That to which an augment is added denotes, because the augment forms part of it, not merely itself, but it denotes also whatever results from its combination with that augment\". Therefore मुक् will not prevent the verb becoming अदुपदेश ॥ But if secondly मुक् be taken as part of the base which ends in अ, then the लसार्वधातुक does not follow an अदुपदेश, because म intervenes. But we get rid of this difficulty by considering मुक् augment as _Bahiranga_ and therefore _asiddha_, when the _Antaranga_ operation of accent is to be performed. The augment मुक् (म्) in the last two examples consequently does not prevent the application of the rule. Though the affix शानच् has an indicatory च्, yet चित् accent (VI. 1. 163) is debarred by this rule, as it is subsequent.\n\nWhy do we say after तासि &c. Observe चिनुतः꣡ चिन्वन्तिः꣡ ॥ The _vikarana_ श्नु is ङित् (I. 2. 4) with regard to operations affecting the prior term, and not those which affect the subsequent. Therefore though श्नु is considered as ङित् for the purposes of preventing the _guna_ of the prior term चि, it will not be considered so for the purposes of subsequent accent. Or the word ङित् in this _sutra_ may be taken as equal to ङिदुपदेश and not the आतिदेशिक ङित् like श्नु ॥ Why do we use the word _upadesa_ ? So that the rule may apply to प꣡चावः, प꣡चामः, but not to हतः, हथः the dual of हन् which ends in न् in _upadesa_. though before तस् and थस् it has assumed the form ह ॥ Therefore ह॒॒तः꣡, ह॒॒थः꣡ ॥ Why do we use the word ल (Personal endings)? Observe कतीह प꣡चमाना formed by शानन् added to पू (III. 2. 128), which not being a substitute of लट्, is not a personal ending like शानच् ॥ Why do we use the word _Sarvadhatuka_ ? Observe, शिश्ये꣡, शिश्य꣡ति, शिश्यि꣡रे ॥ Why do we say with the exception of ह्नुङ् and इङ् ? Observe ह्नु॒॒ते꣡, यद् अधीते ॥",
    "61187": "The word उदात्त is understood here. Thus मा हि का꣡र्ष्टाम्, मा हि कार्ष्टा꣡म्; मा हि ला꣡विष्टाम् or मा हि लाविष्टा꣡म् ॥ In the last example the accent is on पि; and the reason why मा and हि are used in these illustrations, has already been explained in (VI. I. 161). The indicatory च् of सिच् the shows that by (VI. 1. 163) the acute will be on the otherwise unaccented augment इट्, when it takes this augment. The सिच् being a वलादि affix will take the augment इट् (VII. 2. 35), and it is a general rule that augments are unaccented; so in the above the वि would have been unaccented, and the accent would have been on the final, but for the indicatory च् of सिच्, which otherwise would find no scope. Thus वि gets acute.\n\nVart:- An affix having an indicatory प् (पित्) when coming after an Aorist by सिच् without the augment इट् (अनिट् सिच्) is in one alternative _udatta_ (in the other, it is non-acute). This _vartika_ restricts the scope of the _sutra_ with regard to पित् affixes. Thus we get the following two forms, which otherwise would have one form only by _dhatu_-accent, namely, acute on the first, for पित् is _anudatta_. Thus माहि का꣡र्षम् or मा हि कार्ष꣡म् ॥ But when it takes the इट् augment, there are two forms (Ist.) मा हि ला꣡विषम् as a तिङन्त, (2nd.) मा हि लाविष꣡म् accent on वि (VI. 1. 163). but never मा हि लाविष꣡म् ॥ When however the augment अ is added, the accent falls on this augment (VI. 4. 71).",

Thus स्व꣡पन्ति or स्वप꣡न्ति, श्व꣡सन्ति or श्वस꣡न्ति, हिं꣡सन्ति or हिंस꣡न्ति ॥ The accent on the middle falls by the accent of the affix (III. 1. 3). Why do we say 'before an affix beginning with a vowel'? Observe स्वप्या꣡त्, हिंस्या꣡त् ॥ Why do we say 'not taking the augment इट्?' Observe स्वपितः꣡ and श्वसितः꣡ ॥ This rule applies to those vowel-beginning affixes which are ङित्; it does not apply to स्व꣡पानि, हिन꣡सानि ॥",

Thus द꣡दाति, ज꣡हाति, द꣡धाति, जि꣡हीते, मि꣡मीते ॥ The word अनुदात्त is to be construed here as a _Bahuvrihi_ i. e. an affix in which there is no _udatta_ vowel, so that the rule may apply when a portion of the affix is elided or a semivowel is substituted : as मा हि द꣡धात्, and दधा꣡त्यत्र ॥",
    "61191": "Thus सर्वः, सर्वाः꣡ स꣡र्वे ॥ Why do we say when the case-endings follow? Observe सर्व꣡तरः, सर्व꣡तमः the acute is on र्व ॥ The word सर्व has acute on the final, as it is so taught in the _Unadi_ list by निपातन् ॥ It thus being _anudattadi_ takes the affix अञ् and forms सार्वः (सर्वस्य विकारः) This rule applies even when the case affix is elided in spite of the prohibition of न लुमताङ्गस्य (I. I.63): as स꣡र्वस्तोमः ॥\n\nVart:- The rule does not apply when the affix अकच् is put in : as सर्वकः꣡ ॥ Here the accent is on the final by चित् accent (VI. I. 163).",

Thus बिभे꣡ति, जिहे꣡ति, बिभ꣡र्त्ति, जुहो꣡ति, मम꣡त्तु नः परिज्मा ॥ Here the root मद has diversely taken in the _Chhandas_ the _vikarana_ श्लु, though it belongs to _Divadi_ class. जज꣡नत्, इन्द्रम् ॥ The verb is here लेट् or the Vedic Subjunctive, so also is the next example. दधनत् from धन धान्ये, the इ of ति being elided by (III. 4. 97). and the augment अट् being added by (III. 4. 94). दध꣡नत्, दरिद्रा꣡ति, जाग꣡र्त्ति ॥ In the case of other verbs we have द꣡दाति ॥ Before affixes which have not the indicatory प् (i. e. all endings other than the three singular endings), the accent will be on the first syllable: as द꣡रिद्रति ॥",

    "61194": "Thus लो꣡लूयम् or लोलू꣡यम् ॥ In the reduplicate form लोलू, the second part लू is unaccented by (VIII. 1. 3). The present _sutra_ makes लो accented. When लो is not accented, लू will get the accent by लित् accent. This rule is confined to polysyllabic Absolutives, namely to reduplicated Absolutives (VIII. I. 4).",

Thus लू꣡यते or लूय꣡ते केदारः स्वयमेव ॥ स्ती꣡र्यते or स्तीर्य꣡ते केदारः स्वयमेव ॥ When the accent does not fall on the first syllable, it falls on य (VI. I. 186). This rule applies to जन्, खन् , and सन् when they get the form जायते, सायते and खायते; the long आ (VI. 4. 43) substitute is considered as if these verbs were taught in the _Dhatupatha_ with long आ ॥ Thus जा꣡यते or जाय꣡ते स्वयमेव सा꣡यते or सा꣡यते स्वयमेव; खा꣡यते or खाय꣡ते स्वयमेय ॥ Why do we say 'when ending in a vowel'?

    "61196": "Thus लु꣡लविथ, लुल꣡विथ, लुलविथ꣡, and लुलविथ꣡. As थल् has an indicatory ल्, the syllable preceding the affix may have also the accent (VI. 1. 193). Thus we get the four forms given above. In short, with इथ termination, the accent may fall on any syllable. When the थ is not सेट्, the accent falls on the root and we have one form only by लिट् accent (VI. 1. 193) :- ययाथ ॥",

When the affixes are, however, elided, the word loses this accent, i. e. the affix does not leave its mark behind, as it generally does by (I. 1. 62). Therefore गर्गाः꣡, बिदाः꣡, चञ्चाः꣡ having lost यञ्, अञ् and कन्, have lost their accent also.",

This allows an option. The word इन्धान, if it is formed by चानश् it will have the accent on the final. If it is considered to be formed by शानच्, the affix being a _sarvadhatuka_ is _anudatta_, and as it replaces _udatta_ final of the root, it becomes _udatta_ (VI. 1. 161), and thus इन्धान gets acute on the middle.

Then the rule would apply to राजवती also, for this word is really that राजन्वती ending in अन्वती, the subsequent elision of न् is held to be non-valid for the purposes of the application of this rule (VIII. 2. 2). But the change of म into व (मत् = वत्) is considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of this rule.",

The exceptions to this rule will be mentioned in the next chapter.",
    "62001": "The word पूर्वपदम् means here the accent-whether _udatta_ or _svarita_ - which is in the first member: प्रकृत्या means, retains its own nature, does not become modified into an _anudatta_ accent. By the rule (VI. 1. 223), the final of a compound gets the accent, so that all the preceding members lose their accent and become _anudatta_, as in one word all syllables are unaccented except one. (VI. 5. 158). Thus the first member of a _Bahuvrihi_ would have lost its accent and become _anudatta_; with the present _sutra_ commences the exceptions to the rule that the final of a compound is always, _udatta_. Thus का꣡र्ष्णोत्तरासङ्गाः ॥ The word कार्ष्ण is derived by the _Taddhita_ affix अञ् (IV. 3. 154) from कृष्ण 'a kind of antelope;' and has the ञित् accent (VI. 1. 197) i. e. on the first syllable: which the word preserves in the compound also. So also यू꣡पवलजः; the word यूप is derived from  यु by the _Unadi_ affix प (_Unadi_ III. 27.), before which the vowel becomes lengthened (_Unadi_ III. 25) and the affix is treated as नित् (_Unadi_ III. 26), and hence the word is acutely accented on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197). So also ब्रह्मचारि꣡ परिस्कन्दः; the word ब्रह्मचारिन् has a _Krit_ formed word as its second part, and gets the acute on the final (VI. 2. 139). So also स्ना꣡तकपुत्रः, the word स्नातक is derived by कन् (V. 4. 29) affix and has नित् accent (VI. 1. 197) i. e. _udatta_ on the first syllable. So also अध्या꣡पकपुत्रः, the word अध्यापक is accented on the middle as it is formed by a लित् affix (III. 1. 133), (VI. 1. 193). श्रो꣡त्रियपुत्रः, the श्रोत्रिय being enounced with an indicatory न् in _Sutra_ (V. 2. 84) is acutely accented on the first. मनुष्य॑नाथः, the word मनुष्य being formed by यत् (IV. 1. 161) a तित् affix is _svarita_ (VI. 1. 185).\n\nThe words _udatta_ and _svarita_ are understood in this aphorism. Therefore if all the syllables of the _purvapada_ are _anudatta_, the present rule has no scope there, and such a compound will get _udatta_ on the final by the universal rule enunciated in (VI. 1. 223). Thus समभागः꣡, here सम being all _anudatta_, the accent falls on ग ॥",
    "62002": "Thus (1) तुल्यश्वेतः, तुल्यलोहित, तुल्यमहान्, सदृक्च्छ्वेतः, सदृग्लोहितः सदृग्महान् ॥ These are _Karmadharaya_ compounds formed under (II. 1. 68): and तुल्य being formed by यत् is acutely accented on the first (VI. 1. 216). The word सदृक् is formed by क्विन् (III. 2. 60) _Vartika)), and has acute on the final (VI. 1. 197) and (VI. 2. 139). So also सदृशश्वेतः सदृशलोहितः, सदृशमहान् ॥ The word सदृश is formed by कञ् added to दृश्, and by (VI. I. 197) the accent falls on दृ (VI. 2. 139). (2) When the first member is in the Instrumental case, as :- शंकुलया खण्डः = शंकुलाखण्डः, so also किरिकाणः (II. I. 30) शंकुला is derived from शंकु + ला ॥ To the root ला is added the affix क with the force of घञ्, and thus the noun ला is _udatta_, or the whole word शंकुला is a word formed by क affix and hence (VI. 1. 165) applies and is final-acute. किरिः is formed by the _Unadi_ affix इ to कृ (_Unadi_ IV. 143), and it being treated as a कित् (_Unadi_. IV. 142) has _udatta_ on the final.\n\n(3) When the first member is a word in the Locative case, as :- अक्षेषु शौण्डः = अक्षशौण्डः, so also पानशौण्डः ॥ The word अक्ष is formed by the affix त added to अश् (_Un_ III. 65), and is final acute (III. 1. 3). The word पान is formed by ल्यूट् affix added to पा, and is acute on the first (VI. 1. 193) owing to the लित् accent. (4) When the first member is a word with which the second member is compared, as:- शस्त्रीश्यामा, कुमुदश्येनी, हंसगद्गदा, न्यग्रोधपरिमण्डला, दूर्वाकाण्डश्यामा, शरकाण्डगौरी ॥ These compounds are formed by (II. 1. 55). शस्त्री is formed by ङीप् and is final-acute; कुमुद is formed by क affix (कौ मोदते = कुमुद) see (III. 2. 5). _Vartika_)): and is acutely accented on the first, or by _Phit_ _sutra_ II. 3 it has acute on the first. हंस is formed by the _Unadi_ affix स added to हन् (_Unadi_ III. 62), and is finally accented (III. 1. 3). न्यग्रोहति = न्यग्रोधः formed by अच् (III. 1. 134), and ह is irregularly changed into ध as _Panini_ himself uses this form (VII. 3. 5): and it is accented in the middle. The words दूर्वाकाण्ड, शरकाण्ड are Genitive _Tatpurusha_, and their second member has accent on the first syllable (VI. 2. 135), (5) When the first member is an Indeclinable, as, अब्राह्मणः, अवृषलः, कुब्राह्मणः, कुवृषलः ॥ निष्कौशाम्बिः, निर्वाराणासिः, अतिखट्वः, अतिमालः ॥ All these Indeclinable compounds have _udatta_ on the first, they are formed by (II. 2. 5) &c.\n\nVart:- In cases of Indeclinable compounds, the rule applies only to those which are formed by the negative Particle अ, by कु, and by Particles (_nipata_). Though नञ्, is one of the _Nipatas_, its separate mention indicates that नञ्-accent debars even the subsequent कृत्-accent as अकरणिः ॥ Therefore, it does not apply here स्नात्वाकालकः which has acute on the final and belongs to _Mayuravyansakadi_ class.\n\n(6) When the first member as in the accusative case, as:- मुहूर्त्तसुखम्, मुहूर्त्तरमणीयम्, सर्वरात्रकल्याणी, सर्वरात्रशोभना ॥ They are formed by (II. 1. 29). मुहूर्त्त belongs to पृषोदरादि class and is acutely accented on the last. सर्वरात्र is formed by the _samasanta_ affix अच् and is finally accented.\n\n(7) When the first member is a _Kritya_-formed word, as, भोज्यलवणम्, भोज्योष्णम्, पानीयशीतम्, हरणीयचूर्णम् (II. 1. 68). भोज्य is formed by ण्यत् and has _svarita_ on the final : पानीय and हरणीय are formed by अनीयर् and are accented on the penultimate (VI. 1. 185) and (VI. 1. 217) i. e. on ई ॥",

III. 4) and has acute on the final (III. 1. 3). लोहित is formed by the affix तन् added to रुह् (_Unadi_, III. 94) and has accent on the first (VI. 1. 197).\n\nWhy do we say 'color-denoting word'? Observe परमकृष्णः꣡ (VI. 1. 223). Why do we say 'with another color denoting word'? Observe कृष्णतिलाः꣡ (VI. 1. 223). Why do we say 'but not when it is एत'?

These are Genitive _Tatpurusha_ compounds. शम्ब is formed by adding वन् to शम् (_Unadi_. IV. 94), and has acute on the first (VI. 1. 197). अरित्र is formed by the affix इत्र added to ऋ (III. 2. 184), and has acute on the middle (III. 1. 3): गो is formed by डो (_Unadi_ II. 68) and has acute on the final ओ; अश्व is formed by क्वन् affix added to अश् (_Unadi_. I. 151), and has acute on the first (VI. 1. 197). The word प्रमाण here denotes 'quantity', 'measure', 'mass', 'limit', and not merely the length. The power of denoting measure by these words is here indicated by and is dependent upon accent.\n\nWhen not denoting प्रमाण we have परमगाध꣡म् and परमलवण꣡म् ॥",
    "62005": "Thus विद्या꣡दायादः, ध꣡नदायादः ॥ The word विद्या꣡ is formed by the affix क्यप् (III. 3. 99) which is _udatta_ (III. 3. 96). The word धन is derived by adding क्यु to धाञ् (_Unadi_. II. 81). Though the _Unadi_ _Sutra_ II. 81 ordains क्यु after the root धा preceded by नि, yet by बहुल (III. 3. 1) rule it comes after धा also when it is not preceded by नि and धन has acute on the first (III. 1. 3).\n\nIn the forms विद्यादायादः &c, what Genitive case has been taken? If it is the Genitive case which the word दायाद requires by Rule (II. 3. 39), then by the _Vartika_ प्रतिपदविधाना च षष्ठी न समस्यते (II. 2. 10 _Vartika_), there can be no compounding. The Genitive case there is the ordinary Genitive case of (II. 3. 50). i. e. a शैषिक Genitive case, and not a प्रतिपद Genitive. If it is a शेषलक्षण Genitive case, then why the other Genitive case is taught in (II. 3. 39) with regard to दायाद &c. That _sutra_ only indicates the existence of the Locative case in the alternative, and does not prevent the Genitive. In fact, had merely Locative been ordained in that _sutra_, this particular case would have prevented the Genitive on the maxim that a particular rule debars the general. But the employment of both terms Genitive and Locative in that _sutra_ indicates the alternative nature of the rule and shows that the Genitive case so taught is not a प्रतिपद Genitive, but a general Genitive. In short the Genitive taught in (II. 3. 39), is not an _apurva_-_vidhi_, the words naturally would have taken Genitive; the taking of the Locative is the only new thing taught there.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning inheritance'? Observe परमदायादः (VI. 1. 223) taking the final acute of a compound.",

This compound belongs either to the class of _Mayura_-_vyansakadi_ (II. 1. 72), or of an attribute and the thing qualified. When going to a place is delayed owing to some defective arrangement or cause, or becomes difficult, there is produced an obstacle or hinderance, and is called गमनचिरं or गमनकृच्छ्रं ॥ Why do we say 'which experiences a hinderance'?

Thus मूत्र꣡पदेन प्रस्थितः, उच्चार꣡पदेन प्रस्थितः ॥ Gone pretext of voiding urine or excreta.\n\nThe word मूत्र is derived by adding the affix ष्ट्रन् to the root मुच्, the ऊ being substituted for उच् of मुच्, (_Unadi_. IV. 163), and has acute on the first (VI. 1. 197) or it may be a word formed by घञ् to the root मूत्रयति ॥ The word उच्चार is also formed by घञ् and by (VI. 2. 144) has acute on the final.

So also दृष꣡त् शारदाः सक्तवः 'the _saktu_ flour fresh from the mill'. The word शारद means here 'fresh' 'new': and it forms an invariable compound. The word रज्जु is formed by उ affix added to सृज् (_Unadi_ I. 15), the स being elided. The affix उ is treated as नित् (_Unadi_ I. 9) and the accent falls on the first syllable (VI. 1. 197). The word दृष꣡त् is formed by the augment ष and shortening of the vowel of the root दृ 'to tear' (दृणाति), and the affix अदिक् (_Unadi_ 1. 131) and has accent on the final (III. 1. 3).\n\nWhy do we say 'when not meaning autumnal'?

The word कालाप comes from कलापिन् + अण्, (IV. 3. I08) in the sense of कलापिना प्रोक्तं (IV. 3. 101), and it would have preserved its form without change before this affix (VI. 4. 164) but for a _vartika_ which declares that the इन् of कलापिन् will be elided (See (VI. 1. 144) _vartika_). Thus कालाप gets accent on the final (III. 1. 3). So also सर्पिर्मण्ड꣡कषायम्, उमापुष्प꣡कषायम्, दौवारिक꣡कषायम् ॥ These are Genitive compounds. The words सर्पिमण्ड and उमापुष्प are Genitive compounds and have accent on the final (VI. 1. 223). The word दौवारिक is formed by ठक् affix added to द्वार and has acute on the final (VI. 1. 165). Why do we say when meaning a 'genus'? Observe, परमाध्व॒॒र्युः, परमकषा॒॒यः (VI. 1. 223).",

That case, however, is governed by (VI. 2. 2), which provides for Instrumental compounds.

The word गान्धारि belongs to the _Kardamadi_ class, and is consequently acute on the first or the second (_Phit_ III. 10) In the sense of पण्य we have: गोवाणिजः 'a dealer in cows', अश्ववाणिजः &c. गौ is finally accented (_Unadi_ II. 67): and अश्व has acute on the first (_Unadi_ I. 151) the affix being क्वन् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'the place whither one goes, or the goods in which one deals?'

The word भिक्षा is derived from भिक्ष, by the feminine affix अ (III. 3. 103), and has acute on the final (III. 1. 3). The word समुद्र has also acute on the final as it is a word denoting 'a sea', (_Phit_ _sutra_ I. 2). So also with उपज्ञा, as पाणिनो꣡पज्ञमकालकं व्याकरणम्; व्या꣡डुपपज्ञं दुष्करणम् आपिशल्युपज्ञ गुरुलाघव (see (II. 4. 21)). All these are Genitive compounds. The word पाणिन is derived by अण् affix from पणिन् (पणिनोऽपत्यम् = पाणिन꣡), and has acute on the final, (III. I. 3).

The word आढ्य (तत्रैत्यैनं ध्यायन्ति) is derived from आ + ध्यै + क affix added with the force of घञ्, the ध being changed to ढ the word belonging to पृषोदरादि class (VI. 3. 109), and it has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 144). The word दर्शनी꣡य is formed by अनीयर् and has acute on the penultimate नी owing to the indicatory र् (VI. 1. 217). The word सुकुमार has acute on the final by (VI. 2. 172). The word नन्द is formed by अच् (III. 1. 134). The _Tatpurusha_ compounds ending in उपज्ञा and उपक्रम are neuter by (II. 4. 21).

The word पार belongs to _Ghritadi_ class, and has acute on the final. तैतिलानां कद्रूः = तैतिल꣡कद्रूः, the son or pupil of _Titilin_ is _Taitila_ formed by अण् affix. पण्यकम्बलः, _panya_ ends in यत् and has acute on the first (VI. 1. 213).\n\nVart:- प꣡ण्यकम्बलः has acute on the first only when it is a name. Otherwise in पणितव्ये कम्बले compound, the accent will be on the final by the general rule (VI. I. 223). The word पण्य being formed by यत् affix (III. I. 101) is acutely accented on the first (VI. I. 213). The word पण्यकम्बलः is as Name when it means the market-blanket i. e. a blanket of a well known determinate size and fixed price, which is generally kept for sale by the blanket-sellers. But when the compound means a saleable blanket, it takes the _samasa_ accent (VI. 1. 223). If it be objected what is the use this _Vartika_, for the word पण्य being formed by a _kritya_ affix, will retain its accent in the _Tatpurusha_, by (VI. 2. 2), we reply that the कृत्य used in (VI. 2. 2) relates to _pratipadokta_ _kritya_ compounds such as ordained by कृत्यतुल्याख्या अजात्या (II. 1. 68), while here the compound is by विशेषणं विशेष्येण (II. 1. 51) and is a general compound. So also दास्याभारः = दासी꣡भारः ॥ The words belonging to _Dasi_ _bharadi_ class are all those _Tatpurusha_ compound words, not governed by any of the rules of accent, in which it is desired that the first member should retain its accent. Some of them are देव꣡जूतिः, देव꣡सूतिः, देववीतिः, व꣡सुनीतिः ॥ _Vasu_ has acute on the first being formed by a नित् affix _Unadi_ l. 9 10). ओषधिः = ओषोधीयतेऽस्याम्, formed by कि affix (III. 3. 93), ओष being formed by घञ् has acute on the first (VI. 1. 197). चन्द्र꣡माः is formed by असि affix added to the root माङ् माने preceded by the _upapada_ चन्द्र as, चन्द्र + मा + अस् = चन्द्रमस्, the affix being treated as डित् (_Unadi_ IV. 228), and चन्द्र is formed by रक affix (_Unadi_ II. 13) and has acute on the final.",
    "62043": "Thus यू꣡पदारु, कुण्डल꣡हिरण्यम् ॥ The word यूप् has accent on the first syllable, as it is formed by प (_Unadi_ III. 27) treated as a नित् (_Unadi_ III. 26). The word कुण्डल is formed by कल affix which is treated as चित् (_Unadi_ I. 108) and has acute on the final. So also र꣡थदारु, वल्लीहिरण्यम् ॥ _Ratha_ is first-acute formed by _kthan_ affix (_Unadi_ II. 2). _Valli_ has acute on the final formed by ङीष् affix. (IV. 1. 41) Why do we say 'it being suited to the first'? Observe कुबेरबलिः ॥ This accent applies when the second member denoting the material is modified into the first by workmanship. The composition takes place by (II. 1. 36).",
    "62044": "Thus मात्रे इदं = मात्र॑र्थम्, देव꣡तार्थम्, अ꣡तिथ्यर्थम् ॥ The words मातृ and पितृ are finally acute as taught so in _Unadi_ _sutra_ (_Unadi_ II. 95): देवता being formed by a लित् affix (V. 4. 27) has acute on the middle; अतिथि is formed by इथिन् affix and has acute on the first.\n\nThe difference between तदर्थ and अर्थ is that the former, like दारु 'wood', हिरण्य 'gold', has not inherent in it the sense of adaptibility, while अर्थ means 'adapted'. Some say that the making of two _sutras_, one with तदर्थ and the other with अर्थ indicates, that the former rule is applicable only to that compound where the material itself is changed into the substance of the first. Therefore the rule does not apply to अश्वघासः꣡, श्वश्रूसुरम् &c, though 'grass be suited for the horse' &c.",
    "62045": "Thus गो꣡हितम्, मनुष्य॑हितम्, अ꣡श्वहितम्, गो꣡रक्षितम्, अ꣡श्वरक्षितम्, तापस꣡रक्षितम् वनम् ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 36). The compound गोरक्षितं means गोभ्योदीयते and is a _sampradana_ Dative.",
    "62046": "This rule is confined to the Past Participles and the Nouns specifically mentioned in (II. 1. 59); on the maxim of _pratipadokta_ &c. Thus श्रेणिकृताः, पूग꣡कृताः, ऊक꣡कृताः, निध꣡नकृताः ॥ The word श्रे꣡णि has acute on the first as it is formed by the affix नि which is considered नित् (_Unadi_ IV. 51). The word पूग is end-acute as it is formed by the affix गक् (_Unadi_ I. 124). The word ऊक is also end-acute (VI. 2. 32). The word निध has acute on the middle. Why do we say in a _Karmadharaya_ compound? Observe श्रेण्या कृतं = श्रेनिकृत꣡म् ॥ Why do we say 'when it is a non-_nishtha_ word ?' Observe कृताकृतम् ॥ Here the compounding is by (II. 1. 60).",
    "62047": "Thus कष्ट꣡श्रितः, त्रिश꣡कलपतितः, ग्रा꣡मगतः ॥ _Kashta_ has acute on the end, _trisakala_ is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound (_trini_ _sakalani_ _asya_), and consequently acute on the first : _grama_ has acute on the first as it is formed by the नित् affix मन् added to ग्रस्, the final being replaced by आ (_Unadi_ I. 143) ॥ Why do we say 'when not meaning separation'? Observe कान्तारातीतः꣡, योजनातीतः,  because one has taken himself beyond _kantara_ and _yojana_.\n\nVart:- This rule does not apply when the Past Participle has an _upasarga_ attached; as सुखप्राप्तः꣡, दुःखप्राप्तः꣡, सुखापन्नः꣡, दुःखापन्नः꣡ (VI. 4. 144). This is an exception to rule (VI. 2. 144).",

Why do we say when having a Passive signification? Observe रथेन यातः = रथयातः, the '_kta_' is added to a verb of motion with an Active significance.",
    "62049": "Thus प्र꣡कृतः, प्र꣡हृतः ॥ Here one of the following rules would have applied otherwise, namely, either (1) the _Samasa_ end-acute (IV. 1. 223) (2) or the Indeclinable first member to retain its accent (VI. 2. 2), (3) or the end acute by (VI. 2. 139) and (VI. 2. 144). The present _sutra_ debars all these. Why do we say 'immediately?' Observe अभ्यु꣡द्धृतः, समु꣡द्धृतः, समुदा꣡हृतः ॥ Where the distant _Gati_ words अभि and सम् do not preserve their accent, but the immediately preceding _Gati_, as उत् does retain its accent, though it is not the first member of the compound word. Compare also (VIII. 2. 70). But in दूरात् + आ꣡गतः (_agata_ being governed by this rule) we have to दूरादागतः꣡, (II. 5. 39) and (VI. 3. 2) where (VI. 2. 144) has its scope, though it had not its scope in अभि + उ꣡द्धृतः = अभ्यु꣡द्धृतः ॥ In the former case this maxim applies कृद्ग्रहणे गतिकारकपूर्वस्यापि ग्रहणं ॥ \"A _Krit_ affix denotes whenever it is employed, a word-form which begins with that to which that _Krit_ affix has been added, and which ends with the _Krit_ affix, but moreover should a _Gati_ or a noun such as denotes a case-relation have been prefixed to that word-form, then the _Krit_ affix must denote the same word-form together with the _Gati_ or the noun which may have been prefixed to it\". In the second example, this maxim is not applied, because scope should be given to the word अनन्तर in this aphorism. When the Participle has not a Passive significance, the rule does not apply because the word कर्मणि is understood here also; as, प्रकृतः कटं देवदत्तः ॥ This _sutra_ debars (VI. 2. 144).",
    "62050": "Thus प्र꣡कर्ता (with तृन् ) प्र꣡कर्तुम् (with तुमुन्), प्र꣡कृतिः (with क्तिन्) ॥ This _sutra_ debars the _Krit_-affix accent (VI. 2. 139). Why do we say \"before an affix beginning with त्\"? Observe प्रज꣡ल्पाकः formed with the affix पाकन् (III. 2. 155), and the _Gati_ प्र, the accent being governed by (VI. 2. 139). Why do we say 'which is नित्'? Observe प्रकर्ता formed by तृच् affix. When a _Krit_-affix takes the augment इट्, it does not lose its character of beginning with त् on the _Vartika_ कृदुपदेशो वा ताद्यर्थमिडर्थम् ॥ Thus प्र꣡लपिता, प्र꣡लपितुम् ॥ Why do we say \"but not before तु\"?

( _Phit_ _Sutra_ IV. 13) which declares उपसर्गा आद्युदात्ता अभिवर्जम् ॥ This debars कृत् accent (VI. 2. 139) and is an exception to the rule that in a single word, a single syllable only has acute.",
    "62052": "Thus प्रा꣡ङ्, प्रा꣡ञ्चौ, प्रा꣡ञ्चः or प्रा॑ङ्, प्रा॑ञ्चौ, प्रा॑ञ्चः ॥   The accent is acute and optionally _svarita_ by (VIII. 2. 6). So also प꣡राङ्, प꣡राञ्चौ, प꣡राञ्चः , प꣡राचः, प꣡राचा ॥ But with प्रति which ends in इ, we have प्रत्यङ्, प्रत्यञ्चौ, प्रत्यञ्चः here by (VI. 2. 139) the second member retains its original accent. Why do we say 'before an affix व्'? Observe उदञ्चनः ॥ When the nasal of '_anch_' is elided, then rule (VI. 1. 222) presents itself; but that rule is superseded when a _Gati_ not ending in इ or उ precedes, because the present rule is subsequent. Thus प꣡राचः and प꣡राचाः ॥ In some texts, the reading is अञ्चतावप्रत्यये ॥ The affix व् is like क्विप् &c, (VI. 1.67).",
    "62053": "Thus न्य॑ङ्, न्य॑ञ्चौ, न्य॑ञ्चः ॥ The अ becomes _svarita_ by (VIII. 2. 4). So also अ꣡ध्यङ्, अ꣡ध्यञ्चौ, अ꣡ध्यञ्चः, अ꣡धीचः, अ꣡धीचः, नी꣡चः, नी꣡चा ॥",

But in ईषद्भेदः &c, the _Krit_-accent will necessarily take place (VI. 2. 139); no option being allowed; because the compounds to which the present rule applies are, on the maxim of _pratipadokta_, those formed by ईषत् with non-_Krit_ words under (II. 2. 7).",

Observe प्रस्थधनम् ॥ Why do we say 'quantity'? Observe कांचनधनम् ॥ Why do we say 'धन'? Observe निष्कमाला ॥",
    "62056": "Thus प्रथमवैयाकरणः or प्रथमवैयाकरणः = संप्रतिव्याकरणमध्येतुं प्रवृत्तः 'one who has recently commenced to study Grammar'. The word प्रथम is derived from प्रथ by अमच् (_Unadi_ V. 68) and by चित् accent the acute falls on the last. Why do we say when meaning 'a Novice?' Observe प्रथमवैयाकरणः (वैयाकरणानामाद्यो मुख्यो वा यः सः) 'the first Grammarian or a Grammarian of the first rank'. It will always have acute on the final.",
    "62057": "Thus कतर꣡कठः or कतरकठः꣡, कतम꣡कठः or कतमकठः꣡ ॥ The word _Karmadharaya_ is used for the sake of the next _sutra_, this _sutra_ could have done without it, as '_katara_' and '_katama_' by the maxim of _pratipadokta_, form only _Karmadharaya_ compound by (II. I. 63).",
    "62058": "Thus आर्य॑ब्राह्मणः or आर्यबाह्मणः꣡, आर्य॑कुमारः or आर्यकुमारः꣡ ॥ The word आर्य is formed by ण्यत् affix and has _svarita_ on the final. Why do we say '_Arya_'? Observe परमब्राह्मणः꣡, परमकुमारः꣡ ॥ Why do we say before '_Brahmana_' and '_Kumara_'? Observe आर्यक्षत्रियः ॥ Why '_Karmadharaya_ ?' Observe आर्यस्य ब्राह्मणः = आर्यब्राह्मणः꣡ ॥ According to the Accentuated Text the accent is आ꣡र्य (Pro. Bohtlingk).",
    "62059": "Thus रा꣡जब्राह्मणः or राजब्राह्मणा꣡, रा꣡जकुमारः or राजकुमारः꣡ ॥ The word राजन् is formed by the affix कनिन् added to राज् (_Unadi_ I. 156). But राज्ञो ब्राह्मण = राजब्राह्मणः where the compound is not _Karmadharaya_. The making of this a separate aphorism is for the purpose of preventing the _yathasankhya_ rule and also for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_ into which the _anuvritti_ of राजन् runs and not of आर्य ॥",
    "62060": "The words राजन् and अन्यतरस्याम् are understood here also. Thus रा꣡ज्ञः प्रत्येनाः or राज्ञः प्रत्येना꣡ ॥ The sign of the Genitive is not elided by (VI. 3. 21). When आक्रोश is not meant we have, रा꣡जप्रत्येनाः or राजप्रत्येनाः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'ending in the Genitive'? Observe राजा चासौ प्रत्येनाश्च = राजप्रत्येनाः no option.",
    "62061": "Thus नि꣡त्यप्रहसितः or नित्यप्रहसितः꣡, सतत꣡प्रहसितः or सततप्रहसितः꣡ ॥ These are Accusative compounds formed under Rule (II.

The word सतत being formed by क्त affix with the force of भावः, has acute on final by (VI. 2. 14). If it be considered to have been formed by कर्मणि क्त, then the accent will be on the beginning by (VI. 2. 49). Why do we say when the first term means 'always'? Observe मुहूर्त्तप्रहसितः꣡ ॥ In the case of नित्यप्रहसितः &c the _samasa_ accent (VI. 1. 223) was first set aside by the Accusative _Tatpurusha_ accent (VI. 2. 2). this in its turn was set aside by क्त accent (VI. 2. 144), which is again debarred by the present.",

Why do we say 'a professional man'? Observe राजहस्ती 'a royal elephant'.",
    "62064": "This is an _adhikara_ aphorism. The first syllable of the पूर्वपद will get the acute in the following aphorisms. In short, the phrase '_adir_ _udatta_' should be supplied to complete the sense of the subsequent _sutras_. The very next _sutra_ illustrates it. That _sutra_ literally means \"a word in the Locative case or a word denoting the name of the receiver of a tax or tribute, standing before a word denoting that which is lawful, but not before हरण\". To complete the sense we must supply the words \"has acute on the first syllable\". Thus स्तूपेशाणः, मुकुटे कार्षापणम्, याज्ञिकाश्वः, वैयाकरणहस्ती ॥ The word आदि 'the first syllable' is understood upto (VI. 2. 91), the word उदात्त has longer stretch: it governs upto (VI. 2. 137).",
    "62065": "The word हारिण् means 'appropriates the dues or taxes': and धर्म्यम् means 'the due or tax which has been determined by the custom or usage, of the country, town, sect or family, that which one is lawfully entitled to get'. The word धर्म्य is formed by यत् under (IV. 4. 91) and (IV. 4. 92) and has the sense of both. Of Locative words we have the following examples : - स्तु꣡पे-शाणः मु꣡कुटे- कार्षापणम्, ह꣡ले-द्विपदिका, ह꣡ले-त्रिपदिका, दृ꣡षदि-माषकः ॥ These compounds are formed under (II. 1. 44), and the sign of the Locative is not elided by (VI. 3. 9) and (VI. 3. 10). With the name of a due-receiver हारी we have the following :- या꣡ज्ञिकाश्वः 'the horse which is the customary due of the sacrificer'. So also वै꣡याकरणहस्ती, मा꣡तुलाश्वः, पि꣡तृव्यगवः ॥ In some places the established usage is to give a शाण coin in every sacred Tope &c, or to give a horse to a sacrificer &c. Why do we say 'what is lawful'? Observe स्तम्बेरमः꣡, कर्मकर वर्द्धितकः꣡ वर्द्धितको नाम मूले स्थूलोग्रे सूक्ष्म ओदन पिण्डः, स कर्मकराय दीयते, अन्यथा कर्म न कुर्यादिति, न त्वयं धर्मः ॥ Why do we say \"but not before हरण\"? Observe वाडवहरण꣡म् ' that which is given to a mare'. हरण is that customary food which is given to a mare after she has been covored, in order to strengthen her. The word हरण is a _Krit_-formed word, its exclusion here indicates that other _Krit_-formed words however are governed by this rule when preceded by a हारी denoting word; and thus this _sutra_ supersedes the _Krit_ accent enjoined by (VI. 2. 139), so far. Thus वाडवहार्यः has acute on the first by this rule, the subsequent (VI. 2. 139) not applying.",

    "62080": "The word उपमान means the object with which something is likened : means शब्दार्थ 'expressing a sound'; प्रकृति means 'root, without any preposition'. Thus उ꣡ष्ट्रक्रोशिन्, ध्वा꣡ङ्क्षराविन्, ख꣡रनादिन् ॥ The word उपमान shows the scope of this _sutra_ as distinguished from the last. So that, when the first term is an उपमान word, the preceding _sutra_ will not apply, though the second member may be a णिनि formed word. When the second term is not a word denoting sound, the rule will not apply. As वृकवञ्चि꣡न्, वृकप्रेक्षि꣡न् which retain _krit_ accent (VI. 2. 139) Why do we say 'a radical word without any preposition'? Observe गर्दभोच्चारिन्, कोकिलभिष्याहारिन् ॥ Here the second terms radically (i.e. _charin_ and _harin_) do not denote sounds, but it is with the help of the Prepositions उत् and अभि, वि and आ that they mean sound. The force of एव is that the उपमान words are restricted. Such words get acute on the first syllable only then, when the second member is a radical sound name. According to _Patanjali_, the first syllable gets acute, whether it denotes उपमान or not, when the second word is a radical denoting sound. (शब्दार्थ प्रकृतौ ह्युपमानं चानुपमानं चाद्युदात्तमिष्यते) ॥ As पुष्कलजल्पिन्, for had एव not been used, the _sutra_ would have run thus: उपमानं शब्दार्थप्रकृतौ and would mean:--\"If the second member is a sound denoting radical word, then the _upamana_ first member and no other will get the acute\". But this is not what is intended : because when the second member is a sound-denoting radical, the first member will get the acute, whether it is _upamana_ word or not. The word एव therefore restricts _upamana_; i.e. a first member denoting उपमानं will get the accent then only, when the second term is a sound-denoting radical. If the second term is not a sound denoting radical, the first term denoting _upamana_ will not get the accent. The compounding takes place by (III. 2. 79).",

Some say, these declare a restrictive rule with regard to the first and second member of these terms. Thus रोहिन् &c must be preceded by युक्त, &c and युक्त &c followed by रोहिन् &c to make this rule (VI. 2. 79) applicable. Thus वृक्षारोहिन् though ending in णिनि does not take acute on the first, so युक्ताध्यायिन् ॥ 8 आगतमत्स्या or त्स्य, 9 क्षीरहोता, 10 भगिनीभर्त्ता ॥ The last two are Genitive compounds under Rule (II. 2.9). 11 ग्रामगोधुक्, 12 अश्वत्रिरात्रः, 13 गर्गत्रिरात्रः, 14 व्युष्टत्रिरात्रः, 15 शनपादः (गणपादः), 16 समपादः ॥ All these are Genitive compounds. 17 एकशितिपात् = एकःशितिः पादोऽस्य ॥ This is a _Bahuvrihi_ of three terms. The word एकशितिः is a _Taddhitartha_ _Samasa_ (II. I. 51), and being a _Tatpurusha_, required acute on the final, as the _Tatpurusha_ accent is stronger. This declares acute on the first. Moreover by (VI. 2. 29), this word एकशितिः would have acute on the first, as it is a _Dvigu_ ending in a simple vowel. But the very fact that this word is enumerated here, shows that other _Dvigu_ compounds in शिति are not governed by (VI. 2. 29), therefore द्विशितिपाद् has acute on ति ॥ The enumeration of the एकशितिपात् further proves by implication that the (एकशितिपात् स्वरवचनं ज्ञापक निमित्तस्वरबलीयस्त्वस्य) accent for the application of which a case is present is stronger. (See _Mahabhashya_ II. I. I.) The class of compounds known as पात्रेसमित &c, (II. I. 48) also belong to this class.\n\n1 युक्तारोही, 2 आगतरोही, 3 आगतयोधी, 4 आगतवञ्ची, 5 आगतनन्दी (आगतनर्दी), 6 आगतप्रहारी, 7 आगतमत्स्यः (आगतमत्स्या), 8 क्षीरहोता, 9 भगिनीभर्ता, 10 ग्रामगोधुक्, 11 अश्वत्रिरात्रः 12 गर्गत्रिरात्रः, 13 व्युष्टित्रिरात्रः, 14 गणपादः (शणपादः), 15 एकशितिपात्, 16 पात्रेसंमितादयश्च (पात्रेसमितादयश्च), 17 समपादः ॥",

Why do we say with the exception of लोमन and उषत्? Observe सुलोम꣡न and सूष꣡स् (VI. 2. 172). The following maxim applies here: अनिमस्मन् ग्रहणान्यर्थवता चानर्थकेन च तदन्तविधिं प्रयोजयन्ति \"whenever अम्, or इन् or अस् or मन्, when they are employed in Grammar, denote by (I. I. 72), something that ends with अन् or इन् or अस् or मन्, there (अन्, इन्, अस् and मन्) represent these combinations of letters, both in so far as they possess and also in so far as they are void of, a meaning\". Therefore the मन् and अस् void of meaning are also included here. Thus धर्मन् is formed by मन् (_Unadi_ I. 140), but कर्मन् is formed by मनिन् (_Unadi_. IV. 145), and प्रथिमन् is formed by इमनिच् affix (V. I. 122) in which मन् is only a part. Similarly यशस् is formed by असुन् (_Unadi_ IV. 191), and so also स्रोतस् (_Unadi_ IV. 202); but in सुध्व꣡स् (सुध्वम् from ध्वंस् with the affix क्विप् (III. 2. 76)) the rule applies also, though अस् is here part of the root. But when the _samasanta_ affix कप् is added (V. 4. 154), then the accent falls on the syllable immediately preceding कप्, for there the subsequent Rule (VI. 2. 173) supersedes the present rule: thus सुकर्म꣡कः, सुस्रोत꣡स्कः ॥",

The word कृत् is employed in the _sutra_ for the sake of distinctness; for a _gati_, _karaka_ or _upapada_ could not be followed by any other word than a _krit_-formed word, if there is to be a _samasa_. For two sorts of affixes come after a root (_dhatu_) namely तिङ् and कृत् ॥ A _samasa_ can take place with _krit_-formed. words, but not with _tinanta_ words. So that without employing कृत् in the _sutra_, we could have inferred that कृत् was meant. Therefore, it is said the '_Krit_' is employed in the _sutra_ for the sake of distinctness. According to this view we explain the accent in प्रपचतितराम्, प्रपचतितमाम्, by saying that first compounding takes place with  प्र and the words पचतितर and पचतितम ending in तरप् and तमप् and then आम्, is added and the accent of the whole word is regulated by आम् by the rule of सतिशिष्ट (see (V. 3. 56) and (V. 4. 11). According to others, the कृत् is taken in this _sutra_, in order to prevent the _gati_ accent applying to verbal compounds in words like प्र꣡पचति देश्यः, or प्र꣡पचति देशीयं (V. 3. 67), or प्र꣡पचतिरूपम् (V. 3. 66).

So that the restriction should apply to '_karaka_', and not to '_Datta_' and '_Sruta_'. For the words '_Datta_' and '_Sruta_' will have acute on the final even after a non_karaka_ word. As संश्रूतः꣡, विश्रूतः꣡ ॥ Why do we say 'when denoting benediction'? The rule will not apply where benediction is not meant. As देवैः खाता = देवखाता ॥ This rule applies to _Datta_ and _Sruta_ after a _karaka_-word, only when benediction is meant. It therefore does not apply to देवद꣡त्त 'the name of _Arjuna_'s conch', as आहतोनदति देवद꣡त्तः, which is governed by (VI. 2. 48).",

For the _Sutra_ (III. 3. 116) may be explained by saying that (1) ल्युट् is applied when the _Upapada_ is in the objective case and _bhava_ is meant, (2) as well as when object is to be expressed. When the first explanation is taken, the above are examples of _Bhava_; when the second explanation is taken, they are examples pf _Karma_. Why do we say \"ending in अन्\"?

For had the present _sutra_ meant that the final of the second member (उत्तरपद) preceded by नञ् and सु gets the acute, then there would have been no necessity of the next _sutra_, for the present would have covered the case of सुकुमारीक &c because कप् is not a part of the second term (_uttarapada_) कुमारी but of the compound (_Samasa_) सुकुमारी; and therefore, if we translated the present _sutra_, by saying that the end of second term gets acute, the accent would have fallen on ई in सुकुमारीकः even by this _sutra_.

By (VI. 2. 177), even मुख would have oxytone after an _upasarga_, the present _sutra_ makes the additional declaration that मुख is oxytone even when the compound is not a _Bahuvrihi_, when it does not denote an indispensable part of body, or a part of body even, as was the case in (VI. 2. 177). Thus अभिमुखा꣡ शाला ॥",
    "62186": "Thus अपमुख꣡म्, अपमुखः꣡ ॥ The compound is in one case _Avyayibhava_ also, when rule (VI. 2. 33) will be superseded. The separation of this from the last _sutra_, is for the sake of the subsequent aphorism, in which the _anuvritti_ of अप only goes.",

This further shows that the _samasanta_ affixes are not compulsory. (अनित्यश्च समासान्तः), अपकुक्षिः, अपसीरः꣡ अपहलः꣡, अपलाङ्गल꣡म्, अपनाम꣡ ॥ These are प्रादि compounds or _Bahuvrihi_ or _Avyayibhavas_. Some of these viz. स्फिग, पूत and कुक्षिः will be end-acute by (VI. 2. 177), also when they denote parts of body and a permanent condition and the compound is a _Bahuvrihi_.

This also indicates that the _samasanta_ rule is not universal. When the _samasanta_ affix is added, then also the acute is on the final, for the कार्यी is here the _Bahuvrihi_ compound, and this is only a part of it. Thus द्विमूर्द्धः, त्रिमूर्द्धः ॥ Why after द्वि and त्रि ? Observe कल्या꣡णमूर्धा here the first member is middle acute by _Phit_ II. 19 and this accent is retained (VI. 2. I). Why 'पाद् &c'?

Thus _sutra_ (VI. 3. 2) says \"the affixes of the Ablative after '_stoka_' &c\". The present _sutra_ should be read there to complete the sense, e. g. \"the affixes of the Ablative after _stoka_ &c are not elided before the second member of the compound\".

Therefore, in forming the compound of स्तोकात् मुक्तः, the ablative ending required to be dropped. The present _sutra_ prevents that. The words स्तोक &c in the dual and plural are never compounded, and consequently this rule does not apply to them. Thus स्तोकाभ्यां मुक्तः, स्तोकेभ्यः मुक्तः are separate words and not compounds, for not being treated as compounds, these are not one _Pada_ (एकपद) or one word, and do not have one accent, for in one word, there is only one acute. Thus while स्तोकान्मुक्तः꣡ being one compound word will have one acute (VI. I. 158), (VI. 2. 144), the word स्तोकाभ्यां मुक्तः being treated as two words, will have separate acute accents. The above compounding takes place by (II. I. 39).\n\nVart:- The word ब्राह्मणाच्छंसिन् should be enumerated in this connection. Here also the Ablative is not elided.

    "63030": "Thus दिवस्पृथिव्यौ, द्यावापृथिव्यौ ॥ The word दिवस् is exhibited in the aphorism as दिवस् ending in अ, in order to indicate that the स् of दिवस् is not changed to ह् or a _visarga_ or _upadhmaniya_ when followed by पृथिवी ॥ Following is an anomalous use there being no _Dvandva_ compounding here. द्यावा चिदस्मै पृथिवी ममेते ॥",
    "63031": "Thus:- उषासासूर्यम्, उषासानक्ता ॥",
    "63032": "This is formed by अरङ् substitution of the ऋ of मातृ ॥ The other form is मातापितरौ ॥",
    "63033": "In the ordinary language मातापितरौ is the proper form. The Vedic form is derived by adding अङ् to the first member, and आ is added to the second by (VII. 1. 39) : and then _Guna_ by (VII. 3. 110). Thus आ मा गन्तां पितरामातरा च ॥",
    "63034": "The words of this _sutra_ require a detailed analysis; स्त्रियाः 'for a feminine word', पुंवद् \"like the masculine\", i.e. a substitute like the masculine takes the room of a feminine word. भाषितपुंस्कात् = भाषितपुमान्येन, by which a masculine is spoken of i.e. a word which has an equivalent masculine, the correspondence must be in the form (आकृति) and the connotation (आयाम) of the two words; that is when both the words are coextensive in their denotation, applying to the same objects, but of different genders. A word which has not the affix ऊङ् is called अनूङ् ॥ That feminine word which does not end in ऊङ् and has a corresponding masculine word, having the same form and connotation, (of course, with the exception of affixes) is called a भाषितपुंस्कादनूङ् स्त्रीशब्दः ॥ The word भाषितपुंस्कादनूङ् is a _Bahuvrihi_, the fifth affix is not elided anomalously. Of such a भाषितपुंस्कादनूङ् feminine word, there is the substitution of a masculine form. Provided that, the second member is a (समानाधिकरण) i.e. a word in apposition with the first, and (स्त्रियाम्) of the feminine gender : with the exception of an Ordinal numeral (पूरण) and of प्रिय &c.\n\nThus दर्शनीयभार्यः (= दर्शनीयाभार्या यस्य). Here दर्शनीया is a feminine word having a corresponding masculine word of the same form and force, namely, दर्शनीयः, moreover this feminine does not end in the affix ऊङ्, but in the affix आ; it is followed by another feminine word भार्या which is in the same case with it, and which is not a Numeral nor included in the प्रियादि class; hence this word दर्शनीया is changed to the corresponding masculine word दर्शनीय ॥ So also श्लक्ष्णचूडः, दीर्घजङ्घः ॥ Why do we say स्त्रियाः 'for a feminine word'? Observe ग्रामणि ब्राह्मणकुलं दृष्टिरस्य = ग्रामणिदृष्टिः ॥ Why do we say which has an appropriate masculine (भाषितपुंस्कः)? Observe खट्वाभार्यः ॥ There is no corresponding masculine of खट्वा ॥ Why do we say \"of the same connotation and form समानायामाकृतौ\"? Observe द्रोणीभार्यः, the masculine word द्रोण has not the same significance as द्रोणी ॥ The words गर्भिभार्यः, प्रसूतभार्यः, and प्रजातभार्यः are anomalous. Why do we say not ending in ऊङ्? Observe ब्रह्मबन्धूभार्यः ॥ Why do we say 'both words being in the same case and referring to another person'? Observe कल्याण्यामाता = कल्याणीमाता \"the mother of _Kalyani_\". Why do we say स्त्रियाम् 'followed by a feminine word'? Observe कल्याणी प्रधानमेषां = कल्याणीप्रधानाः (इमे) ॥ Here the second member प्रधान is a Neuter word. Why do we say 'not being an ordinal Numeral'? Observe कल्याणी पञ्चमी यासां ताः = कल्याणी पञ्चमारात्रयः, so also कल्याणीदशमाः ॥ The Ordinal Numbers must be the Principal Ordinal and not the secondary Derivative Ordinals. Therefore the rule applies here कल्याणपञ्चमीकः पक्षः ॥ The _samasanta_ affix अप् (V. 4. 116) also applies to an Ordinal which is a Principal and not what is used as a secondary word : and therefore the above compound does not take अप् ॥ Why do we say not before प्रिय &c. Observe कल्याणीप्रियः ॥\n\n1 प्रिया, 2 मनोज्ञा, 3 कल्याणी, 4 सुभगा, 5 दुर्भगा, 6 भक्ति, 7 सचिवा, 8 स्वा (स्वसा), 9 कान्ता, 10 क्षान्ता, 11 समा, 12 चपला, 13 दुहिता, 14 वामना (वामा)15 तनया, 16 अम्बा ॥ The compound is दृढभक्तिः is anomalous.",
    "63035": "Thus तस्याः शालायाः = ततः, तस्यां = तत्र, यस्यां  = यत्र, यस्या = यतः ॥ The following are the affixes before which the feminine is changed to masculine: त्र and तस्, तरप् and तमप्, चरट्, जातीयर्, कल्पप्, देश्य, देशीयर् रूपप्, पाशप्, थम, थाल, दा and र्हिल तिल् तातिल् ॥ All other affixes do not affect the gender. Thus तरप् तमप् &c दर्शनीयतरा, दर्शनीयतमा, पटुचरी, पटुजातीया, दर्शनीयकल्पा, दर्शनीयदेशीया, दर्शनीयरूपा, दर्शनीयपाशा ॥ कया प्रकृत्या = कथम्, यया प्रकृत्या = यथा, तस्यां वेलाया = तदा, तर्हि &c.\n\nVart:- The feminine of बहु and अल्प is changed to masculine before the _Taddhita_ affix शस्ः- as बह्वीभ्यो देहि = बहुशो देहि; अल्पाभ्यो देहि = अल्पशो देहि ॥\n\nVart:- A feminine Adjective is changed into masculine before the affixes त्व and तल् ॥ As पट्व्या भावः = पटुत्वम् or पटुता ॥ Why do we say 'an adjective'? Observe कठ्या भावः = कण्ठीत्वं or कठीता ॥\n\nVart:- The feminine word is changed to masculine before all _Taddhita_ affixes, except ड, when the word gets the designation of भ ॥ Thus हस्तिनीनां समूहः =हास्तिकम् ॥ Had the word not become masculine, then हस्तिनी having lost its ई (VI. 4. 148), the word न् of हस्तिन् the would not be elided before the _Taddhita_ affix, because the _lopa_-elision being _sthanivat_, would have prevented the application of the rule (VI. 4. 144), ordaining the elision of the final syllable. So the form would have been something like हास्तिनिकम् instead of हास्तिकम् ॥ Why do we say 'with the exception of ड'? Observe श्यैनेयः, रौहिनेयः the masculine being श्येत and रोहित ॥ The word आग्नेयः (= अग्नायी देवता अस्य स्थालीपाकस्य) is an exception to this rule.\n\nVart:- The masculine-change takes place before the affixes ठक् and छस् ॥ As भवत्या श्छात्रा = भावस्काः, भवदीयाः ॥",
    "63036": "Thus from एनी = एतायते, श्येनी = श्येतायते ॥ मानिन् :- दर्शनीयमानी अयमस्याः \"He esteems her as handsome\". दर्शनीयमानिनीयमस्याः (इयम् अस्याः \"She esteems her as handsome\". The word मानिन् is employed for the sake of non-feminine and non-appositional words. Thus non-feminine words :- दर्शनीयां मन्यते देवदत्तो यज्ञदत्तां = दर्शनीयमानी अयमस्याः ॥ For non-appositional words :- as, दर्शनीयां मन्यते देवदत्तां यज्ञदत्ता = दर्शनीयमानिनी इयमस्याः ॥",

This rule is an exception to all the previous rules (VI. 3. 34) – (VI. 3. 36) : and not only to (VI. 3. 34).\n\nVart :- The rule applies to the क of the affix वु and the _Taddhita_ क and not to every क ॥ Therefore the masculine transformation takes place here पाकभार्यः, भेकभार्यः ॥ The word पाका means \"young\"; and भेकी means 'action'.",
    "63038": "Thus दत्ताभार्यः । गुप्ताभार्यः । दत्तापाशा । गुप्तापाशा । दत्तायते । गुप्तायते । दत्तामानिनी । गुप्तामानिनी । पूरण्याः । पञ्चमीभार्यः । दशमीभार्यः । पञ्चमीपाशा । दशमीपाशा । पञ्चमीयते । दशमीयते । पञ्चमीमानिनी । दशमीमानिनी ॥",

Observe मध्यमभार्यः (मध्ये भवा = मध्यमा formed by the affix म (IV. 3. 8) which does not cause _Vriddhi_). Why do we say 'of a _Taddhita_'? Observe काण्डलावभार्यः (काण्डं लुनाति = काण्डलावी with अण् (कर्मण्यण्) and ङीप्). Why do we say when not meaning 'colored there with' or 'made thereof'? Observe कषायेण रक्ता = काषायी, काषायी वृहतिका यस्य = काषायवृहतिकः, लोहस्य विकारोलौही लौही ईषा यस्य स्थस्य = लोहेषः (IV. 3. 134). The word वृद्धिनिमित्तस्य should be explained as a _Bahuvrihi_, and not a _Tatpurusha_, i. e. a _taddhita_ affix, in which there is an element like ण् or ञ् or क् &c which causes _Vriddhi_. Therefore this exception does not apply to तावद्भार्यः यावद्भार्यः (तावती भार्या यस्य &c). Here the affix वतुप् (V. 2. 39) added to तद् does not cause _Vriddhi_ by its own force, but by (VI. 3. 91).",
    "63040": "Thus दीर्घकेशीभार्यः, शुक्लकेशीभार्यः, दीर्घकेशीपाशा, श्लक्ष्णकेशीपाशा, दीर्घकेशीयते, श्लक्ष्णकेशीयते, but पटुभार्यः (पटु not denoting any bodily member), अकेशभार्यः (अकेशा भार्या, not ending in long ई), and दीर्घकेशमानिनी ॥ The exception अमानिनि has been added from the _Vartika_ and is no part of the original _sutra_.",
    "63041": "Thus कठीभार्यः, बह्वृचीभार्यः कठीपाशा, बह्वृचीपाशा, कठीयते, बह्वृचीयते ॥ But not so when मानिन् follows, as कठमानिनी, बह्वृचमानिनी ॥\n\nThe exception does not apply to हस्तिनीनां समूहः = हास्तिकम् ॥",
    "63042": "This _sutra_ is enunciated as a prohibition to the preceding _sutras_. Thus it applies even to words having a penultimate क (VI. 3. 37). Thus पाचकवृन्दारिका, पाचकजातीया, पाचकदेशीया ॥ It applies even to Names and the feminines which are ordinals in opposition to (VI. 3. 38). Thus दत्तवृन्दारिका, दत्तजातीया, दत्तदेशीया, पंचमवृन्दारिका, पंचमजातीया, पंचमदेशीया ॥ It applies even in opposition to (VI. 3. 39): स्रौघ्नवृन्दारिका, स्रौघ्नजातीया, स्रौघ्नदेशीया ॥ So also in opposition to (VI. 3. 40), as श्लक्ष्णमुखवृन्दारिका, श्लक्ष्णमुखजातीया and श्लक्ष्णमुखदेशीया ॥ So also in opposition to (VI. 3. 41), as कठवृन्दारिका, कठजातीया, कठदेशीया ॥\n\nThe feminine must have a corresponding masculine (भाषितपुंस्क), So the rule does not apply खट्वावृन्दारिका, as खट्वा has no corresponding masculine. The feminine should not end in ऊ; as ब्रह्मबन्धूवृन्दारिका ॥\n\nVart:- The words कुक्कुटी &c becomes masculine before अण्ड &c : as, कुक्कुट्या अण्डं = कुक्कुटाण्डन् । भृग्याः पदं = भृगपदम्, मृग्याः क्षीरं = मृगक्षीरम्, काक्याः शावः = काकशावः ॥ This rule need not be made, as the first member in these compounds may be considered as class denoting words of common gender.\n\nVart:- When a word formed by an affix having an indicatory ख, or the affixes तर and तम &c (VI. 3. 43) follow, the final long vowel of the first term becomes short instead of its becoming masculine. As कालीमात्मानं मन्यते काल्येवाहम् = कालिंमन्या (compare (VI. 3.66)) हरिणिंमन्या, पट्वितरा, पट्वितमा, पट्विरूपा, पट्विकल्पा, पट्विका, मृद्विका ॥ We have said that the rule does not apply to the feminines in ऊ ॥ The words इडविट्, दरद्, पृथ and उशिज are names of countries denoting _Kshatriya_ clans. The _tadraja_ affix (VI. 1. 168) and (VI. 1. 170), is elided in forming the feminine of these (IV. 1. 177). Thus we have the compound of इडविट् वृन्दारिका ॥ When the first words become masculine, we have ऐडविड, दारद्, &c. Thus ऐडविडवृन्दारिका, औशिजवृन्दारिका ॥",

Why do we say ending in ई (ङी)? Observe दत्तातरा, गुप्तातरा ॥ Why do we say consisting of more than one syllable ? Because words of one syllable optionally become shortened by the next rule. Why do we say having a corresponding masculine? Observe आमलकीतरा कुवलीतरा, where आमलकी and कुवली have no equivalent masculine forms.",
    "63044": "What are the शेष or the remnants? Those feminines which are not formed by long ई (ङी), and are called _Nadi_; and those feminines which end in long ई but consist of one syllable.

I58, 160)",
    "63045": "Thus श्रेयसितरा or श्रेयसीतरा, or श्रेयस्तरा, विदुषितरा or विदुषीतरा or विद्वत्तरा ॥ The first is formed by the _Taddhita_ affix ईयसुन्, and the second by क्वसु ॥ In one alternative, there is masculisation also when we get the forms श्रेयस्तरा &c.

    "63046": "As महादेवः, महाब्राह्मणः, महाबाहुः, महाबलः, महाजातीयः ॥ But महतः पुत्रः = महत्पुत्रः \"the son of the great man\": the two words are not in apposition. The compounding with महत् takes place under (II. 1. 61). This rule applies to compounds under that rule, as well as to _Bahuvrihis_, when also the two words are in apposition, as in महाबाहुः ॥ In fact this is the object of using the word _samanadhikarana_ in this _sutra_. Had it not been used, then by the maxim of _pratipadokta_, the rule would have applied only to the _Tatpurusha_ compounds of _mahat_ taught under (II. I. 61) but not to _Bahuvrihis_. In महद्भूतश्चन्द्रमा = अमहान् महान् संपन्नः, the long आ is not substituted, as the sense of महत् is here secondary.\n\nVart:- आ is substituted for the final of महत् before घास, कर and विशिष्ट, the feminine महती being changed to masculine, though the words may not be in apposition. As महत्या घासः = महाघासः, महत्याः करः = महाकरः, महत्याविशिष्टः = महाविशिष्टः ॥\n\nVart:- आ is substituted for the final of अष्टन् before कपाल, when a sacrificial offering is meant. As अष्टाकपालं चरुं निर्वपेत ॥ Why do we say when meaning a sacrificial offering? Observe अष्टकपालं ब्राह्मणस्य ॥\n\nVart:- आ is substituted for the final of अष्टन् before गौ, when the meaning is that of 'yoked'. As, अष्टागवेन शकटेन ॥ But अष्टगवं ब्राह्मणस्य, where 'yoking' is not meant. The त् in आत् is for the sake of distinctness.",
    "63047": "Thus द्वादश, द्वाविंशतिः, द्वात्रिंशत्, अष्टादश, अष्टाविंशतिः, अष्टात्रिंशत् ॥ Why do we say द्वि and अष्टन् ॥ Observe पञ्चदश ॥ Why do we say 'when followed by a Numeral'? Observed द्वै मातुरः, अष्टमातुरः ॥ Why do we say 'not when the compound is a _Bahuvrihi_, or the word अशीति follows'? Observe द्वित्राः, त्रिदशाः, द्व्यशीतिः ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies upto one hundred. Therefore not here, द्विशतम्, द्विसहस्रम्, अष्टशतम्, अष्टसहस्रम् ॥",
    "63048": "As, त्रयोदश, त्रयोविंशतिः, त्रयस्त्रिंशत् ॥ But not in त्रैमातुरः (the second word not being a Numeral), nor in त्रिदशाः which is a _Bahuvrihi_, (II. 2. 25) त्र्यशीति ॥ This substitution takes place upto hundred : not here, त्रिशतम्, त्रिसहस्रम् ॥",

    "63051": "Thus हृच्छोकः or हृदयशोकः, सौहार्द्यम् or सौहृदय्यम् ॥ Here ष्यङ् is added as हृदय belongs to _Brahmanadi_ class (V. I. I24). When हृद् is substituted there is _Vriddhi_ of both the members सु and हृ by (VII. 3. 19). So also हृद्रोगः or हृदयरोगः ॥ All these forms could have been got from हृत् which is a full word sui generis, having the same meaning as हृदय ॥ The substitution taught in this _sutra_ is rather unnecessary.",

So also पदगः = पादाभ्यां गच्छति; पदोपहतः = पादेनोपहतः ॥ पाद belongs to _Vrishadi_ class (VI. I. 203) and has therefore acute on the first syllable, the पद् substitute however has acute on the final, only in the उपदेश (VI. I. 171), therefore in पदोपहतः, पद् retains its accent (VI. 2. 48), and it becomes acute on the final. While पदाजिः, पदातिः and पदगः have acute on the final (VI. I. 223) and _krit_-accent)).",

The word पाद in this _sutra_ means 'the actual foot', a part of animal organism. Therefore पद् is not substituted before the यत् of (V. I. 34), as द्विपाद्यम्, त्रिपाद्यम् because पाद here denotes, 'a measure'.",
    "63054": "Thus पद्धिमम्, (= पादस्य शीतं) पत्काषिन् (= पादचारिणः) as in अथ पत्काषिणा यान्ति, and पद्धतिः (पदाभ्यां हन्यते)॥",
    "63055": "Thus पच्छो गायत्रीं शंसति = पादं पादं शंसति, the affix शस् being added by (V. 4. 43). Why do we say 'when meaning a Hymn'? Observe पादशः कार्षापणं ददाति ॥",

    "63058": "Thus उदपेषं पिनष्टि formed by णमुल् by (III. 4. 38); उदवासः = उदकस्यवासः, so also उदवाहनः ॥ उदकं धीयतेऽस्मिन् = उदधिः 'a water jar'.",
    "63059": "Thus उदकुम्भः, or उदककुम्भः, उदपात्रम् or उदकपात्रम् ॥ The word एकहलादि means 'a word beginning with a single simple consonant'.

But when it means 'alone', then those rules will not apply. The word एक is exhibited in the _sutra_ without any case-affix as a _Chhandas_ irregularity. The examples given are of एका in the feminine which alone can be shortened, and not of एक whose final is already short. Nor can the rule of shortening be applied to ए of एक, for the rule applies to the final letter, and not to a vowel situeated in the body of a word.",

Therefore, when a word, denoting time, is the second member, सह would not be changed to स, because of the prohibition in (VI. 3. 81). The present _sutra_ removes that prohibition by anticipation, with regard to time-denoting words even, when the meaning is that 'of the end of a book'.

The vow of studying the _Veda_, is also called ब्रह्म ॥ He who is engaged in the performance of that vow is called ब्रह्मचारिन् ॥ समान refers to the vow, the vow of studying being common to both : i. e. समाने ब्रह्मणि व्रतचारी = सब्रह्मचारी ॥ According to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshit_ चरणे in the _sutra_ means a शाखा or a department of Vedic study.

Why do we say of विष्वग् and देव? Observe अश्वाची = अश्वमञ्चति, the feminine ङीप् being added by (IV. 1. 6) _Vartika_ The अ of अच् is elided by (VI. 4. 138.) and the final of अश्व is lengthened by (VI. 3. 138). Why 'when अञ्च् follows'? Observe विष्वग्युक् ॥ Why do we say 'when the affix व् follows'? Observe विष्वगञ्चनं ॥ The व is totally elided by (VI. 1. 67). Another reading of the _sutra_ is अप्रत्यये (अञ्चतावप्रत्यये). It would give the same result, the meaning then being when no affix follows. The word वप्रत्यये or अप्रत्यये indicates by implication that in other places where simply a verb is mentioned, it means a word-form beginning with that verb which ends with some affix. For had अप्रत्यये not been used, then the rule would have applied not only when _anch_ followed, but when _anchana_ ending in ल्युट् also followed. The maxim धातुग्रहणे तदादि विधिरिष्यते is illustrated in अयस्कृतं and अयस्कारः; for (VIII. 3. 46) teaches that _visarga_ is changed into स् when कृ follows. There the कृ denotes not only the root कृ but a word derived from कृ, therefore which begins with कृ, such as कारः and कृतः ॥ Therefore the rule applies to forms like अयस्कृत् which is followed merely by the verb कृ; as well as to forms like अयस्कृतः ॥\n\nVart:- In the Vedas, diversely before the feminine nouns: thus in \"विश्वाची व घृताची च\" there is no substitution in विश्वाची, but in कद्रीची there is this substitution. कद्रीची is derived from किम् + अञ्च् = कद्रि + अञ्च् ॥ Then is added ङीप् and then like अश्वाची ॥",

    "64001": "This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. Thus in (VI. 4. 2) is taught the lengthening of the vowel of a _samprasarana_ : as हूतः, जीतः, संवीतः ॥ That means that the vowel preceded by a consonant belonging to the stem is lengthened. Therefore in निर् + वेञ् + क्त = निरुक्तम्, the vocalised vowel उ is not lengthened, as निर् is _upasarga_ and not stem. So दुरुतम् ॥ Similarly (VI. 4. 3), teaches the lengthening of the final before नाम्, as अग्नीनाम्, वायूनाम् ॥ But क्रिमिणाम् पश्य, पामनां पश्य, as मि and म are not the end-portions of a stem. The stem is क्रिमिणा and पामना 'a female having क्रिमि or पामन्', formed by न affix (V. 2. 100). The forms क्रिमिणाम् and पामनाम् are Accusative Singular. Similarly (VII. 1. 9) teaches that after अ, भिस् is changed into ऐस् ॥ As वृक्षैः, प्लक्षैः ॥ There also, the अ must be the अ final in an _anga_ or stem : hence not here are ब्राह्मणभिस्सा, ओदनभिस्सदा, the भिस does not follow an _anga_. भिस्स means boiled rice and भिस्सदा means दधिः ॥\n\nThe maxim of अर्थवद्ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य does not apply here; for had it been so, there would have been no necessity of making this _sutra_. For example, in the _sutra_ नामि (VI. 4. 3), the affix नाम् having a meaning would have been meant, and not any other नाम् ॥\n\nThe word अङ्गस्य must be read in the following _sutras_, otherwise there would arise incongruity : first; _sutras_ teaching the lengthening of the vowel when सन् or _Samprasarana_ follows, thus : (VI. 4. 16) ordains the lengthening of vowel before सन्, as विवीषति; but not here दधि सनोति for इ of दधि is not that of _anga_. So also in _Samprasarana_, but not in निरुक्त &c as shown above.\n\n2andly -- For the purposes of एत्वं in _sutra_ (VI. 4. 68). The optional change of आ into ए must refer to _anga_, as ग्लेयात् or ग्लायात्, but not here निर्यायात् or निर्वायात्, for here र् is not part of the _anga_, and so र्य cannot be considered a conjunct part of _anga_.\n\n3rdly -- For the change of तु to तात् in (VII. 1. 35). There also तु must be portion of the _anga_, and not the particle तु, therefore, जीवतु or जीवतात्, but hot here जीव तु त्वम् ॥\n\n4thly -- For the substitution of इयङ् and उवङ् in (VI. 4. 77). Therefore not here श्यर्थम् and वर्यम् ॥\n\n5thly -- For the sake of नुट् augment in (VII. 1. 54). But not here are कुमारी आमिति आह ॥\n\n6thly -- For the sake of shortening of vowels. Thus (VII. 4. 13) ordains the shortening of अण् vowels before क ॥ It refers to the _anga_-vowel, as कुमारिका ॥ But not here, कुमारी कस्मै स्पृहयति or कुमार्याः कं सुखं = कुमारीकं ॥\n\nAnd lastly for तत्व or त substitution. Thus (VII. 4. 48) ordains the change of प् into त् in the case of अप् before भ ॥ It refers to _anga_, as अद्भिः ॥ But not here अद्भारः, for अप् here is not _anga_.\n\nTo sum up in Sanskrit : सन् सम्प्रसारण दीर्घत्वैत्वतातार्ङयङुवङ्नुट ह्रस्वत्व तत्वे च अङ्गस्येत्यधिकारे प्रयोजनं ॥\n\nThe word अङ्गस्य is in the Genitive case. But the force of Genitive is here not only that taught in (I. 1. 49) (स्थाने योगः), but of mere relation-ship. Or अङ्गस्य may be considered as a mere _pratipadika_, without any case-affix. In the subsequent aphorisms, it should be read with proper case-affixes as the exigencies of each _sutra_ may require. Thus in अतो भिस ऐस् (VII. 1. 9) अङ्ग should be read in the ablative case: अकारान्ताद् अङ्गाद् भिसः ऐस् ॥ The Genitive case has force of स्थानषष्ठी in _sutras_ like हन्तेर्ज, where the whole of हन् is replaced (VI. 4. 36). It has the force of अवयवषष्ठी in _sutras_ like ऊदुपधाया गोहः (VI. 4. 89). It has the force of निमित्तनिमित्ति सम्बन्धः in युवोरनाकौ (VII. 1. 1).

Observe तृतीयः ॥ Here त्रि has been vocalised into तृ, ऋ being substituted for र् before the affix तीय (V. 2. 55). There ऋ will not be lengthened.

Thus हन् is a noun formed by the addition of the affix क्विप् to the root हन्; and the affix _Kvip_ is added to it only then, when it is preceded by another word like \"_Brahma_\" &c. See (III. 2. 87). Similarly the words पूषन् and अर्यमन् are masculine and cannot take the Neuter plural affix शि in their original state. They must be parts of a neuter compound, to admit this affix. Hence we have used words \"when the stem ends in इन् &c.\"\n\nThus बहुदण्डीनि and बहुच्छत्रीणि । बहुवृत्रहाणि । बहुभ्रूणहाणि । बहुपूषाणि । बह्वर्यमाणि ॥ सिद्धे सत्यारम्भो नियमार्थः । इन्हन्पूषार्यम्णामुपधायाः शावेव दीर्घो भवति नान्यत्र । दण्डिनौ ॥ छत्रिणौ । वृत्रहणौ । पूषणौ । अर्यमणौ ॥\n\nThough this result could have been obtained by (VI. 4. 8), the special mention of these words shows that except in Accusative and Nominative Plural the lengthening does not take place in other strong cases. As दण्डिनौ, छत्रिणौ, वृत्रहणौ, पूषणौ, अर्यमणौ ॥\n\n_Karika_ :- Regarding the rule of lengthening taught about इन् &c here, let the wise reader, after making a restrictive rule with regard to सुट् (_sarvanamasthana_) affixes in general, make again another rule regarding the affix शि in particular, (i. e., make a _yoga_-_vibhaga_) By so doing, the form भ्रूणहनि (Locative singular) of the _Acharya_, will not be found fault with.\n\n2. (But if _yoga_-_vibhaga_ be not made) then I rule that the _anuvritti_ of सुट् being dropped, let the rule be made with regard to शि affix in general (without regarding it as a _Sarvanamasthana_ affix). And as the rule of lengthening applies to penultimates, there would arise no fault, if the vowel of हन् is lengthened before the demonstrative affix य (in words like वृत्रहायते = वृत्रहा इव आचरति, This refers to (VII. 4. 25)).\n\n3. Or if the _anuvritti_ of सुट् (_Sarvanamasthana_) be taken into this _Sutra_, because of the context, then the mention of शि in this _Sutra_, (would be redundant, because the word _Sarvanamasthana_ includes it, so far as the strong cases are concerned) but it would find scope and utility in preventing the lengthening in those cases to which the context of _Sarvanamasthana_ does not apply. That is, the _Sarvanamasthana_ will be restricted with regard to इन् &c to the affix शि and not to सुट् affixes generally.\n\nNote :- शि is the affix of the Nominative and Accusative Plural in Neuter (VII. 1. 20). It is a _Sarvanamasthana_ by (I. 1. 42). But the word _Sarvanamasthana_ may be read into this _sutra_ from the preceding (VI. 4. 8). What is then the necessity of employing शि in this? The above _karika_ answers this.\n\nIn the case of हन् ending words, the subsequent rule (VI. 4. 15), which required the lengthening of the penultimate vowel before an affix having an indicatory क् or ङ्, is however debarred by the present restrictive rule. Thus the Locative Singular (ङि) is वृत्रहनि, and भ्रूणहनि ॥ How do you make this? By splitting up the present _sutra_ into two parts, the first part being इन् हन् पूषार्यम्णाम्, and the second being शौ ॥ It would then mean :- (1) The penultimate vowel is lengthened, in strong cases only and no where else, when the stem ends in इन् or हन् or in पूषन् or अर्यमम् ॥ (2) So also it is lengthened before the strong case शि and no where else. These two restrictive rules therefore, would debar all other rules of penultimate lengthening which would otherwise have been applicable. But a rule which does not relate to penultimate vowel, is not debarred by this restriction, but does take effect. Thus वृत्रहायते, भ्रूणहायते denominative verbs in क्यङ् ॥ \n\nOr even though the _Sarvanamasthana_ may be read into the _sutra_ by _anuvritti_, yet this may be considered a Restrictive Rule in general, and not only with regard to शि considered a _Sarvanamasthana_ or a Neuter affix शि is the _Sarvanamasthana_ affix of the Neuter : which has no other _Sarvanamasthana_, therefore, it is a general _Niyama_ and not only a _Sarvanamasthana_ or a Neuter _niyama_. Therefore in this _niyama_ the word \"नपुंसकस्य\" - \"of the Neuter\" - is not to be taken.\n\nFor if it be taken, then the _Sutra_ would mean, the neuter stems in इन् &c are lengthened in शि only and no where else. The result would be that in examples like भ्रूणहनि ब्राह्मणकुले (locative singular), there would be no lengthening at all (i.e. we shall never have the form भ्रूणहानि in locative singular by force of (VI. 4. 15); moreover, by so doing, there would arise this anomaly also, that words other than Neuter would also not be lengthened.\n\nThe force of the definition of _Sarvanamasthana_ applies to Neuter also in certain cases, therefore, any rule (_niyama_) made with regard to _Sarvanamasthana_ would apply to Neuter also.",

    "64016": "Thus of roots ending in vowel we have :- विवीषति, तुष्टूषति, चिकीर्षति, जिहीर्षति (VII. 1. 100); of हन् and गम्, जिघांसति, and अधिजिगांसते ॥\n\nVart:- The rule applies to that गम् which is the substitute of इङ् (II. 4. 48) 'to study'. Therefore, not here, संजिगंसते वत्सो मात्रा (cf. (VII. 2. 58)); In the _Veda_ we read स्वर्गे लोकं समजिगांसत्, where though गम् means 'to go' and is not, therefore, the substitute of इङ्, the lengthening takes place by the rule (VI. 3. 137). Or the word अच् should not be added in the _sutra_ at all: which should be read as हनगमां सनि meaning \"There is lengthening of the stem when the Desiderative सन् follows\". This would apply of course, to vowel-ending stems, because the sentence would mean that, for there cannot be lengthening of a consonant. This will apply to गम् also, in this way :-\" A stem ending in a vowel is lengthened in the Desiderative, and so also of गम् which is a substitute of the vowel-stem इ\" ॥ In this way, we may see, that there is no necessity of the _Vartika_.",
    "64017": "Thus तितांसति or तितंसति ॥ But in तितनिषति no alternative is allowed, as इट् is added to सन् by (VII. 2. 49) _Vartika_: optionally.",
    "64018": "Thus क्रन्त्वा or क्रान्त्वा; but क्रमित्वा only, with इट् augment. But when क्त्वा is replaced by ल्यप्, the rule does not apply: as प्रक्रम्य, उपक्रम्य ॥ This is on the maxim अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गोल्यप् बाधते \"a _bahiranga_ substitution of ल्यप्' supersedes even _antaranga_ rule\".",
    "64019": "Thus प्रश्नः, विश्नः from प्रच्छ and विच्छ, with the affix नङ् (III. 3. 90) the च्छ being replaced by श ॥ Similarly from the root सिव् we have स्थोनः thus: सिव् + न (_Unadi_ III. 9). = सि + ऊ + न = स्थू + न = स्थोनः (VII. 3. 84). Here the ऊ is added to the stem prior to the scope being given to the _guna_ rule of (VII. 3. 86), otherwise the form would be सिव्  + न = सेव् + न = से + ऊ + न ॥ Having thus added ऊ, before scope could be given to the _guna_ rule (VII. 3. 86), we make _sandhi_ of सि + ऊ = स्थू, because semivowel substitution is _antaranga_ operation and of wider scope than _guna_, and the maxim of वार्णादाङ्ग बलीयो भवति has no scope here. \"An operation which is taught in the _Angadhikara_, and affects the _anga_ or stem, possesses force than an operation which concerns a combination of letters (i. e. is taught in a _sandhi_ rule)\".\n\nWith क्वि we have शब्दप्राश् formed with क्विप् (_Unadi_ 11.57 ) added to प्रच्छ, there is no vocalisation of the semivowel र, and there is lengthening of अ, and च्छ changed to श. So also गोविश् ॥\n\nOf the change of व into ऊ we have the following :- अक्षद्यूः, हिरण्यद्यूः (दिव् + क्विप् = दि + ऊ = द्यूः) ॥ Here the ऊ substitution is _Bahiranga_, and दि + ऊ = द्यू, the change of इ into य is _antaranga_, therefore on the maxim of असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे (a _bahiranga_ is non-existent for the purposes of an _antaranga_); there should be no change of इ into य, for ऊ is non-existent. That maxim is however set aside by नाजानन्तर्ये बहिष्ट्व प्रक्लृप्तिः \"A _bahiranga_ operation is not regarded as _bahiranga_, and consequently _asiddha_, when an _antaranga_ operation is to take effect, which depends on the immediate sequence of a vowel and something else\".\n\nSo also before a _jhaladi_ affix; as प्रच्छ + क्त = पृष्टः, पृष्टवान् (क्तवतु), पृष्ट्वा (क्त्वा); here च्छ is changed to श, there is vocalisation by (VI. 1. 16), and श changed to ष by (VIII. 2. 36).\n\nSo also व is changed to ऊ as, द्यूतः, द्यूतवान्, द्यूत्वा ॥\n\nWhen the affixes are not ङित् or कित्, the rule does not apply: as द्युभ्याम्, द्युभिः ॥ Some do not read the _anuvritti_ of कित् and ङित् into this _sutra_, and explain द्युभ्याम् and द्युभिः by (VI. 1. 131) : उ short being substituted for व of दिव् ॥\n\nIn \"छशां ष\" (VIII. 2. 36) the letter छ should not be taken, because by the force of the present _sutra_, श is ordained to come every where in the place of छ ॥\n\nThe indicatory ठ् in ऊठ् is for the sake of distinguishing this ऊ in _sutras_ like एत्ये धत्यूठ् सु (VI. 1. 89). In the _sutra_ वाह ऊंठ् (VI. 4. 132) there is also indicatory ठ् ॥",

    "64022": "This is an _adhikara_ rule. The above translation is given according to Prof. Bohtlingk. According to _Kasika_ the असिद्धवत् extends up to the end of the chapter. Dr. Ballantyne translates it thus :-\"The rules, reckoning from this one to the end of the chapter, are called _Abhiya_, because the chapter ends with a series of rules dependant on the aphorism '_bhasya_' (VI. 4. 129). When that (i. e. one of the _abhiya_ rules) is to be brought into operation, having the same place for coming into operation as another _abhiya_, which has already taken effect, that one which has taken effect, shall be regarded as not having taken effect\".\n\nThe word आभात् means 'up to भ' i. e. upto (VI. 4. 129). in which last _sutra_ the word भ occurs : i. e. in applying the rules taught upto (VI. 4. 129). The word अत्र shows that the two rules must have the same आश्रय or place of operation, where their places of operation are different, they are not _asiddha_ to each other. The word असिद्ध shows that an _utsarga_ or general rule must take effect, as if existing in spite of a special rule, and that an '_adesa_' or substitution taught by another rule should not be considered to have taken effect in applying the special rule. Thus in forming एधि and शाधि (Imperative 2nd person) ए is first substituted for अस् 'to be' by (VI. 4. 119): and for शास् by (VI. 4. 35) and then is धि added by (VI. 4. 101). The latter rule says that धि is added in the Imperative, only after those roots which end in a consonant of झल् class. Now अस् and शास् end in a _jhal_ consonant, and can take धि, but their substitute ए and शा end in a vowel and not a consonant and should not take धि ॥ The present rule helps us here, and for the application of धि (V1.4. 101) the substitution of ए for अस् or शा for शास् should be considered as _asiddha_ or not to have taken effect. Similarly in आगाहि (Vedic Imperative, शप् being elided by (II. 4. 73) and जहि from गम् and हन्, the nasal being elided in the case of गम्, (VI. 4. 36) and ज being substituted for हन् (VI. 2. 36) we have the stems आग and ज, which ending in अ would require the elision of हि by (VI. 4. 105). But since the change of ज &c is not regarded as having been accomplished, the elision of हि does not take place.\n\nWhy do we say आभात् 'up to (VI. 4. 12)'? In applying any other rule the changes ordained by _abhiya_ rules would not be considered as _asiddha_. Thus अभाजि and रागः from भञ्ज् and रञ्ज् ॥ Here the nasals of _ranj_ and _bhanj_ have been elided by (VI. 4. 27) – (VI. 4. 28) and (VI. 4. 33) before the affixes घञ् and चिण् respectively, and we have the stems रज्, and भज् to which rule (VII. 2. 116) applies and we have _Vriddhi_ of अ preceding the final consonant. Had the elision of the nasal been considered as non-effective for the purposes of (VII. 2. 116), then अ could not have taken _Vriddhi_, as it would not then be उपधा or penultimate.\n\nWhy do we use the word अत्र in the aphorism? The rules are _asiddha_ to each other with regard to a common place of operation and not otherwise. Thus पा + वस् (क्वसु) + अस् (शस् Accusative Plural ). =  पपा + उस् + अस् ((VI. 4. 131) vocalisation of व). If this उ substitute be considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of _sutra_ (VI. 4. 64), then we cannot elide the आ of पा, because आ is not then followed by a vowel (उ being non-existent). उ however is not considered as _asiddha_, and आ being thus elided, we have पपुषः in पपुषः पश्य ॥ Similarly चि+ वस् + अस् = चिचि + उस् + अस् ॥  Here also उ is not considered _asiddha_, and we apply rule (VI. 4. 82), and substitute य for उ as चिच्युषः पश्य ॥ Similarly लू + वस् + अस् = लुलू + उस् + अस् = लुलुवुषः ॥ Here also  उ is not considered _asiddha_, and we change the ऊ of लू into उव् by (VI. 4. 77). In all the above three cases, the elision of आ, or change of इ to य, or of ऊ to उव्, takes place in reference to वस्, while the _samprasarana_ of व takes place with reference to the Accusative plural case-ending अस् which makes the stem _Bha_. So they have not the same आश्रय ॥ Nor does the maxim of असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे apply here, because the special maxim of _Abhiya_ governs the _sutras_ of this section, so there cannot be the relation of _Antaranga_ and _Bahiranga_ among these _sutras_, simultaneously with their being _asiddha_ to each other.\n\nVart:- The substitute वुक् (VI. 4.88), and युट् (VI. 4. 63) should however be considered as not _asiddha_, and rule (VI. 4. 77) teaching उवङ् and (VI. 4. 82), teaching य् substitution should not be applied simultaneously with them. Thus भू-बभूव, बभूवतुः बभूवः with वुक्, and उपदिदीये, उपदिदीयाते, उपदिदीयिरे with युट् of (VI. 4. 63). In the case of भू, when वुक् is added, there is not the addition of उवङ्, and in the case of दीङ्, when युट् is added, there is not यणादेश ॥\n\nThe आ in आभात् has the force of limit inclusive, so that, the _asiddha_ rule applies to the _sutras_ governed by भ ॥",

Observe यज्ञानाम्, यत्नानाम्, where the न of नाम् is not elided after the न of यज्ञ and यत्न, the lengthening of अ by (VII. 3. 102) being _sthanivat_ would not have prevented the elision. In the case of विश्नानाम् and प्रश्नानाम् (formed by विश्न + नाम् and प्रश्न + नाम्) also, the न of नाम् is not elided after श्न of विश्न ॥ For the श्न of the _sutra_ is the technical श्न the _vikarana_, and not any combination of the letters श and न ॥ The _pratipadokta_ maxim applies here. लक्षणप्रतिपदोक्तयोः प्रतिपदोक्तस्यैव ग्रहणम् ॥",

But नन्द्यते and नानन्द्यते, then न् is not elided, the root being written in the _Dhatupatha_ as टुणदि समृद्धौ, and न being added by (VII. 1. 58). Why do we say ending in a consonant? Observe नीयते, नेनीयते from नी which has a penultimate nasal, but ends in a vowel. Why do we say 'penultimate'? Observe नह्यते, नानह्यते ॥ Why do we say having an indicatory क or ङ?

Thus the final अ of the verbal stem चिकीर्ष is elided before the _ardhadhatuka_ affix तृ, as चिकीर्षितृ, जिहीर्षितृ, but the final अ is not elided before a _sarvadhatuka_ affix, as the अ of भव in भवति, भवतः ॥ The _luk_-elision of शप् after roots of अदादि class, implies that there is never _lopa_ of शप् ॥\n\nThe following purposes are served by this _sutra_, i. e. an _ardhatuka_ affix causes the following special changes (1) अतोलोपः - The elision of अ of a stem, as shown above, in चिकीर्षिता, चिकीर्षितुम्, (2) यलोपश्च, The elision of य by (VI. 4. 49), (VI. 4. 50) : as बेभिदिता, बेभिदितुम्, बेभिदितव्यम् from बेभिद्य the Intensive stem.

By (VII. 2. 15) read with (VII. 2. 49), ज्ञप् is a root which takes no इट् augment in the _Nishtha_. It may be objected that (VII. 2. 15) preventing इट् augment applies to verbs of one syllable (VII. 2. 10), and the causative ज्ञपि being of two syllables will always have इट् in the _Nishtha_, and so it is useless to use the word सेटि in the _sutra_. The word सेटि in the _sutra_ fixes the time when the elision of णि should take place. Namely, first there should be added the augment इट् and then, there should take place the elision of णि ॥ Otherwise we shall have this difficulty कारि + त, here let us elide the णि first : and we get कार् + त, now we cannot add इट् to त, for कार् being a verb of one syllable will not take इट् by (VII. 2. 10).

Similarly वेभिद्य is the Intensive root, its य is elided by (VI. 4. 49), this elision is not considered as _asiddha_, if it were _asiddha_, the इ of भि would not be _laghu_.

The stems having now assumed a form in which they begin with a vowel, take आट् ॥ The addition of tense-affixes being an _antaranga_ operation precedes the addition of augment. After the affixes have been added, the _vikarana_ यक, being _nitya_, is added and precedes in order the augment, the latter being so far _anitya_; after यक् addition the roots assume a form in which we can add आट् ॥ Why आट् is considered _anitya_ depends on the following maxim :- शब्दान्तरस्य प्राप्नुवन् विधिरनित्यो भवति \"when the word-form in reference to which a rule teaches something; after the taking effect of another rule that applies simultaneously would be different from what it was before that other rule had taken effect, then the former rule is not _nitya_.\"",

This will then be a limited option only (_vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_). The forms उत्क्रामयति and संक्रामयति are thus explained.",
    "64093": "Thus अशमि or अशामि, अतमि or अतामि with चिण्; and शमंशमम्, and शामंशामं; तमंतमम् or तामंतामम् with णमुल् ॥ Why have we used the word दीर्घ in the _sutra_? The rule does not teach merely the optional shortening. So that in the alternative of short, we have अशमि and in the other alternative we have अशामि, so that there is long. For had दीर्घ not been used, it would have taught optional short only, i. e. it would be a ह्रस्वविकल्पविधि only, and there will be this difficulty :- when the causative of causative is taken, as in शमयन्तं प्रयुङ्क्ते, there would not be lengthening in the alternative. Because the _lopa_ substitute of णि would be _sthanivat_ : therefore, the णि which would be followed by चिण् or णमुल्, would not have in it the मित् _anga_, because the first णि intervenes between the मित् _anga_ and the चिण् and णमुल् affix, and that णि which is preceded by a मित् _anga_ is not followed by चिण् and णमुल्, because the second णि (though elided) intervenes. Therefore, there would not be optional short here, but compulsory short, by the preceding _sutra_ and no lengthening. The rule, therefore, teaches the optional substitution of the long (दीर्घ). For there arises no such anomaly in this view. For taking this rule to be a दीर्घविधि, the _lopa_-substitution of णि would not be _sthanivat_, by the express prohibition contained in (l. 1. 58), and so we can get forms of double causatives. But if we take it a ह्रस्वविकल्पविधि, then the _lopa_-_adesa_ of णि being _sthanivat_, would prevent getting the alternative long form. Therefore the word दीर्घ is used in the _sutra_ to make this rule a दीर्घविधि, and prevent _sthanivat_-_bhava_. Thus take the causative of शम्, which will be शमि by the last _sutra_. Take its Intensive with यङ्, शमि + यङ् which causes doubling by (VI. 1. 9) = शमि शमि + यङ् = शशमि + यङ् (VII. 4. 60) = शं शमि + यङ् (नुक् or nasal being added to the _abhyasa_ by (VII. 4. 85)) = शंशमि + यङ् = शंशम् + य (VI. 4. 51) = शंशम्य. Add णिच् to this i. e. make the causative of the Intensive. शंशम् + य + इ ॥ Then the अ of य is elided by (VI. 4. 48) = शं शम् + य् + इ. Then य् is elided by (VI. 4. 49) = शंशम् + इ = शंशमि ॥ This शंशमि is the causative root of the Intensive of the causative शम् ॥ Now add चिण् or णमुल् to this root; and we get two forms short and long अशंशमि or अशंशामि with चिण् and शंशमम् or शंशामम् with णमुल् ॥ The long forms could not have been obtained had this not been a दीर्घविधि, for then the _lopa_-_adesa_ of णिच् being _sthanivat_ would have prevented the application of दीर्घ ॥ The roots शम् and तम् (both _Divadi_) ending in म् do not ever lengthen the root vowel before चिण् and णमुल् by (VII. 3. 34). The present _sutra_, therefore, does not apply to the simple roots. The derivative causative roots of these, namely, शमि - शमयति, तमि – तमयति, optionally lengthen the penultimate before these affixes. Thus शमि + चिण् = शम् + चिण् (the इ of णि being elided by VI. 4. 51) शामि or शमि (with the augment अ = अशामि or अशमि) ॥ This rule applies when the Causative of the Causative root takes these affixes. In fact, the mention of the word दीर्घ implies as much, otherwise the _sutra_ could have been made without this word, for the word 'optionally' would have brought in both 'short' and 'long'. Thus in शमयन्तं प्रयुङ्क्ते 'he causes another to make quiet,' we add णि (the Causative sign.), to the Causative root शमि, as शमि + णि = शम् + इ (VI. 4. 51) = शामि, the _lopadesa_ here is not _sthanivat_ for the purposes of lengthening (दीर्घविधि) the अ of शम् (I. 1. 58) ॥ From this शामि with चिण् we get अशामि, and with णमुल् we get शामम् ॥ But we cannot get the short forms, by taking the other alternative, as the _lopadesa_ will then be _sthanivat_. Hence the necessity of the word दीर्घ in the _sutra_. Thus the चिण् and णमुल् forms of the Causative of the Causative (i.e. the double Causative) of शम् are अशमि or अशामि; शमंशमम् or शामंशामम् and from the form शंशमयति, we have अशंशमि or अशंशामि, शंशमंशंशमम् or शंशामंशंशामम् ॥ These latter are from the Causative stems of the Intensive root. The sign यङ् of the Intensive has been elided (VI. 4. 49) as shown above.",

This form could have been evolved by simple _samprasarana_ thus : प्रष्ठ + वह् + शस् = प्रष्ठ + उह् + अस् (VI. 1. 108) = प्रष्ठ + ओह् + अस् (the affix ण्वि (III. 2. 64), will produce _guna_) = प्रष्ठौहः (VI. 1. 88). In fact ण्वि is never added to वह् (III. 2. 64) unless the preceding member ends in अ and that अ + ओ of वा will always produce औ ॥ The making of this special _samprasarana_ in ऊठ्, indicates the existence of following maxim: असिद्धं बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्गे; and the _samprasarana_ being a _bahiranga_ operation, is considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of _guna_ which is an _antaranga_ operation : therefore, we can never get the form ओह ॥",

The word एव 'only' is for the sake of perspicuity. अहन् alone does not lose its final अन् before ट and ख, other stems also do the same. This we infer, from the exception made in the case of _atman_ and _adhvan_, before ख in (VII. 4. 169).",
    "64146": "Thus बाभ्रव्यः from बभ्रू, माण्डव्यः from मण्डु, शङ्कव्यं दारु (from शंकु), पिचव्यः कार्पासः, (from पिचु) कमण्डलव्या मृत्तिका (from कमण्डलू), परशव्यमयः, औपगवः, कापटवः &c. Instead of making the _sutra_ simpler by saying ओरोत् 'let ओ be substituted for उ or ऊ', the employment of the technical phrase गुणः in the aphorism indicates the existence of the following maxim संज्ञा पूर्वको विधिरनित्यः \"A rule is not universally valid, when that which is taught in it, is denoted by a technical term\". The present _sutra_ is, therefore, _anitya_, and we have forms like स्वायंभुवः from स्वयंभू without _guna_. See (VII. 4. 30) also.",

    "64148": "Thus दाक्षी, प्लाक्षी, सखी from दाक्षि, प्लाक्षि and सखि with the feminine affix ई (IV. 1. 65) The above forms could also have been evolved by the simple rules of _sandhi_, as दाक्षि + ई = दाक्षी ॥ It might be asked, where was then the necessity of eliding इ? There would arise difficulty in the forms like अति सखि ॥  From the word सखी formed by ङीष् under (IV. 1. 62), we form the compound सखीमतिक्रान्तः = अतिसखि, the final becoming short by (I. 2. 48) (the _samasanta_ affix टच् is not added here as required by (V. 4. 91), that rule applying to the masculine form सखि and not to the feminine सखी). Now if in forming सखि + ई = सखी, had we not elided the letter इ of खि, then the long  ई being the single substitute for both इ + ई, would be considered as like the final इ of सखि by (VI. 1. 85). That being so, the word अतिसखि would be considered a non-घि word by (I .4. 7), for सखि has been specifically excluded form घि class. Not being a घि, we cannot have the form अतिसखेः in the Ablative and Genitive singular. Hence the necessity of eliding इ before the feminine ई, so that the _ekadesa_ rule (VI. 1. 85), should not apply.\n\nThe short इ is elided before _Taddhita_ affixes:- दुलि – दौलेयः, वलि – वालेयः, अत्रि – आत्रेयः ॥ अ is elided before ई as :- कुमार – कुमारी, गौर – गौरी, शार्ङ्गरव – शार्ङ्गरवी ॥ अ and आ are elided before the _Taddhita_ :- दक्ष - दाक्षि, प्लक्ष – प्लाक्षिः, चूड – चौडिः, बलाका – बालाकिः, सुमित्रा – सौमित्रिः ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of ई (शी), when it is the substitute of औ (VII. 1. 18), being the case-affix of the nominative, and accusative dual in the neuter, and of certain feminine in long आ ॥ Before this ई, the preceding vowel, इ and अ are not elided. The stem before this ई is also _bha_ by (I .4.18) in the case of Neuter nouns. Thus काण्ड + ई = काण्डे; कुड्ये ॥ सौर्य + ई = सौर्ये (the य would have been elided by (VI. 4. 149). It is owing to this _Vartika_, that we have inserted the word 'feminine' in the translation of the _sutra_. This may also be done by reading the _anuvritti_ of श्यां (VI. 4. 136), and न (VI. 4. 137) into this _sutra_.\n\nVart:- इयङ् and उवङ् are superseded, when they would apply simultaneously with this _lopa_. Thus इयङ् and उवङ् have unimpeded scope in श्री or भ्रू + औ or अस् (जस्), as श्रियौ, श्रियः, भ्रुवौ, भ्रुवः ॥ _Lopa_ has unimpeded scope in कमण्डलू – कामण्डलेयः (with ढञ् (IV. 1. 135)), and भाद्रवाहेयः ॥ But in वत्सप्री + ढञ् (IV. 1. 135), both the rules (VI. 4. 77) and (VI. 4. 148), present themselves. The former is superseded, and we have वात्सप्रेयः (वत्सं प्रीणाति = वत्सप्रीः, तस्यापत्यं); so also लैखाभ्रेयः with the ढक् affix, this word belonging to _Subhradi_ class (IV. 1. 123).",
    "64149": "Thus सूर्येणैकादिक् = सौरी (सूर्य + अण् under (IV. 3. 112) = सौर्य, then ई of ङीप् = सौरी), as सौरी बलाका ॥\n\nSo also तिष्य – तैषमहः, तैषी रात्रिः ॥ So also अगस्त्यस्यापत्यं स्त्री = आगस्ती (IV. 1. 114), आगस्तीयः; So also मत्स्य – मत्सी with ङीष् as it belongs to _Gauradi_ class (IV. 1. 40). If the words सूर्य &c, were to be qualified by the word भ, then the _sutra_ would mean सूर्यादीनां भसंज्ञानां \"of सूर्य &c, when they get the designation of भ\"; and the result of this interpretation would be, that the rule would apply to cases like सूर्यस्य स्त्री = सूरी, आगस्त्यस्य स्त्री = आगस्ती &c, only, where the forms सूर्य &c, are _Bha_, and not to their derivatives, as सौर्य &c: and there would not have been the forms like सौरी बलाका; because, here the word सूर्य is not _Bha_ before the affix ई, but the word सौर्य is _Bha_. Hence we have introduced the words \"and their derivatives\" in the translation, so as to cover the cases like सौरी बलाका ॥\n\nIn the last example, we again have an illustration, of the rule (VI. 4. 22), which says that for purposes of _asiddha_ the आश्रय must be the same. Thus सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + अ _lopa_ + ई = सौरी ॥ But सौर्य itself was formed by the elision of अ of सूर्य before the affix अण्, thus, सूर्य + अण् = सौर्य् + ० + सौर्य् (last _sutra_) = सौर्य ॥ But if this _lopa_ be considered as _asiddha_ by (VI. 4. 22), then we have the following equation सौर्य् + ० + अ (of अण्) + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ० (अ of अण् being elided by (VI. 4. 148) + ई ॥ Here य् cannot be elided, as it is not _upadha_ or penultimate: because the first _lopa_ is considered _asiddha_. But it is not to be so considered, as their scopes (आश्रय) are different. Hence we have the elision of य् by this _sutra_. It should not be objected that the य् here is not penultimate, but ultimate: as सौर्य + ई = सौर्य् + ० + ई (अ elided by the last _sutra_), and thus य् is ultimate. Here, however, rule (VI. 4. 22), applies. This elision of अ will be considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of the elision of य्, their scope being the same. So being considered _asiddha_, य् still retains its designation of _upadha_ and is elided by the present _sutra_. It should be remembered here, that we could not take help of the rule of _sthanivat_-_bhava_, because for purposes of यलोप, that rule is set aside. See (I. 1. 58).\n\nWhy do we say the penultimate य्? Observe मत्स्यचरी ॥ This word is thus formed. The affix चरट् is added to मत्सी by (V. 3. 53), in the sense of मत्सी भूतपूर्वा ॥ Then the मत्सी becomes masculine मत्स्य by (VI. 4. 35), and we have मत्स्यचर ॥ This word takes ङीप् by (IV. 1. 15), because it is formed by an affix having an indicatory ट् ॥ Thus मत्स्यचर + ई, and the word is भ, but the य is not elided, because it is not penultimate. The य has been read for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ : उपधायाः alone would have been enough for the purposes of this aphorism. The rule contained in this _sutra_ is rather too general; it is limited by the following _vartikas_, which enumerate the conditions under which the elision takes place.\n\nVart:- The य of मत्स्य is elided before the feminine ई only: therefore not here मत्स्यस्येदं मांसं = मात्स्यम् ॥  \n\nVart:-  Of सूर्य and अगस्त्य before the affixes छ, and ई (of the feminine): as सौरीयः, सौरी, आगस्तीयः, आगस्ती ॥ But not here सौर्यं चरुं निर्वपेत्, आगस्त्य formed with the Patronymic अण् (IV. I. 114)\n\nVart:- Of तिष्य and पुष्य when referring to asterisms, as, तिष्येण नक्षत्रेण युक्तः कालः = तैषः, पौषः (IV. 2. 3).\n\nVart:- Of अन्तिक before the affix तसि, the क is elided, and the word has acute on the first syllable : as, अन्तितः in अन्तितो न दूरात्(V. 4. 45).\n\nVart:- Before the affix तम, it loses the syllable तिक as well as क, as अन्तमः or अन्तितमः, in अग्रे त्वं नो अन्तिमः अन्तितमे अवरोहति ॥\n\nVart:- The elision of क of अन्तिक takes place diversely, before the second member also, as अन्तिके सीदति = अन्तिषत् (स changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 106))\n\nVart:- The elision takes place also before the affix य, as अन्तियः, this is found in the _Atharva_-_Veda_, (अन्तिके भवः, with the affix यत् (IV. 4. 110)).",

The science or work of _Atharvan_ _Rishi_ is also called _Atharvan_. He who studies that work is called _Atharvanika_: the final is not elided before the इक् affix. (4 and 5) The descendants of जिह्माशिन् and वासिन् are _Jaihmasineya_ and _Vasinayani_, the former with the affix ढक् of the _Subhradi_ class (IV. 1. 123), and the latter with the affix फिञ् of (IV. 1. 157). The finals of the stems are not dropped. (6 and 7) These are derived from भ्रूणहन् and धीवन् with the affix ष्यञ्, and न् being replaced by त = भ्रूणघ्नो भावः, धीव्नो भावः ॥ हन् takes त before affixes having an indicatory ण or ञ् by (VII. 3. 32): it might be said त would be added to भ्रूणहन् before ष्यञ् by that rule. That rule is, however, confined to affixes which come after roots only, and not to _Taddhita_ affixes. That rule does not apply to cases like भ्रौणघ्नी, वार्त्रघ्नः ॥ The त in _Bhraunhatya_ is therefore, an irregularity. (8) सारव is from सरयू with the affix अण्, the final अयू being elided, सरय्वां भवः = सारवमुदकं ॥ (9) The son of इक्ष्वाकु, with अञ् affix (IV. 1. 168), the final उ is elided, or ईक्ष्वाकुषु जनपदेष् भवः = ऐक्षाकः with अण् affix (IV. 2. 132). Accent on the first or the final. The irregularity consists in the elision of final उ ॥ As one word is ऐक्ष्वाकः and the other ऐक्ष्वाकः, the _sutra_ ought to have read this word twice, strictly speaking. The single reading may be justified on the ground, that the _sutra_ gives ऐक्ष्वाक without any accent (_eka_-_sruti_), and consequently includes both (एकश्रुतिः स्वर सर्वनाम) ॥\n\n(10) मैत्रेय is from मित्रयु of _Grishtyadi_ class (IV. 1. 136), and takes ढञ् as मित्रयु + एय, here (VI. 4. 146), requires _Guna_, but (VI. 4. 146), prevents it, and requires _lopa_ of उ, but (VII. 3. 2), required the substitution of इय for यु ॥ The irregularity consists in eliding यु altogether as मैत्रेय, the अ cannot be elided by (VI. 4. 148), before एय, as the _lopa_ of यु is considered _asiddha_ (VI. 4. 22); however the result is the same, for अ + ए = ए by (VI. 1. 97); the single substitute being the form of the subsequent. The plural of मैत्रेय will be मित्रयवः (the plural of मित्रयु); as it belongs or _Yaskadi_ class and loses the affix in the plural (II. 4. 63). Another form of this word is मैत्रेयिक formed under (VII. 3. 2). It might be objected that had मित्रयु been read in _Bidadi_ class (IV. 1. 104), it would have taken the affix अञ्, and the form मैत्रेय would have been evolved regularly: as मित्रयु + अञ् = मित्र + इय (VII. 3. 2) + अ = मैत्रेयः ॥ This would have prevented also the necessity of including this word in the _Yaskadi_ class (II. 4. 63), for then by (II. 4. 63), अञ् formed words would lose the affix in the plural and we would have got the form मित्रयवः in the plural. So far it would have been all right, but if मैत्रेय were to be formed with अञ् affix, as proposed, then the संघ derivative of this word would have required to be formed with अण् affix under (IV. 3. 127), and not with वुञ् under (IV. 3. 126); but we require वुञ्, as मैत्रेयकः संघः ॥ (11) हिरण्मय from हिरण्य with मयट् with the elision of य, हिरण्यस्य विकारः = हिरण्मयः ॥",

I. 133), as कृ+ण्वुल् = कारकः, हारकः ॥ So also वुन् (IV. 3. 98) as वासुदेवकः, अर्जुनकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say nasalised यु and वु ? Observe ऊर्णाया युस् (V. 2. 123) Here the यु is not replaced by अन, and we have ऊर्णायुः ॥ So also in भुजिमृङ्भ्यां युक्त्युकौ ॥ Here the यु of युक् and त्युक् (_Unadi_ III. 21) are not replaced by अन; as भुज्युः and मृत्युः ॥ In the affixes above mentioned, the semi-vowel is not considered to have the nasal. There are no visible marks of nasality on any affixes, but the maxim is प्रतिज्ञानुनासिक्याः पाणिनीयाः ॥\n\nThe word युवोः is the Genitive Singular of युवु considered as a single word, i.e. a _Samahara_ _Dvandva_ compound in the singular, and such compounds are always neuter (II. 4. 17). The Genitive Singular of युवु is therefore युवुनः the augment being added by (VII. I. 73). The anomalous form युवोः shows the existence of the maxim that a rule ordaining an augment is not universally valid (अनित्यमागमशासनम्) ॥ Or the युवु may be considered as masculine _Dvandva_, and then it proves the maxim that the gender need not be taught, the usage of the people settles the gender of a word (लिङ्गमशिष्यं, लोकाश्रयत्वाल्लिङ्गस्य)॥ If, however, युवू be considered an _itaretara_-_yoga_ _Dvandva_ compound, then its Genitive dual will be युव्वोः, one व् is elided as a _Chhandas_ irregularity, or the ऊ is elided, and we have the युव् + ओः = युवोः an anomalous dual.\n\n_Karika_ :- If युवू is taken as a dual, then there ought to be a semi-vowel (i.e. युव्वोः); if it is considered as Aggregate Singular, then it ought to be neuter, how is then युवोः masculine? (To this we answer), if it be taken as dual युवू, then there is elision of the यणादेश (i.e. व्); if it be taken as singular युवु, then the augment नुम् which comes in the Genitive Singular of Neuters, does not come here, proving that the rule of नुम् augment is _Anitya_ (not of universal application). Or the word युवु is taken as masculine, because the Gender depends upon usage.",

Observe उरुदघ्नम् जानुदघ्नम्, where घ is in the middle of the affix; and remains consequently unchanged.\n\nThese आयन &c, substitutions should be understood to have taken place at the very time the affixes फक् &c, are taught, and these substitutions being made, the rule of accent, which makes an affix acute on the first syllable, applies. Thus ख is not acute, but ई of ईन् substituted for it. Similarly in (IV. 4. 117), the affix taught is घच् with an indicatory च्, showing that the final of the affix इय will be acute (VI. 1. 163), and not of घ, for घ would have been acute by the general rule affix.\n\nIn शमेर्ढः (_Unadi_ 1.99), शमेः ख (_Unadi_ I: 102), the ढ  and ख remain unchanged, and we have शाण्डः, and शंखः ॥ This is explained on the maxim of उणादयो बहुलम् (III. 3. 1). In the _sutra_ ऋतेरीयङ् (III. 1. 29), the affix ईयङ् has been taught and not छङ्, this shows that the rule of substitution herein taught does not apply to the affixes to be added to the verbal roots. Thus एजेः खश् (III. 2. 28), पदरुजविशस्पृशो घञ् (III. 3. 16). Here the ख and घ are not be replaced by ईन and इय ॥ In fact, they cannot be regarded as affixes, but only as इत् or servile letters. By (I. 3. 8), the gutturals are इत् except in _Taddhita_ : therefore, the substitutions take place in _Taddhita_ affixes, where the ख and घ are not इत् ॥\n\nThe final म् in आयन् and इन् should not, however, be considered as servile (इत्) though they be final consonants. This we infer from the _sutra_ प्राचामवृद्धात् फिन् बहुलम् ॥ Here the न् of फिन् is indicatory, showing the position of the accent. But फ is replaced by आयन्, so if the न् of आयन् were also to be indicatory (इत्) there would have been no necessity of adding म् in फिन् ॥ Hence the fact of this न् in फिन् shows that the न् in आयन् and इन् are not इत् ॥",

The word अतिजर ends in अ, and there fore forms its Instrumental plural by ऐस् ॥ Thus अतिजर + ऐस् ॥ Now we apply (VII. 2. 101), which says for जरा is substituted जरस् before vowel-beginning case-endings. It should not be objected, that the substitution is ordained for जरा and not जर; for the maxim एकदेशविकृतमनन्यवद् भवति (a tail-less dog is still a dog) applies here. Having made this substitution, we get अतिजरसैः ॥ Nor should you object that it was the अ of जर which had given occasion to the existence of ऐस्, and that अ should not be destroyed, on the maxim संनिपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद् विघातस्य, for this maxim is not universal, as _Panini_ himself shows in employing the form कष्टाय (III. I. 14), in which ए of the Dative is changed into य by (VII. 1. 13), and then this very य causes the destruction of अ and makes it आ (See (VII. 1. 13) also).\n\n_Karika_:- If there be substitution of ए for the final  अ before the affix भिस् by the subsequent _sutra_ (VII. 3. 103), where will then the present _sutra_, causing the substitution of ऐस् for भिस् after stems ending in अ, find its scope, (because there will be no stem left ending in अ)? If even after changing अ into ए, you change the भिस् into ऐस्, because the ए was once अ (भौतपूर्व्यात्); then the rule of changing भिस् into ऐस् becomes a _nitya_ rule, because it takes effect even after the application of rule (VII. 3. 103), and being _nitya_ it debars that rule. Thus वृक्ष + भिस् ॥ Here the subsequent rule (VII. 3. 103), requires the अ to be changed into ए ॥ Thus वृक्षे + भिः Now the present rule cannot apply because there is no अदन्त stem. However, is considering that वृक्षे once was अदन्त, we change भिः to ऐस् then the rule becomes a _nitya_ rule. In fact, it is a _nitya_ rule and debars the application of (VII. 3. 103), within its jurisdiction, (VII. 3. 103), finds its scope in वृक्ष + सु = वृक्षेषु ॥",

    "71034": "Thus पपौ, तस्थौ, जग्लौ, मम्लौ, from पा, स्था, ग्लै (ग्ला) and म्लै (म्ला) ॥ The form पपौ is thus evolved, पा + णल् = पा + अ ॥ Here three operations simultaneously present themselves for application, namely; 1. Reduplication, 2. Lengthening; by the single substitution of one long vowel आ, for आ + अ; and 3. The substitution of औ for आ by the present _sutra_. In what order should these operations be then performed? First the affix अ should be replaced by औ, then the single substitution of औ for आ + औ ; and then treating it as _sthanivat_, and then reduplication. For if the single substitution of आ for आ + अ had taken place first, then there would be no scope for औ substitution, therefore the औ substitution, should take place first. Thus we have पा + औ = पौ; this _vriddhi_-_ekadesa_, is treated as _sthanivat_ by (I. 1. 59), and it causes reduplication. The _vriddhi_-_ekadesa_ should first take place (i. e. आ + औ = औ) and then the reduplication, because the former rule is subsequent to the latter.",
    "71035": "As जीवताद् भवान्, जीवतात् त्वम्, जीवतु भवान्, जीव त्वम् ॥ The ङ् prevents _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_, (I. 1. 4), and the substitute replaces the whole affix ((I. 1. 53) notwithstanding). The substitute is not _sthanivat_ पित्, though it replaces a पित् affix, because it has its own indicatory letter ङ्, and ङित् does not become पित्; and consequently in ब्रूतात् ई is not added to the affix, by (VII. 3. 93). ई being added only to पित् affixes after ब्रू ॥ When not denoting benediction, we have not this substitution : as ग्रामं गच्छतु भवान् or गच्छ ग्रामम् ॥\n\nThe affix तातङ् being a substitute of हि, is like हि, and, therefore, rules propounded with regard to हि, will apply to तातङ् also. Thus (VI. 4. 105) says that after stems ending in short अ, the हि is elided: therefore, after such words तातङ् should also be elided. Therefore we cannot get the form जीवतात् त्वम् for जीवत्वम् ॥ This objection, however, is futile; for, in the _sutra_ अतो हे (V1. 4. 105), there is the _anuvritti_ of हि from _sutra_ (VI. 4. 101) (हु झलभ्यो हेर्द्धिः) ॥ So that अतो हे should be construed as meaning \"there is the elision of हि when it is of the form हि, and not when it assumes the form तातङ्\" ॥\n\nThe object of ङ् in तातङ् is, as we have said above, for the sake of preventing _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_. It should not be said that the object of ङ् in तातङ् is for the sake of अन्त्यविधिः by the application of _sutra_ ङिच्च (1. 1. 53), just as the substitutes अनङ् &c (VII. 1. 93) and (VII. 1. 94) apply to the finals. For by so doing, तातङ् would replace only the उ of तु and the इ of हि, which is not desired. And the case of तातङ् is to be distinguished from अनङ्, for in अनङ् the ङ् has no other object but to prevent _sarvadesa_; but in तातङ् we see that ङ् has another object, namely, the prevention of _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_ ; and ङ् having thus found scope, the तातङ् substitute will be governed by the general rule अनेकाल् शित् सर्वस्य (I. 1. 55).\n\nThe _Karika_ given below raises these points.\n\n_Karika_ :-\n\nतातङि ङित्त्वं संक्रमकृत्स्यादन्त्यविधिश्चेत्तच्च तथा न ।\nहेरधिकारे हेरधिकारो लोपविधौ तु ज्ञापकमाह ॥\nतातङो ङित्त्वसामर्थ्यान्नायमन्त्यविधिः स्मृतः ।\nन तद्वदनङादीनां तेन तेऽन्त्यविकारजाः ॥\n\n_Karika_:- In तातङ् the ङ् is for the sake of preventing _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_ (संक्रम = गुणवृद्धिप्रतिषेधः)॥ If it be said, it is for the sake of अन्त्यविधि by (I. 1. 53); we say it is not so. (If you say that after roots ending in short अ, तात् should be elided, by (VI. 4. 105) read with (I. 1. 56), we reply): when the _anuvritti_ or _adhikara_ of हि was already existent in the _sutra_ (VI. 4. 105) from _sutra_ (VI. 4. 101), the express employment of हि in (VI. 4. 105), indicates that the _lopa_ rule does not apply to तातङ् ॥ (The _lopa_-rule not applying to तातङ्, it follows that it replaces the whole of हि and not only its final). The ङ् in तातङ् finds its scope in preventing _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_, therefore, it is not for the sake of _antya_ _vidhi_ (I. 1. 53). The ङित्व in अनङ् &c has no other scope, therefore, these substitutes replace the final only.",
    "71036": "Thus विद्वस् (nominative singular विद्वान्), विद्वांसौ, विद्वांसः ॥ The words formed with affixes having an indicatory उ or ऋ (उगित्) add a म् in their strong cases (VII. 1. 70), and form their feminine with unaccented ई ॥ शतृ is an affix having an indicatory ऋ, therefore its substitute would also be considered as having an indicatory ऋ, the उ of वसु therefore is not absolutely necessary for the purposes of उगित् operations. वसु is so written, in order that in the _sutra_ वसो संप्रसारणं (VI. 4. 131.), both क्वसु and वसु should be included. Nor can we object that in the above mentioned _sutra_, वसु with one indicatory letter being taken, cannot include an affix like क्वसु having two indicatory letters, -- on the maxim एकानुबन्धकग्रहणे न द्व्यनुबन्धकस्य -- for if that were so, there was no necessity of उ in वसु ॥ Some read the _anuvritti_ of the word optionally into this : and we have विदन्, विदन्तौ, विदन्तः formed with शतृ (see (V. 4. 38)).",
    "71037": "Thus प्रकृत्य, प्रह्रत्य ॥ The _tva_ is added by (III. 4. 21), the compounding is by (II. 2. 18), and तुक् by (VI. 1. 71). पार्स्वतः कृत्य, The _tva_ is added by (III. 4. 61). and compounding is by (II. 2. 22). नानाकृत्य; द्विधाकृत्य The _tva_ is added by (III. 4. 62). Why do we say 'in a compound'? Observe कृत्वा हुत्वा. Here the counter example is हृत्वा, which is preceded by an Indeclinable कृत्वा, but as it is not compounded, there is no substitution. Why do we say 'not preceded by नञ्'? Observe अकृत्वा, अहृत्वा, परमकृत्वा, उत्तमकृत्वा ॥ The word अनञ् means 'other than नञ्', and means words of the same class as नञ्, i. e. Indeclinables : and does not mean words which are not Indeclinables. The compounds like स्नात्वाकालक contained in the class of मयूरव्यंसक &c (II. 1. 72.), do not take ल्यप anomalously. Or the word समासे is in the Locative with the force of specification : and means those compounds which are specifically formed with क्त्वा and not any compound in general.\n\nNow by the rule (I. 1. 72), _ktva_ would denote a form ending with _ktva_; and would include the case of a compound ending in _ktva_. But this general rule is modified by the maxim प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहित स्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम् \"an affix denotes, whenever it is employed in grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added and ends with the affix itself.\" But the affix _ktva_ is never ordained after a compound. Therefore, the case of compounds ending in _ktva_, would not be covered by the mere employment of _ktva_. Then comes the imaxim कृद्ग्रहणे गति कारक पूर्वस्यापि ग्रहणं 'a _krit_ affix denotes whenever it is employed in grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that _krit_ affix has been added and which ends with the _krit_ affix, but moreover should a _gati_, or a noun such as denotes a case-relation have been prefixed to that word-form, then the _krit_ affix must denote the same word-form together with the _gati_ or the noun which may have been prefixed to it.\" By this a compound also may end in _ktva_. This maxim will cover cases like प्रकृत्य, पार्श्वतः कृत्य but not उच्चैः कृत्य &c because उच्चैः is neither a _gati_ nor a _karaka_. Hence the employment of the word समासे in the _sutra_, and also of the word अनञ्पूर्वे, for नञ् is neither a _Gati_ nor a _Karaka_.\n\nIn the case of प्रधाय and प्रस्थाय this maxim applies :-अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गो ल्यप् बाधते \"a _Bahiranga_ substitution of ल्यप् supersedes even _antaranga_ rule\". What are these _antaranga_ rules superseded by the substitute ल्यप्? (1) हित्वं - the substitution of हि for धा (VII. 4. 42). Thus हित्वा but प्रधाय and not प्रहित्वा ॥ (2) दत्वं - the substitution of दद् for दो (VII. 4. 46) – as दत्वा, but प्रदाय and not प्रदत्वा ॥ (3) आत्वं as required by (VI. 4. 42): as खात्वा, प्रखाय and प्रखन्य ॥ (4) इत्वं - as स्थित्वा but प्रस्थाय ॥ (5) ईत्वं by (VI. 4. 66), as पीत्वा but प्रपाय ॥ (6) दीर्घत्वं by (VI. 4. 15), as शान्त्वा but प्रशम्य ॥ (7) शुट् by (VI. 4. 19), as पृष्ट्वा but आपृच्छ्य ॥ (8) ऊठ् – as द्यूत्वा ॥ (9) इट् (VII. 2. 56) – देवित्वा but प्रदीव्य ॥",

Thus (III. 3. 103) says that आ is added in the feminine to a root which ends in a consonant and has a prosodially long vowel. The root कुडि must be considered to be such a root and कुण्डा, हुण्डा are thus formed. Similarly though the roots in the _Dhatupatha_ are धिवि and कृवि, in applying affixes we must consider them as धिन्व् and कृन्व्, as the author himself has indicated in (III. 1. 80). In short, in adding affixes, these roots should be considered as having न् ॥ Moreover the root (_dhatu_) should have इ, and not the stem (_anga_). The affixes तासि (Future) and सिच् (Aorist) when added to roots, will not make those roots इदित्; for the इ in तासि and सिच् is merely for the sake of pronunciation, and is not to be considered as इत् in the strict sense of the word: in fact it should be considered as non-nasalised. If you say that \"the इ in सिच् should be considered as इत्, for because of its being इत्, the न् of मन् is not elided by (VI. 4. 24) in अमंस्ता\", we reply, \"not so, the न् is not elided, because _sutra_ हनः सिच् (1. 2. 14) makes सिच् a कित् after हन् only, the result of which is that हन् only loses its न् by (VI. 4. 37), and no other root\". In मन्ता = मन् + तासि + डा = मन् + त् + आ (the आस् is elided (VI. 4. 143)). For the purposes of the elision of न्, the elided आस् would be considered as _asiddha_ (VI. 4. 22), for both (VI. 4. 143), and (VI. 4. 37), requiring the elision of न् are _abhiya_ _sutras_. In भेत्ता, छेत्ता from भिदिर् and छिदिर् the whole combination इर् is इत्, and not इ and र् separately, and hence नुम् is not added. But even if these roots be considered as इदित्, the syllable इर् having an इ, yet they will not get the नुम् augment, because the word अन्त of पादान्ते (VII. 1. 57) is understood here in this _sutra_ also, so that the roots must have a final इ as इत् for the application of this rule.",

    "71065": "As आलम्भ्यो गौः ॥ The नुम् is added before the addition of the affix, and by so doing लभ् becomes लम्भ् and thus loses its character of having a penultimate अ, and therefore by (III. 1. 124), we shall have ण्यत् affix, and not यत् affix by (III. 1. 98). Had the नुम् been added after the addition of the affix, then यत् would be added by (III. 1. 98). Though in both cases the form will be आलम्भ्या, the difference will be in the accent: यत् would throw the acute on the first syllable (यतोऽनावः) while the word has _svarita_ on the final; thus instead of आल꣡म्भ्या (by (VI. 1. 213) and (VI. 2. 139)), which यत् gives, we have आलम्भ्या॑ (तित् _svar_).\n\nWhy do we say 'when preceded by आ'?

Had it been in the Ablative, there would have been no necessity of using the word केवलं, for the rule would not have applied, when a preposition intervened between these and the root. In अतिसुलभम्, the word अति is not an _Upasarga_ but a _Karmapravachaniya_; when अति is used as an _Upasarga_, we have अतिसुलम्भः ॥ If the words सुदुर्भ्याम् be construed as Ablative, then also the use of केवल is for a purpose similar to that as above.",

    "71070": "Thus भवतु has an indicatory उ, formed by the _Unadi_ affix डवतुप्, and it is declined as भवान्, भवन्तौ, भवन्तः ॥ Similarly ईयसुन् - श्रेयान्, श्रेयांसौ, श्रेयांसः, शतृ - पचन्, पचन्तौ, पचन्तः ॥ अञ्च - प्राङ्, प्राञ्चौ, प्राञ्चः ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'having an indicatory उक् vowel or the stem अच्'? Observe दृषत्, दृषदौ, दृषदः ॥\n\nWhy do we say in strong cases? Observe भवतः पश्य, श्रेयसः पश्य ॥ अञ्च् root is mentioned for the sake of _niyama_, i.e. of the roots, only अञ्च् gets नुम् and no other root. Therefore उखास्रत्, पर्णध्वत् formed from the roots स्रंसु and ध्वंसु having indicatory उ ॥ (See (III. 2. 76), (IV. 1. 6), (VIII. 2. 72)). For the lengthening in भवान् &c, see (VI. 4. 10), (VI. 4. 14): the च् is elided in प्राङ् by (VIII. 2. 23), and न् becomes ङ् by (VIII. 2. 62): and त् in स्रत् by (VIII. 2. 72). \n\nWhy do we say 'with the exception of a root' when by the mere fact of including one root अच् all other roots would have been excluded from the scope of this _sutra_? The specific mention of अधातोः shows that the prohibition applies to original roots, and not to those roots which are derived from nouns. Thus गोमन्तमिच्छति = गोमत्यति formed by क्यच् ॥ Here गोमत्य is a derivative root, in its primitive state it was a noun. The prohibition of अधातोः will not apply to this root and नुम् will be added. Thus गोमत्य + क्विप् = गोमत्य् + ० (the अ is dropped by (VI. 4. 48) = गोमत् + ० (the य् is elided by (VI. 4. 50)). Now is added नुम् and we have गोमान् ॥",

Observe कुण्डे, पीठे ॥ The phrase \"before an affix beginning with a vowel\" is employed here for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ like (VII. 1. 75). Here we could have dispensed with it: for before affixes beginning with a consonant नुम्, would be elided by (VIII. 2. 7). The only object that it serves here is that we can form हे त्रपो ! or हे त्रपु ! in the Vocative singular. For had we त्रपुन् + स् in the vocative, the form would have been हे त्रपुन् like हे राजन्, for न् would not be elided here, see (VIII. 2. 8).\n\nIf it be objected that by the _sutra_ न लुमताङ्गस्य (I. 1. 63) when the affix स् is elided in the Vocative, it will leave no trace behind, and there being no affix at all, नुम् will not be added in the Vocative. We reply: that this very employment of the word अच् in this _sutra_ indicates (_jnapaka_) that the rule prohibiting the effect of an affix (I. 1. 63) does not apply here. Therefore, though the affix is elided, it produces its effect in spite of (I. 1. 63), and we have the _guna_ of the vowel in the Vocative, as हे त्रपो by (VII. 3. 108).\n\nWhy have we used the word विभक्तौ 'when a case-affix follows'? Observe तुम्बुरवं चूर्णम्, where the _Taddhita_ affix अञ् is added to तुम्बुरु by (IV. 3. 139).\n\n_Karika_: - The employment of the words इकः अचि in the _sutra_ shows that नुम् will not come when the affix begins with a consonant, as त्रपुभ्यां, त्रपुभिः ॥ An objector says, the employment of अचि in the _sutra_ is useless for नुम् may be added even before an affix beginning with a consonant, for having added it, it will be elided by न लोपः प्रातिपदिकान्तस्य (VIII. 2. 7). We reply, yes it can be so done, but how will you then manage the accent? For in पञ्चत्रपुभ्यां, पञ्चत्रपुभिः, the accent is regulated by the rule (VI. 2. 29) which says that in a _Dvigu_ compound, the first member preserves its original accent if the second member ends in an इक् vowel. But if there was a नुम्, then the second member would not end in इक् but in न् : and the elision of this न् by (VII. 2. 7) is _asiddha_ for the purposes of accent. To this the objector answers, that even where न् is not elided the accent is governed by (VI. 2. 29), namely the accent of पञ्चत्रपुणे or पञ्चत्रपुण : is by (VI. 2. 29), why should it not be so when न् is elided. So the objection about accent has no strength.\n\nWell if नुम् be added even before consonant-affix, then there will arise this anomaly: अतिरि + भ्यां = अतिरिन् + भ्यां (by adding नुम्). Here rule (VII. 2. 85) cannot apply: because न् intervenes between रि and भ्यां, therefore इ of रि is not changed to आ, and therefore we cannot get the proper from अतिराभ्यां ॥ Moreover in प्रियत्रि + भ्यां, the त्रि cannot be changed to तिसृ if there be नुम्, and so we cannot get the form प्रियतिसृभ्यां ब्राह्मणकुलानि ॥\n\nTo this it is answered, the change of इ into आ in the case of रि, and the substitution of तिसृ for त्रि will take place even when the नुम् intervenes, on the maxim विभक्तिविधानदशायां यदानन्तर्ये तत् तत्राश्रीयते न त्वादेशविधानदशायाम् ॥ And this is done in this way : अतिरि + भ्यां, and प्रियत्रि + भ्यां, here नुम् is superseded by the subsequent rule requiring आ and तिसृ respectively.\n\nIf this be so, then the employment of अच् in the _sutra_ is for the sake of the supersession of नुम् by नुट् (VII. 1. 54). Thus नुट् has unrestricted scope in अग्नीनां, वायूनां, and नुम् has unrestricted scope in त्रपुणे and जतुने ॥ But in त्रपूणाम् and जतूनाम्, both नुट् and नुम् present themselves. Here however नुम् is superseded by नुट् by _purva_-_vipratishedha_ and so there is lengthening of the vowel by (VI. 4. 3). This supersession is indicated by the employment of अच्, for नुट् and नुम् being both _anitya_ and of equal force, had there been no अच्, नुम् would have come and not नुट् ॥\n\nBut this is also not valid, for नुट् would have to be added, even if there had been no अच् in the _sutra_.\n\nThe employment of अच् is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_ (VII. 1. 75). The only object that अच् serves in this _sutra_, is in forming the vocative हे त्रपो as shown above.",
    "71074": "As in the Masculine there is no shortening, nor the addition of युम्, so here also. As ग्रामणी is the equivalent, uniform masculine of the neuter form ग्रामणि, we have either Instrumental ग्रामणिना or ग्रामण्या ब्राह्मणकुलेन, the Instrumental Singular of ग्रामणि noun Similarly Dative ग्रामणिने or ग्रामण्ये ब्राह्मणकुलाय; Ablative ग्रामणिनो or ग्रामण्यो ब्राह्मणकुलात्, Genitive Singular ग्रामणिनो or ग्रामण्यो ब्राह्मणकुलस्य, Genitive Dual ग्रामणिनोर्ब्राह्मणकुलयोः or ग्रामण्योः; Genitive Plural ग्रामणीनां or ग्रामण्यां ब्राह्मणकुलानां ॥ Locative ग्रामणिनि or ग्रामण्यां ब्राह्मणकुले ॥ Similarly : Instrumental शुचिना (same form in masculine, and neuter), Dative शुचये or शुचिने; Ablative and Genitive शुचेः or शुचिनः Genitive Dual शुच्योः or शुचिनोः Locative शुचौ or शुचिनि ॥\n\nWhy do we say after the 3rd case and the rest? Observe ग्रामणिनी ब्राह्मणकुले, and शुचिनी Nominative dual. Why do we say having an appropriate masculine of the same form and meaning? Observe त्रपुण, जतुन ॥ Why have we only one form पीलुने फलाय, when पीलुर्वृक्षः and पीलुफलं show that पीलु has a masculine form also. The word पीलु is masculine when it applies to 'trees', and पीलु is neuter when it refers to 'fruits'; so this word पीलु cannot be said to be भाषितपुंस्कः, the masculine पीलु not having the same meaning as the neuter पीलु ॥ See (VI. 3. 34).\n\nWhy do we say \"ending in a vowel except अ\"? Observe कीलालपा ब्राह्मणः and कीलालपं ब्राह्मणकुलं; the Instrumental &c of कीलालपा will not be the Instrumental &c of कीलालपं ॥ The latter will have only one form कीलालपेन ब्राह्मणकुलेन ॥ &c.\n\nBefore case affixes beginning with a consonant we have one form only, as ग्रामणीभ्यां ब्राह्मणकुलाभ्याम् ॥",

The stem getting the designation भ, we elide the अ (VI. 4. 134), the _udatta_ अ being thus elided, the case-ending, which was _anudatta_ before, now becomes _udatta_ (VI. 1. 161). The stems ending with '_asthi_ &c' and though not neuter, are governed by this rule. As प्रियास्थ्ना ब्राह्मणेन, प्रियदध्ना ॥ Why 'before the affixes of the Instrumental and the rest?'

This is equal to तुद् + अ + अत् + ई = तुदती the अ + अ becoming अ by the rule of पररूप _ekadesa_ (VI. 1. 97). This _ekadesa_ operation being _antaranga_, now there is no शतृ affix coming after a stem ending in अ, and therefore this _sutra_ will not apply. If you say the _ekadesa_ will be considered as the final of तुद् by (VI. 1. 85), we reply, that the _antachvadbhava_ of that _sutra_ will not apply when simultaneous operations are to be performed, for अ cannot be said at one and the same time as the final of तुद् and the beginning of अन् (शतृ). If you say the maxim सांप्रतिकाभावे भूतपूर्व गतिः (when a word cannot denote something which actually is what is expressed by the word, it must be understood to denote something which formerly was what is expressed by it), will apply here, and that तुद् will be considered to end in अ because it formerly did end in the affix अ of श; we reply that then the present rule should apply to forms like अदती घ्नती &c. For here also we have अद् + शप् लोप + शतृ + ङीप्; and अद् should be considered to end in अ, because it had the affix शप् after it, though it was afterwards elided. The maxim quoted, therefore, proves too much.\n\nTo solve these objections, some say, that the word शतृ in this _sutra_ means 'a portion of the affix शतृ, such as त्' and the _sutra_ means 'after a stem ending in अ, to the portion त् of the affix शतृ there is added नुम्.' Others say, the word आत् in the _sutra_ qualifies शी and नदी and not शतृ; and the _sutra_ means \"नुम् is added to a stem ending in शतृ, when शी or नदी affixes follow after a stem ending in अ.\" Therefore in तुदती the affix ई is considered to come after the अ of तुद, the intervening त् not debarring it.\n\nWhy do we say \"after अ\"? Observe कुर्वती and सुन्वती, no optional नुम् is added here. Why do we say \"शी and नदी following\"? Observe तुदताम् and नुदताम्",

Thus we have अनड्वान् Nominative Singular; and अनड्वय् in the Vocative Singular. The augments आम् and अम् (VII. 1. 98), (VII. 1. 99), do not supersede नुम्, nor are they superseded by नुम् ॥\n\nIn this _sutra_, some read the _anuvritti_ of आत् from (VII.

Otherwise we have हे उशन ! Thus it has three forms in the Vocative Singular : as हे उशनस्, हे उशनन्, and हे उशन ! ॥\n\n_Karika_:- In the vocative, the word उशनस् has three forms, (1) ending in स् when अनङ् is not added, (2) ending in न्, when न् is not elided, (3) ending in अ when  न् is elided. This is the opinion of the _Acharya_ _Madhyandini_. So also according to the _Acharya_ _Vaiyaghrapadya_, (the best of the _Vyaghrapadas_), there is _Guna_ in the Neuter of the stems ending in इक् vowels; as हे त्रपो ॥\n\nThe त् in ऋत् is for the sake of distinctness.",

The accent in the strong cases is also that of the तृच् affix, i.e. acute on the final. The word क्रोष्टु is formed by the affix तुन् (_Unadi_ सितनिगमि &c, 1. 69).",
    "71096": "This _sutra_ is commenced for the sake of cases other than strong ones. In strong cases, whether of masculine or feminine, the former _sutra_ applies; but in the feminine, in other cases also there is _trich_-treatment. Thus क्रोष्ट्री꣡, क्रोष्ट्री꣡भ्याम्, क्रोष्ट्रीभिः ॥ Some read the word क्रोष्टु in the _Gauradi_ class (IV. 1. 41), and they treat it is a तृच् ending word before the feminine affix ङीष्, as क्रोष्ट्रा ॥ According to them, in forming the _Taddhitartha_ compounds like पञ्चभिः क्रोष्ट्रीभिः क्रीतैः = पञ्चक्रोष्टृभी रथैः, we could not get the form पञ्चक्रोष्टृभिः, because when the affix ठक् is elided by (V. 1. 28), the feminine is also elided by (I. 2. 49), and the ङीष् being thus _luk_-elided, there would be no तृज्वद्भाव, because the affix leaves no trace behind (I. 1. 63). To get out of the difficulty, we can only say, that the form is so, in spite of the apparent inconsistency.\n\nThose who do not read क्रोष्टु in the _Gauradi_ class, they explain this _sutra_ by saying that the word स्त्रियां indicates the sense, namely, क्रोष्टु is treated like a तृच् word, when it denotes a female, wherever it may occur.\n\nAnd because क्रोष्टु is treated as if it was क्रोष्टृ, the feminine will be formed by the affix ङीप् by (IV. 1. 5), and the form क्रोष्ट्री꣡ will be end-acute by (VI. 1. 174). So that whether क्रोष्ट्री be formed by ङीष् under _Gauradi_ class, or by ङीप् under (IV. 1. 5), the accent remains the same: while under this second view, we have not to face any such difficulty as in the first.",

Therefore when ॠ 'to go' is preceded by सम्, the rule will not apply, for म् is not part of the root: as समीर्णम् by (VII. 1. 100).\n\nVart:- The _Guna_ and _Vriddhi_ do take place in supersession of इर् and उर् substitution.

If the _antaranga_ _guna_ is superseded by this _vriddhi_, why is not the _antaranga_ उवङ् also superseded in न्यनुवीत्, न्यधुषीत् ? The _Vriddhi_ does not take place, as these roots belong to कुटादि class, after which this affix is ङित् (I. 2. 1). The _Vriddhi_ being thus superseded, we have उवङ् substitution. Why do we say in the _Parasmaipada_? Observe अच्योष्ठ, अप्लोष्ट ॥",

Observe मा भवानशीत्, मा भवानटीत् ॥ The word अन्त means here 'proximity', as in the sentence उदकान्तं गतः = उदकसमीपं गतः ॥ The अ must be in the proximity of the र and ल ॥ Therefore the rule does not apply to अवभ्रीत्, अश्वल्लीत्, for though र and ल are here final of the stem, yet are not in the proximity of अ ॥",
    "72003": "As अवादीत्, अव्राजीत् ॥ This debars the option in the case of these two roots, which would have otherwise obtained by (VII. 2. 7). So also of stems ending in consonants: as अपाक्षीत्, अभैत्सीत्, अच्छैत्सीत्, अरौत्सीत् ॥ By the splitting up of the _sutra_ (_yoga_-_vibhaga_) these forms could be evolved without using the word हलन्त in the _sutra_. Thus (1) वदिव्रज्योः \"In the room of the अ of वद and व्रज् there is _Vriddhi_\", (2) अचः \"In the room of the vowel of the stem there is _Vriddhi_\". The word \"stem\" is understood throughout these chapters. If the vowel be at the end of the stem, there would be _Vriddhi_ by (VII. 2. I), and if in the middle of the stem, then the verb ends with a consonant, and still there will be _Vriddhi_ by our rule. The use of the word हलन्त in the _sutra_ indicates that the rule applies when more than one consonant even is at the end : as अराङ्क्षीत्, अभाङ्क्षीत् ॥\n\nHad the word हलन्तस्य not been used in the _sutra_, then the following maxim would have applied \"येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्\" ॥ The rule would have applied where only one consonant intervened between the vowel and the affix, but not when more than one consonant intervened. But it is intended that the rule should apply to such cases also.\n\nThe form उदवोढाम् is thus evolved. To the root वह् we add सिच् in the second Person singular. Thus वह् + स्ताम् ॥ Now there appears the _Vriddhi_ rule on the one side; and the rule requiring the change of ह to ढ (VIII. 2. 31) the rule requiring the elision of स् (VIII. 2. 26), the rule requiring the change of त into ध (VIII. 2. 40), then the rule requiring the change of घ into ढ, and then the elision of one ढ (VIII. 3. 13) on the other. What rule is to be applied first-the _Vriddhi_ or the other rules? The _Vriddhi_ rule is to be applied first, because the other rules are considered as _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1): and after that we apply the other rules : and afterwards on account of the elision of ढ, we change the _Vriddhi_ आ into ओ (VI. 3. 112). The equation will be something like this:- वह् + स्ताम् = वाह् + स्ताम् (VII. 2. 3) = वाढ् + स्ताम्  (VIII. 2. 31) = वाढ् + ताम् (VIII. 2. 26) = वाढ् + धाम् (VIII. 2. 80) = वाह् + ढाम् (VIII. 4. 41) = वा + ढाम् (VIII. 3. 13) = वोढाम् (VI. 3. 112). This with the _upasarga_ उत् and the augment अ becomes उदवोढाम् ॥ Similar is the evolution of उदवोढम् with स्तम् ॥ Once the अ has been _Vriddhied_ into आ, there is no _Vriddhi_ of ओ ॥ Had we not first _Vriddhied_ the वह् into वाह्, but applied the _vriddhi_ rule last, then there would have been _vriddhi_ of ओ, as वौढाम् which is wrong. In fact where there has not taken place _vriddhi_ first, there ओ is _vriddhied_, as = सोढामित्रस्यापत्यं = सौढामित्रिः ॥",

No, though _Guna_ is _antaranga_, it is superseded by the express _Vriddhi_.",
    "72005": "Thus ग्रह, 'to catch' अग्रहीत्, स्यम्, 'to sound' अस्यमीत्, व्यय, 'to expend' अव्ययीत्, टुवम्, 'to vomit' अवमीत्, क्षण 'to hurt' अक्षणीत्, श्वस् 'to breathe' अश्वसीत्, जागृ 'to be awake' अजागरीत्, णि, ऊन (_churidi_) 'to lose' ऊनयीत्, ईल् 'to send' ईलयीत्, श्वि, अश्वयीत् ॥ एदिताम्, रगे 'to cover' अरगीत्, कखे, अकखीत् ॥  \n\nह्मयन्तक्षणश्वसामेदितां च अतो हलादेर्लघोरिति विकल्पे प्राप्ते प्रतिषेधः ॥ जागृणिश्वीनां तु सिचि वृद्धिः प्राप्ता, सा च नेटीति न प्रतिषिध्यते, न वान्तरङ्गत्वादत्र पूर्वे गुणो भवति सिचि वृद्धेरनवकाशत्वात् ॥ यदि पूर्वं गुणः स्यादिहणिश्विग्रहणमनर्थकं स्यात् ॥ गुणायादेशयोः कृतयोर्यकारान्तत्वादेव प्रतिषेधस्य सिद्धत्वात् ॥ तस्मादिदमेव णिश्विग्रहणं ज्ञापकं न सिच्यन्तरङ्गमस्तीति ॥ अथ जागृग्रहणं किमर्थम् ॥ जाग्रोविचिण्णल्ङित्सुं इति जागर्तेर्गुणो वृद्धेरपवादो विधीयते ॥ स यथा अचो ज्णितीति वृद्धिं बाधते, तथा सिचि वृद्धिमपि बाधिष्यते ॥ नैतदस्ति ॥ कृते गुणऽतोल्रान्तस्येति या  वृद्धिः प्राप्नोति सा प्रतिपिध्यते, ॥ अथ गुणविधानसामर्थ्यादुत्तरकालभाविन्यपि वृद्धिर्बाध्यते, ॥ यथा जागरयतीत्यत्रात उपधाया इत्यपि वृद्धिर्न भवति, तथा चिण्णलोः प्रतिषेधोर्थवान्भवति इति शक्यमिह जागृग्रहणमकर्त्तुम् ॥ तस्तु क्रियते विस्पष्टार्थम् ॥\n\nIn the case of roots ऊन and ईल in the above examples, the चङ् is prohibited by (III. 1. 51). This is an exception to (VII. 1. 7) : so far as stems in ह्, य् and म् are concerned. There is no option allowed here. In the case of जागृ, णि roots, and श्वि, the _Vriddhi_ would have taken place by (VII. I. 1) and (VII. I. 4), could not have debarred _Vriddhi_, hence the special mention of these roots.\n\nNor can it be said, in the case of these roots, that \"they will take first _guna_, on account of its being an _Antaranga_ operation\", because, then the rule of _Vriddhi_ ordained by (VII. I. I) will find no scope. Moreover, if the _guna_ took place first and then _Vriddhi_, the mention of णि-roots and श्वि in the _sutra_ would be redundant. For in ऊनयीत् and अश्वयीत्, having gunated the roots ऊनि and श्वि to ऊने and श्वे, and then substituting अय् (which is also _antaranga_ ) for ए before ईत्, we have ऊनय् + ईत्, and श्वय् + ईत् ॥ Now these are roots which end in य् and would be covered by the first portion of the present _sutra_, viz, \"_h_-_m_ _y_-_anta_\", so the especial mention of णि-roots and श्वि would be superfluous, if _guna_ was to take place first. The very mention of णि-roots and श्वि in this _sutra_, is a _jnapaka_ (indicator) of the following maxim न सिचि अन्तरङ्गमस्ति ॥\n\nWhy have we used the root जागृ in the _sutra_, when the special _sutra_ (VII. 3. 85) will cause _guna_ by superseding _Vriddhi_ in the case of जागृ? This supersession will take place on the analogy of अचोऽञ्णिति (VII. 2. 115); for as this _vriddhi_ rule (VII. 2. 115) is superseded by (VII. 3. 85), so will the present _Vriddhi_ rule (VII. 2. 1). Ans. No, this is not so. No doubt (VII. 3. 85) does supersede the _vriddhi_ rule (VII. 2. 1) and we have _guna_, as जागर् + ईत् ॥ Then comes in (VII. 2. 2), which would cause _vriddhi_, because now it is a root ending in र; this second _Vriddhi_ is prohibited by the present _sutra_. You can say, that by the very fact that the _guna_ rule (VII. 3. 85) takes effect, will prevent every future _Vriddhi_, as in जागरयति  there is no penultimate _vriddhi_ by (VII. 2. 116) [जागृ + णि = जागर् + णि (VII. 3. 85) = जागरि the rule (VII. 2. 116) does not apply after _guna_] You can, of course, say so, and there is no answer to this but by saying that the mention of जागृ is only for the sake of distinctiess.\n\nIn case the reading of जागृ in the _sutra_ be held necessary, then the operations which it undergoes, are shown below:\n\nजागृ + इस् + ईत् ॥ Now appears (1) the rule (VI. 1. 77). requiring the change of ॠ into र ॥ (2) This यणादेश is however, debarred by the rule (VII. 3. 84) which causes _guna_ of the finals of verbal stems before all _sarvadhatuka_ and _ardhadhatuka_ affixes, because this _guna_ rule is an _apavada_ to यणादेश ॥ (3) But this _guna_ in its turn is debarred by the rule (VII. 2. I) requiring the _vriddhi_. (4) But this _vriddhi_ is, however, superseded by (VII. 3. 85), which causes the _guna_ of the final of जागृ ॥ Now having gunated it, we get this form :\n\nजागर् + इस् + ईत् ॥ Now appears (VII. 2. 3) which requires _vriddhi_, because it is a root ending in a consonant. (2) But that _vriddhi_ is superseded by (VII. 2. 4) because the affix सिच् has taken the इट् augment. (3) Then appears the rule (VII. 2. 7) requiring optional _vriddhi_, (4) But that optional _vriddhi_ is superseded by the compulsory _vriddhi_ requirred by (VII. 2. 2), because it is a root ending in र ॥ (5) And this last _vriddhi_ is prohibited by the present _sutra_ (VII. 2. 5). These nine stages through which the form अजागरीत् is evolved, is abbreviated in the following mnemonic verse :- गुणो वृद्धिर्गुणो वृद्धिः प्रतिषेधो विकल्पमम् ॥ पुनर्वृद्धिर्निषेधोऽतो यण्पूर्वाः प्राप्तयो नव ॥",
    "72006": "As प्रौर्णावीत् or प्रौर्णवीत् ॥ This option applies when the सिच् is not treated as ङित् ॥ But after ऊर्णु, सिच् is optionally ङित्, (I. 2. 6): when it is ङित्, there being neither _guna_ nor _vriddhi_; we have उवङ् substitution, as प्रौर्णुवीत् (VI. 4. 77).",
    "72007": "Thus अकणीत् or अकाणीत्, अरणीत् or अराणीत् ॥ Why do we say 'of अ' ? Observe अदेवीत्, असेवीत् ॥ Besides this patent objection, there is another, not so manifest. If we had not taken अतः, the _sutra_ would have ordained _Vriddhi_ of every vowel (अचः (VII. 2. 3)), the _Vriddhi_ so ordained would be an अच् pertaining _Vriddhi_, and not an इक्-pertaining _Vriddhi_. Therefore ङित् affixes will not debar such _Vriddhi_, for the क्ङिति च (I. 1. 5), debars only इग्लक्षणा _Vriddhi_. Therefore कुटादि roots after which सिच् is ङित् (I. 2. 1), will get _Vriddhi_, which is not desired. Therefore we have only one form of न्यकुटीत्, न्यपुटीत् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'beginning with a consonant'? Observe मा भवानशीत्, मा भवानटीत् from अश् and अट् ॥ Why do we say 'prosodially short'? Observe अतक्षीत्, अरक्षीत् ॥\n\nBut why does not _vriddhi_ take place in अचकासीत् from the root चकास् (Ad. 65) ? The _vriddhi_ does not take place on the maxim येन ना व्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्; for the rule applies to short अ only when a consonant intervenes between it and the affix, and not when both consonants and vowels intervene. In चकास् not only the consonants क् and स् intervene but also the vowel आ ॥ Hence there is no _vriddhi_. Moreover, the व्यवधान can be by one letter and not by more than one letter. Therefore, applying this maxim, the word लंघाः might have been omitted from the _sutra_ without any detriment. In that case, the form अतक्षीत् from the root तक्ष (_Bhu_ 685) will be explained by saying that rule (VII. 2. 7) does not apply to it, because two consonants intervene between अ and the affix. In this view of the case, the employment of the word लघोः in the _sutra_ is for the sake of distinctness only.\n\nThe word इट् is understood in this _sutra_, so that the rule applies to सेट् aorist. The rule therefore, does not apply to _Anit_ aorist, as अपाक्षीत् ॥\n\nThe form अपिपठिषीत् the aorist of the Desiderative root, is explained by saying that the long आ of _vriddhi_ is elided by (VI. 4. 64).",
    "72008": "The वश् _pratayahara_ is rather vague. The rule really applies to _Krit_ affixes beginning with व, र (ल) म and न, and no कृत् affix begins with any other letter of वश् class. Thus ईशिता, इशितुम् non-_vas_ letters get the augment, but not ईश्वरः, (III. 2. 175) so also दीपिता, दीपितुम् but not दीप्रम् (III. 2. 167) (र्) भसिता, भसितुम् but not भस्म, (III. 2. 75).(मनिन्) यतिता, यतितुम् but not यत्नः (III. 3. 90) (नङ्) The _Vartika_ नेड् वरमनादौ कृति gives the rule in a more definite form. Of course, in the _Unadi_ _Krit_-affixes, there is diversity. There we get the affix ड, for example, which of course does not take the augment, as दम् + ड = दण्डः (_Unadi_ I. 113). Why do we say कृत् affixes? Observe रुदिव, रुदिम ॥\n\nHere by (VII. 2. 76) the _Sarvadhatuka_ affixes beginning with a वल् consonant take इट् augment after the roots रुद् &c; but this इट् will also be prohibited by the present _sutra_, if the word कृति be not read in the _sutra_. So that rule (VII. 2. 76) would find scope before those affixes वलादि only which do not begin with a वश् letter; as रुदितः ॥ In some texts of _Kasika_ the counter-example is रुरुदिम in the Perfect. This is wrong, according to _Padamanjari_ (क्रादिनियमादेव इटः सिद्धत्वात्) because इट् always comes in the Perfect except after the root कृ &c. (VII. 2. 13): so the counter-example from the Perfect Tense is not valid. This _sutra_ is an exception to (VII. 2. 35). The _Krit_-affixes beginning with वश् letters as given by _Panini_ are the following: वन् (वनिप्, क्वनिप्, ङवनिप्), वर (वरच and क्वरप्), वस् (क्वसु), रु (क्रु), लुक् (क्लुकन्), मन् (मनिन्), मर (क्मरच्) न (नङ्, मन्), नज् (नजिङ्), नु (क्नु) ॥ This list will show the truth of the above _vartika_.",

I. 15), is meant here, and not वस् 'to cover' (II. 13), which does not vocalise, as वसिता वस्त्राणाम्, but उषितः from वस 'to dwell' (VII. 2. 52).\n\n(3.) भ् - Three roots : रभ् 'to desire' (I. 1023), as, आरब्धा, यभ् coire (I. 1029), यब्धा, लभ् 'to take' (I. 1024), लब्धा ॥\n\n(4.) म् - Four roots, यम् 'to cease' (I. 1033), यन्ता; रम् 'to play' (I. 906) रन्ता, नम् 'to bow'. (I.867, 1030) नन्ता, गम्लृ 'to go' (I. 1031) गन्ता ॥\n\n(5). न् - Two roots मन् 'to think' (IV. 67), मन्ता, हन् 'to kill' (II. 2), हन्ता ॥ The _Divadi_ मन् should be taken, otherwise मनिता from मन् - मनुते (VIII. 9). \n\n(6.) ह् - Eight roots :- दिह् 'to smear' (II. 5), देग्धा; दुह् 'to milk' (II. 4), दोग्धा; मिह् 'to sprinkle' (I. 1041) मीढा, रुह् 'to grow' (I. 912) रोढा; वह् 'to carry' (I. 1053) वोढा, नह् 'to bind' (IV. 57) नद्धा; दह् 'to burn' (I. 1041) दग्धा, लिह् 'to lick' (II. 6) लेढा ॥ In other collections सह् (I. 905, IV. 20), मुह् (IV. 89), रिह (VI. 23), लुह् (?), are also enumerated; of these सह् takes इट् optionally before affixes beginning with त, so also मुह् because it belongs to the class of रधादि (VII. 2. 45) the other two are not found (?) in root-collections, hence the _Karika_ uses the words मुक्तसंशयः ॥\n\n(7.) श् - Ten roots :- दिश् 'to show' (VI. 3), दृश् 'to see' (I. 1037), दश् 'to bite' (I. 1038), मृश् 'to rub' (VI. 131), स्पृश् 'to touch' (VI. I28), रिश (VI. 126), रुश् (VI. 126) both meaning 'to hurt', विश् 'to enter'(VI. 130), लिश् 'to be small' (IV. 70, VI. 127). As वेष्टा, द्रष्टा, दंष्टा, आम्रष्टा or आमर्ष्टा, स्पर्ष्टा or स्प्रष्टा, The roots with a penultimate ॠ short, which are _anudatta_ in the _dhatupatha_, with the exception of मृज् and दृश्, take optionally the augment रम् (VI. I. 59), ॥ रष्टो, रोष्टा, क्रोष्टा, प्रवेष्टा, लेष्टा ॥\n\n(8.) ध् - Ten roots:- रुध् with अनु, 'to love'. रुध् 'to obstruct' (IV. 65) रोद्धा, राध् 'to accomplish' (IV. 71, V. 16) राद्धा; युध् 'to fight' (IV. 64) योद्धा; बन्ध् 'to bind' (1. 1022), बन्द्धा; साध् 'to accomplish' (V. 17) साद्धा; क्रुध् 'to be angry' (IV. 80) क्रोद्धा, क्षुध् 'to be hungry' (IV. 81) क्षोद्धा; शुध् 'to be pure' (IV. 82) शोद्धा, बुध् 'to be aware' (IV. 63); बोद्धा; ष्यध् 'to pierce' ( IV. 72) ष्यद्धा; सिध् 'to be accomplished' (IV. 83) सेद्धा ॥ The roots बुध् and सिध् are exhibited in the above _Karika_ with श्यण् _vikarana_ (बुद्ध्यति, सिद्ध्यति); therefore बुध् and सिध् take इट् in other _ganas_ than the Fourth; as बोधिता and सेधिता ॥ There being want of prohibition with regard to निष्ठा, we have बुधितं and सिधितं ॥\n\n(9.) ष् - roots. Ten. शिष् 'to distinguish' (VII, 14) शेष्टा; पिष् 'to pound' (VII. 15) पेष्टा, शुष् 'to become dry' (IV. 74) शोष्टा; पुष् 'to be nourished' (IV. 73), पोष्टा, त्विष् 'to shine' (I. 1050) त्वेष्टा, विष् 'to pervade, to sprinkle' (I. 729, III. 13, IX. 54) वेष्टा, श्लिष् 'to embrace' (I. 734. IV. 77) श्लेष्टा; तुष् 'to be satisfied' (IV. 75) तोष्टा, दुष् 'to be sinful' (IV. 76) दोष्टा, दोक्ष्यति, द्विष् 'to hate' (II. 3) द्वेष्टा, द्वेक्ष्यति, कृष् 'to  draw' (I. 1059, VI. 6 both _Bhuadi_ and _Tudadi_ are taken, as the _karika_ uses the two forms), आक्रष्टा and आकर्ष्टा ॥\n\n(10.) प् Thirteen roots : तप् 'to burn' (1. 1034, IV. 51) तप्ता, तप्स्यति, तिप् 'to distil' (I. 385) तेप्ता, आप् 'to obtain' (V 14, X. 295) आप्ता; वप् 'to sow' (I. 1052) वप्ता; स्वप् 'to sleep' (II. 59) स्वप्ता; लिप् 'to anoint' (VI. 139) लेप्ता; लुप् (VI. 137) 'to break', लोप्ता ॥ The roots तृप् and वृप् optionally take इट्, as they belong to रधादि class (VII. 2. 45, _Divadi_ 84 - 91). The special mention of these two roots in the _karika_, is for the sake of indicating that these roots take अम् augment; as त्रप्ता or तर्प्ता, or तर्पिता; द्रप्ता, or दर्प्ता or दर्पिता ॥ The तृप् and दृप् belonging to _Tudadi_ class, are _Udatta_ and सेट् ॥ सृप् (I. 1032) 'to creep' स्रप्ता, सर्प्ता; शप् 'to curse (1. 1049) शप्ता; छुप् 'to touch' (VI. 125) छोप्ता; क्षिप् 'to throw' (IV. 14) क्षेप्ता ॥\n\n(11.) द - Fifteen roots. अद् 'to eat' [II. I] अत्ता; हद् 'to void excrement' (I. 1026) हत्ता; स्कन्द् 'to leap' (I. 1028) स्कन्ता; भिद् 'to break' (VII. 2) भेत्ता, छिद् 'to cut' (VII. 3) छेत्ता; क्षुद् 'to pound' (VII. 6) क्षोत्ता, क्षोत्स्यति, शद् 'to perish' (I. 908, VI. 134), शत्ता, सद् 'to sink' (I. 907, VI. 133) सत्ता, स्विद् 'to sweat' (IV. 79) स्वेत्ता ॥ The root is exhibited as स्विद्ध्यति in the above _karika_, showing that the Fourth class root is to be taken, and not the _Bhuadi_ (1. 780), which is _udatta_ and takes इट् ॥ पद् 'to go' (IV. 60), पत्ता; खिद् 'to be troubled' (IV. 61, VI. 142, VII. 12) खेत्ता, तुद् 'to strike' (VI. 1) तोत्ता; नुद् 'to impel' (VI. 2) नोत्ता; विद् (IV. 62)  वेत्ता ॥ The root विद् is exhibited in the _karika_, as विद्यति and विन्त, therefore, the rule applies to दिवादि and क्र्यादि विद् ॥ The _Adadi_ (वेत्ति) and _Tudadi_ (विन्दति) विद् is सेट् as वेदिता विद्यानाम्, वेदिताधनस्य ॥\n\n(12.) च् - six roots :- पच् 'to cook' (I. 187) पक्ता, पक्ष्यति; वच् 'to speak' (II. 54) वक्ता, विच् 'to separate' (VII. 5) विवेक्ता; रिच् 'to make empty' (VII. 4) रेक्ता; सिच् 'to sprinkle' (VI. 140) सेक्ता; मुच् (VI. 136) 'to loose' मोक्ता ॥\n\n(13.) छ् - One root प्रछ् 'to ask' (VI. 120) प्रष्टा, प्रक्ष्यति ॥\n\n(14.) ज् - Fifteen roots :- रञ्ज् 'to colour' (I. 865. 1048) रङ्क्ता; निज् 'to cleanse' (II. II) निर्णेक्ता, नेक्ष्यति; भज् 'to honor' (I. 1047) भक्ता; भञ्ज् 'to break' (VII. 16) भङ्क्ता; भृञ्ज् 'to fry' (I. 181) भ्रष्टा or भर्ष्टा; त्यज् 'to quit' (I. 1035) त्यक्ता; यज् 'to sacrifice' (I. 1051) यष्टा, युज् 'to join' (IV. 68, VII. 7) योक्ता; रुज् 'to break' (VI. 123) रोक्ता; सञ्ज् 'to adhere' (I. 1036) सङ्क्ता, मञ्ज 'to be immersed' (VI. 122) मङ्क्ता; भुज् 'to bend' (VI. 124) 'to enjoy' (VII. 17). भोक्ता, स्वज् 'to embrace' (I. 1025) परि-ष्वक्ता; सृज 'to emit' 'to create' (IV. 69, VI. 121) स्रष्टा; मज् 'to cleanse' (I. 269, II. 57), मार्ष्टा, मर्जिता ॥ The root मृज् is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with a long indicatory ऊ, e-s, मृजू शुद्धौ (II. 57). It, therefore, optionally would take इट् ॥ Nor does this root take अम् augment. The inclusion of this root in the above list is, therefore, questionable. Others read विज instead of मृज ॥ The निजादि root विज is _Anit_ (III. 12) i. e. विज् 'to separate' the विज् of _Rudhadi_ takes इट् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"a monosyllabic root\"? Observe अवधीत् ॥ The root is taught as वध with a final अ (II. 4. 42) in order to prevent _vriddhi_. Why do we say \"in _upadesa_ or _Dhatupatha_\"?\n\nThe rule will not apply to roots which have become _anudatta_ during evolution i. e. when taking affixes. Therefore, we have पचिष्यति and लविष्यति with इट्, but not here, कर्ता कटान, कर्त्तुम् ॥",
    "72011": "_Karika_  \n\nवाच्य ऊर्णोर्नुवद्भावो यङ्प्रसिद्धिः प्रयोजनम् ।\nआमश्च प्रतिषेधार्थमेकाचश्चेडुपग्रहात् ॥\n\nAs श्रित्वा, श्रितः, श्रितवान् ॥ So also with roots ending in उक् vowels : as युत्वा, युतः, युतवान्; लूत्वा, लूनः, लूनवान्; वृत्वा, वृतः, वृतवान्; तीर्त्वा, तीर्णः, तीर्णवान् ॥\n\nWhy 'श्रि and उक् ending roots only'? Observe विदितः ॥ Why having an indicatory क्? Observe श्रयितृ, श्रयितुम्, श्रयितव्यम् ॥ Some read two क's in the _sutra_ and would apply it to the indicatory ग् also, as भूष्णु (III. 2. 139).\n\nThis rule applies to those roots, which have not been enumerated above. In the case of यु the _Nishtha_ will not take इट् even by (VII. 2. 49) read with (VII. 2. 15).\n\nWhen two क are read in the _sutra_, one standing for ग्; there arises a little difficulty of combination. Thus ग् coming after the _visarga_ of उकः would require that the _visarga_ be changed to उ by (VI. 1. 114). If ग् be changed to क् (VIII. 4. 55) then also, the _visarga_ required to be changed into _upadhmaniya_ by (VIII. 3. 37). If the change of ग् into क् (VIII. 4. 55) be considered _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1.), then also the _visarga_ must be changed to उ (VI. 1. 114), and the _sutra_ should be श्र्युकोकिति ॥ This, however, is not done as an anomaly allowable in _sutra_ construction. According to _Kasika_, this difficulty would not at all arise, if in the _sutra_ ग्लाजिस्थश्चक्स्नु (III. 2. 139), the स्था + आ be taken as compounded into स्था; so that that rule would apply to that स्था which ends in आ, and not to that स्था whose final is changed to ई; so that the form स्थास्नुः is evolved without anomaly: and the affix will be कित् (क्स्नु) and not गित् (ग्स्नु). The affix being कित्, the above _sandhi_ difficulty will not arise at all.\n\nThe word उपदेश is understood here also, so that the rule will apply to roots which end in उक् vowel, in their original states and not to the transformed base before the affix. Thus तॄ is a उक्-ending root, which is transformed to तीर् before the _Nishtha_ त ॥ The rule will apply to it, as तीर्णः ॥ If you object saying, that तॄ  ends in long ॠ and its Desiderative optionally takes इट् by (VII. 2. 41), and therefore, its _Nishtha_ will always take no इट् by (VII. 2. 15). we reply, that the option taught in (VII. 2. 41) applies to roots ending in long ॠ; but when the root vowel is changed to ई, it is no longer a ॠ-ending root. If you say, the rule of _sthanivad_ _bhava_ will apply: we say, that that rule is not applicable to अल् विधि, and this is an अल्विधि ॥ Therefore, the word उपदेश should be read into this _sutra_. If this be so, the rule ought to apply to जागृ, and we could not get the forms जागरितः and जागरितवान् ॥ To explain this we should also read the _anuvritti_ of एकाच् into this _sutra_. The root ऊर्णु, however is an exception and is governed by this rule, in spite of its consisting of more than one vowel. Thus प्रोर्णुतः and प्रोर्णुतवान् ॥\n\n_Karika_:- ऊर्णु is treated as if it was नु, when the affix यङ् is to be applied, आम् is to be prohibited, or इट् is to be debarred.",
    "72012": "As जिघृक्षति, जुघुक्षति, रुरूषति, लुलूषति ॥ The _anuvritti_ of श्रि is not drawn into this _sutra_, as option is allowed regarding it by (VII 2. 49). ग्रह would always get इट्, गुह् (1. 944) being ऊदित् (in the _Dhatupatha_), would have optionally taken इट् (VII. 2. 44)\n\nThe forms जिघृक्षति and जुघुक्षति are thus evolved :- ग्रह् + सम् (the affix is कित् by (I. 2. 8)) = गृह् + सन् (VI. I. 16) = गृढ् + सन् (VIII. 2. 31) = गृक् + सन् (VIII. 2. 41) = जिघृक्षति (VIII. 2. 37). So also with गुहू संवरणे, the सन् is कित् here by (I. 2. 10).",
    "72013": "Thus कृ - चकृव, चकृम; सृ, ससृव, ससृम; भृ, बभृव, बभृम; वृञ्, ववृव, ववृम; वृङ्, ववृवहे, ववृमहे; स्तु, तुष्टुव, तुष्टुम; द्रु, दुद्रुव, दुद्रम; स्रु; सुस्रुव, सुस्रुम; श्रु; शुश्रुव, शुश्रुम ॥ सिद्धे सत्यारम्भो नियमार्थः, क्रादय एव लिट्यनिटस्ततोन्ये सेट इति ॥\n\nThese roots with the exception of वृ are _Anit_ by rule (VII. 2. 10); their special mention here is for the sake of _niyama_, namely, these roots alone are _Anit_ in the Perfect, other roots are all Set in the Perfect. Thus बिभिदिव, बिभिदिम, लुलुविव, लुलुविम ॥ All _anudatta_ roots of the _Dhatupatha_ are to be understood, by this rule, to get इट् ॥ The affix थ of the Perfect gets इट् after वृञ्, as the irregular form ववर्थ in (VII. 2. 64), indicates that in the _Veda_, थ does not get इट् after वृञ्, but in the secular literature it does. By (VII. 2. 63), the थ would have got इट् after स्तु, द्रु, स्रु and श्रु; that इट् is also prohibited by the present _sutra_. As तुष्टोथ, दुद्रोथ,\nस्रुस्रोथ, शुश्रोथ ॥\n\nVart:- इट् is added when कृ takes the सुट् augment : as संचस्करिव, संचस्करिम ॥ The rule (VII. 2. 63), applies here also, as संचस्करिथ ॥",
    "72014": "As शूनः, शूनवान; ओलेजी (VI. I0), - लग्न, लग्नवान्; ओविजी (VI. 9), औद्विग्नः, उद्विग्नवान् ॥ The त is changed to न because of the indicatory ओ (VIII. 2. 45). So also दीपी (IV. 42), दीप्तः, दीप्तवान् ॥ In the _Dhatupatha_, डीङ् (IV. 27), is classed among ओदित् roots, and it indicates that the _Nishtha_ is _anit_ after it : and ओ is for न-change (VIII. 2. 45) as, उड्डीनः, उड्डीनवान् ॥ The word निष्ठायाम् governs the following _sutras_ upto (VII. 2. 35).",
    "72015": "That is, a root which is optionally Set, before other affixes, is invariably _anit_ before _Nishtha_. Thus by (VII. 2. 44), वल् consonant beginning affixes are optionally सेट् after the roots धू &c. The _Nishtha_ after धू &c, will be invariably _anit_. Thus विधूतः, विधूतवान्; गूढः, गूढवान् ॥ By (VII. 2. 56), the roots having an indicatory उ, optionally are followed by Set क्त्का ॥ The _Nishtha_ after उदित् roots will invariably be _anit_ : as वृद्धः, वृद्धवान् ॥\n\nBy the _vartika_ तानि पदि दरिद्राणामुपसंख्यानम् the roots तन्, पत and दरिद्रा take optional इट् in the Desiderative (VII. 2. 49). Though पत् is a root which thus optionally takes इट् in the Desiderative , yet its _Nishtha_ is always सेट्, for _Panini_ himself has employed the word पतित in _Sutra_ (II. 1. 24), (II. 2. 38). According to _Padamanjari_ this rule of यस्य विभाषा  is _anitya_ and not of universal application. Because had this rule been of universal application then the root कृत which is optionally _anit_ by (VII. 2. 57), would universally _anit_ by the present _sutra_ : and there would be no necessity of reading it with a long ई in the _Dhatupatha_, as कृती छेदने (VI. 141) to make its _nishtha_ _anit_ under (VII. 2. 14).",
    "72016": "As ञिमिदा – मिम्नः, मिन्नवान्; ञिक्ष्विदा – क्ष्विण्णः – क्ष्विण्णवान्; ञिष्विदा – स्विम्नः, स्विन्नवान् ॥ The च implies that other roots not enumerated are to be also included, as आश्वस्तः, वान्तः ॥\n\nThis and the _sutra_ following it could have been made into one, as आदितश्च विभाषा भावादिकर्मणोः ॥ The separate making of two _sutras_ indicates that the rule of यस्य विभाषा (VII. 2. 15), applies with the restrictions and limitations of the rule ordaining 'option', i.e., the prohibition of इट् augment, with regard to the participial-affixes is limited by the same conditions, which apply to the optional employment of इट् before other affixes in the विभाषा rules (यदुपाधेर्विभाषा, तदुपाधेः प्रतिषेधः) ॥ Thus (VII. 2. 68) ordains इट् optionally to the affix वसु after the roots गम्, हन्, विद् and विश् ॥ The root विद् there is the _Tudadi_ root meaning 'to acquire'. The rule यस्य विभाषा will apply to this विद् with this meaning : and not to विद् meaning 'to know', the Past Participles of which are विदितः, विदितवान् ॥",
    "72017": "Thus मिन्नमनेन or मेदितमनेन, प्रमिन्नः, प्रमेदितः ॥ The _Saunagas_ optionally make the _Nishtha_ set after the root शक्, when the affix has a Passive significance even, as शकितो घटः कर्त्तुम् or शक्तोः घटः कर्त्तुम् ॥ Not so, when the affix has Impersonal force, as शक्तमनेन् ॥ The root अस् 'to throw' (अस्यति), is followed by सेट् _Nishtha_, when the sense is Impersonal: as असितमनेन; but not when the beginning of action is meant, as अस्तः काण्डः ॥",
    "72018": "When the words have not the above sense, we have 1. क्षुभितं 'disturbed or agitated'. The phrase क्षुब्धो गिरिः or नदी is a metaphorical use of the word. 2. स्वनितः as स्वनितो मृदङ्गः, स्वनितं मनसा ॥ 3. ध्वनितो मृदङ्गः or ध्वनितं मनसा ॥ 4. लगितं, 5. म्लेच्छितं, (= अपभाषितं) 6. विरोभितं from रेभृ 'to sound', or विरिभितं from रिभि ॥ 7. फाणितं ॥  फाण्ट is a decoction, prepared without much trouble, by simply slightly heating the substance with some water, without powdering or pasting it.

This watery extract, to be drunk in the morning, is so called. फाण्ट is a similar hot preparation, but for immediate use, when the drugs are put in boiling water and the decoction after purification is ready for use as a drink. 8. वाहितं from वाह 'to strive'.",
    "72019": "As धृष्टः, विशस्तः ॥ The root धृष् is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ as ञिधृषा 'to be impudent' (V. 2 2), and as it has an indicatory आ, its past participle would be अनिट् by (VII. 2. 16). शस् is शसु in the _Dhatupatha_ (1.763), and as it has an indicatory उ by (VII. 2. 56). read with (VII. 2. 15), its _Nishtha_ is also _Anit_. The special mention of these roots here, is for the sake of making a _niyama_ rule; namely, अनिट् only then when meaning 'impudent', and सेट् in other senses : as धर्षितः, विशसितः \"धृष् never forms past participle with the force of भाव (Impersonal action) or आदिकर्म (beginning of action), and therefore (VII. 2. 17) cannot apply to it\" - _This is _Kasika_. According to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshit_ who quotes _Haradatta_ and _Madhava_, धृष् forms participles in those senses, when option is allowed, as, धृष्टं or धर्षितं, प्रधृष्टः or प्रधर्षितः not meaning 'impudent'.",
    "72020": "It is derived from दृंह् with क्त affix. In other senses, the forms are दृंहितम् or दृहितम् ॥ There are two roots one दृह् (1.769) without nasal, and the other दृंह् (1.770) with the nasal. दृढ can be derived from any one of these by eliding ह, and the nasal, and changing त to ढ, and not adding the augment इट् ॥\n\nThe difference between स्थूल and बल is that a man may be stout or स्थूल without being strong (बलवान्) and vice versa. The word बल in the _sutra_ is equal to बलवत्; in fact, the word बल is formed by अच् affix. The irregularity in the formation of दृढ consists in the absence of इट् and the elision of ह् (and of न्, if the root दृंह be taken) : and the change of त into ढ ॥ This irregular elision of ह is for the sake of preventing the application of the rule पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् (VIII. 2. 1). The form could have been obtained in the regular way by the elision of ढ, thus : दृह् + त = दृढ् + त (VIII. 2. 31) = दृढ् + ध = दृढ् + ढ = दृ + ढ (VIII. 3. 13) = दृढ ॥ But then when ढ is elided, the rule पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् will apply, and the forms द्रढिमा, द्रढीयान्, द्रढयति could not be obtained. For ॠ is changed to र by (VI. 4. 161) only when it is _laghu_ or light, but ढ -_lopa_ being considered _asiddha_, the ॠ would be heavy as standing before a conjunct consonant. So also the form परिदृढय्याऽगतः could not be obtained: for the णि would not be changed to अय् before ल्यप् when the ॠ is not light or _laghu_ (VI. 4. 56). So also, परिदृढस्यापत्यं = परिदृढी (the daughter of _Paridrdha_) could not be formed. For ॠ being considered _guru_ or heavy, the affix ष्यङ् would have come in the feminine (IV. 1. 78).",
    "72021": "This is formed, like दृढ, from वृह् or वृंह् ॥ When not having the sense of 'Lord', we have परिवृहितम् and परिवृंहितम् ॥\n\nThe ह is elided first as an anomaly. By so doing we can get the forms like परिव्रढयति, परिव्रढय्यगतः; पारिवृढीकन्या ॥ The form परिव्रढय्य is formed by ल्यप् instead of _ktva_ ॥ Though the full noun is परिवृढ and णिच् is added to such a noun, yet for the purposes of _ktva_ it is considered as a compound verb, having परि as _upasarga_. In fact, णिच् is added to वृढ, and the root becomes व्रढि, and then _ktva_ is added to this root, and then there is compounding of परि with this word ending in _ktva_, and then by the regular process the _ktva_ is replaced by ल्यप् ॥ The general rule is that Derivative roots formed from nouns, like परिवृढ, उत्मनस्, सुमनस् &c which have an _upasarga_ as one of their formative elements, are treated as if they were compound verbs having those _upasargas_. The result of this is, that though the full noun is सुमनस्, yet in the derivative verb, सु will be treated as an _upasarga_, as in ordinary compound verbs. Thus the augment अ in the Imperfect is added after सु and not before it, as स्वमनायत, उदमनायत ॥ The rule is उपसर्गसमानाकारं पूर्वपदं धातुसंज्ञाप्रयोजके प्रत्यये चिकीर्षिते पृथक् क्रियते ॥ The Participial form of these words is therefore with ल्यप् and not क्त्वा, as सुमनाय्य and उन्मनाय्य ॥ The only exception to this rule is the noun संग्राम, in which the _upasarga_ सम् is not considered as a separate member in the Derivative verb. This being the general rule, in परिव्रढयति the portion परि is treated as an _upasarga_, and व्रढयति as the verb, and its accent is governed by तिङ्ङ तिङ् (VIII. I. 28) i. e. it becomes altogether unaccented and परि retains its accent. So also परिव्रढय्य, where is परि is compounded with the Participial form व्रढित्वा, and then त्वा is changed to ल्यप् by (VII. 1. 37).",

The prohibition of विशब्दन in the _sutra_, indicates by _jnapaka_ that the णिच् added to the root in the _Churadi_ class in the sense of विशब्दन is _anitya_. So the following construction becomes valid:- as महीपालवचः श्रुत्वा जुघुषुः पुष्पमाणवाः \"expressed their opinions in words\".\n\nIn short the णिच् is optionally added to the घुषिर् of the _Churadi_ class.\n\nSome say the _Churadi_ णिच् is _anitya_ generally and not only after घुषिर् (अनित्य ण्यन्ताश्चुरादयः) ॥ This is inferred from the mention of the root चिति स्मृत्याम् (X. 2) in this class. The indicatory इ in चिति shows that the augment इट् will be added to the root, which will thus become चिन्त and this न will be retained throughout and never dropped. (VII. I. 48). Now had the णिच् been _nitya_, then the root ought to have been taught as चिन्त स्मृत्याम्, because no rule would have caused the elision of the न् of चिन्त when णिच् was added. The enunciation of the root as चिति, therefore, indicates that the _churadi_ णिच् is _anitya_, and thus we get the forms like, चिन्तितः, चिन्त्यात्, चिन्त्यते, चिन्तति, चिन्तेत् &c.",

By (VII. 2. 49) ज्ञप् optionally is सेट् and, therefore, by (VII. 2. 15), its Participle would have been always अनिट्, hence, this _sutra_ makes an option.",

The word लोम means the hair of the body as well as of the head : as in the sentence लोमनखं स्पृष्ट्वा शौचं कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The sense of हृष् in connection with लोम or will be that of bristling up, horipillation. Why do we say \"in connection with लोम?\" Observe हृष्टो (_bhuadi_) देवदत्तः 'the deceived _Devadatta_' and ह्रषितो (_Divadi_) देवदत्तः 'the delighted _Devadatta_'.\n\nVart:- The option is allowed also in the senses of 'astonished' and 'beaten back', as ह्रष्टो or हृषितो देवदत्तः 'the astonished _Devadatta_'. हृष्टाः or हृषिता दन्ताः 'the bent or destroyed teeth'.",

This example is given when the sense is that of 'fear'; when the word means 'honor', then the participle must govern the genitive case, as required by (III. 2. 188).\n\nVart:- Before क्तिन् affix, चाय् is always changed to चि, as अपचितिः 'Loss, destruction, showing reverence'. The affix क्तिन् is added to चाय्, by considering it as belonging to the class of आप् &c. See (III. 3. 94) _Vartika_. Otherwise it would take the affix अ by (III. 3. 103).",

Similarly (5) चत्ता (= चतिता) वर्षेण विद्युत् from चते याचने ॥ (6) उत्तानाया हृदयं यद् विकस्तम् (= विकसितम्) The forms, 7 8, and 9 are from the roots शसु हिंसायाम् and शंसु स्तुतौ, and शासु अनुशिष्टौ with the affix तृच् and no augment; as एकस्त्वष्टुरश्वस्याविशस्ता (= विशसिता), उत शंस्ता सुविप्रः (= शंसिता), प्रशास्ता (= प्रशासितम्) ॥ The forms 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 are from the roots तृ and वॄ (वृङ् and वृङ्), with the affix तृच्, and the augment उट् and ऊट् ॥ As तरुतारं or तरूतारं रथानाम्  (= तरितारम् or तरीतारम्), वरुतारम् or वरूतारम् रथानाम् (= वरितारम् or वरीतारम्); वरूत्रीष्टा देवीर्विश्वदेव्यावती ॥ वरूत्रीः is exhibited in this form of Nominative Plural of the feminine वरूत्री merely for the sake of showing one form in which it is found : another form is अहोरात्राणि वैवरूत्रयः ॥ Here the plural is formed irregularly, by taking the word as वरूत्रि ॥ The feminine form could have been easily obtained from वरूतृ, by adding ङीप्, the special mention is explanatory.

    "72035": "Thus लविता, लवितुम्, लवितव्यम्, पविता, पवितुम्, पवितव्यम् ॥ Why '_ardhadhatuka_'? Observe आस्ते, वस्ते ॥ The _niyama_ rule of (VII. 2. 76) ordaining इट् augment to _sarvadhatuka_ affixes of _Rudadi_ verbs, would prevent इट् augment before _sarvadhatuka_ affixes when coming after other roots. The employment of _ardhadhatuka_ here can be dispensed with. Why before affixes beginning with a वल्-consonant? Observe लव्यम्, पव्यम्, लवनीयम्, पवनीयम् ॥ Though the _anuvritti_ of इट् was understood here, its repetition is for the sake of preventing the prohibition of the foregoing _sutras_ like (VII. 2. 8).",
    "72036": "The roots स्नु and क्रम् are _udatta_, and will get इट् augment naturally, the _sutra_ makes a restriction or _niyama_. The restriction is that when the roots themselves occasion _atmanepada_ affixes, then they do not take इट्, otherwise they will.\n\nWhen do roots give occasion to _Atmanepada_ affixes? The roots occasion _atmanepada_ affixes when employed in the Impersonal, Passive, and Intensive senses. _Sutras_ (I. 3. 38) – (I. 3. 43), teach us when क्रम takes _Atmanepada_ affixes. Thus प्रस्नविता, प्रस्नवितुम्, प्रस्नवितव्यम्, प्रक्रमिता, प्रक्रमितुम्, प्रक्रमितव्यम् ॥ Why do we say 'when not the occasion of getting the _Atmanepada_ affixes'? Observe, प्रस्नोषीष्ट, प्रक्रंसीष्ट, प्रस्नोष्यते, प्रक्रंस्यते, प्रस्नुषिष्यते, प्रचिक्रंसिष्यते ॥ In all these examples स्नु and क्रम् have become the causes of taking the _Atmanepada_ affixes. The Desiderative is also _Atmanepadi_ because of (I. 3. 62).\n\nWhy have we used the word निमित्त in the _sutra_? Would it not have been simpler to say स्नुक्रमोरमात्मनपदे ? This form of _sutra_ would have indicated that whenever an _atmanepada_ affix followed, then there would be no इट् augment. Now the rule is that all words exhibited in the Locative case in this Grammar, have the force of परसप्तमी, i. e. when that word follows. Therefore आत्मनेपदे would mean when an _atmanepada_ affix followed. If then this \"_atmanepada_\" be taken as qualifying स्नु and क्रम्, then it must follow immediately after those roots, as in प्रस्नोषीष्ट and प्रक्रंसीष्ट; but we would not get the forms प्रस्नोष्यते and प्रक्रंस्यत, because स्य intervenes between the _atmanepada_ and the affix. On the other hand if \"_atmanepada_\" be taken to qualify the word \"_ardhadhatuka_ affix\" understood, viz, if the _sutra_ meant स्नुक्रमिभ्यां परस्यार्धधातुकस्यात्मनेपदेऽनन्तरे then the forms प्रस्नोष्यते and प्रक्रंस्यते would be valid, but we should not get the forms प्रस्नोषीष्ट and प्रक्रंसीष्ट, because the augment सीयुट् is a portion of the _atmanepada_ affix, and there is no _ardhadhatuka_ affix here. If the _sutra_ be taken to have both the above senses, then we could not get the form प्रचिक्रंसिष्यते in the Desiderative, because here the _atmanepada_ does not follow immediately after the _sarvadhatuka_ affix that follows क्रम् ॥ Therefore, the word निमित्त should be taken. For by so doing, there takes place prohibition with regard to सीयुट् &c, and also with regard to that after which comes the _atmanepada_, as the स्य in प्रचिक्रंसिष्यते, and also with regard to that which precedes the latter, as the सन् affix in the above. In प्रस्नवित्रीयते (प्रस्नवितेवाचरति), the root स्नु has not occasioned the _atmanepada_ affix, but the affix क्यङ्, hence the prohibition of this _sutra_ does not apply.\n\nVart:- Prohibition of इट् augment should be stated with regard to क्रम् when an _Krit_-affix, with active force, follows not in the _atmanepada_, though in the Active voice such क्रम् was subject of _Atmanepada_. When क्रम् takes no _upasargas_, we have according to one view two forms क्रन्ता and क्रमिता (I. 3. 43) because the _atmanepada_ here is optional. According to the other view there will be only one form, as क्रमिता  ॥ But with  प्र and उप् we have प्रक्रन्ता and उपक्रन्ता ॥ Why do we say 'the _Krit_-affix should have an active force'? Observe प्रक्रमितव्यम्, उपक्रमितव्यम् ॥ Why do we say \"when it was subject of _Atmanepada_\"? Observe निष्क्रमिता ॥ Here there is इट् augment ; for by (I. 3. 42), क्रम् is subject of _atmanepada_, when the _upasargas_ प्र and उप precede, but not otherwise.\n\nWith regard to स्नु, it will take no इट् in the Desiderative, and before a कित् affix, by virtue of (VII. 2. 11) and (VII. 2. 12).

The augment इट् however is not added in चिकीर्षति and जिहीर्षति, as they are formed from कृ 'to do' and हृ 'to lose', which do not take इट् at all. Because here, though the short ऋ is lengthened before सम्, by (VI. 4. 16), yet such lengthening will not make the roots long ॠ ending roots. Because the _anuvritti_ of the word _upadesa_ is understood here from (VII. 2. 10), so that the rule applies to those roots only which in _upadesa_' or _Dhatupatha_ end in long ॠ and not those whose ॠ is lengthened by some Grammatical rule. Moreover, the long ॠ in कृ and हृ is temporary only, as it is replaced by long ई ॥ (See (VI. 4. 16), for lengthening).

As जिगमिषिता इव आचरति = जिगामिंषित्रीयते, here there is इट् augment, because _atmanepada_ affix is not in the same _pada_ with गम्, but is _bahiranga_. Compare (VII. 2. 36) _vartika_.

He explains it by saying:- परस्मैपदेषु यो गमिरुपलक्षितस्तस्मात् सकारादेरार्धधातुकस्य इट् भवति ॥ According to him we have the forms संजिगंसिता and अधिजिगंसिता व्याकरणस्य ॥",
    "72059": "Thus वृत् – वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत्, विवृत्सति । वृध् वर्त्स्यति, अवर्त्स्यत् । विवृत्स्सति । शृधू । शर्त्स्यति । अशर्त्स्यत् । शिशृत्सति । स्यन्दू । स्यन्त्सति । अस्यन्त्स्यत् ।\n\nThe वृतादि roots are four वृत्, वृध्, शृध् and स्यन्द (_Bhuadi_ 795-798). In the examples, the _Parasmaipada_ forms are shown, because these roots are optionally _Parasmaipadi_ by (I. 3. 92) before स्य and सन् ॥\n\nObjection :- The word चतुर्भ्यः may conveniently have been omitted from the _sutra_. A reference to the _Dhatupatha_ will show that the वृतादि roots form a subdivision of द्युतादि roots, and stand at the end of _Dyutadi_ class. So that the _sutra_ न वृद्भ्यः would have been enough, and there would have been no uncertainty or vagueness about it, for the word वृतादि would mean 'the roots वृत् &c. with which the _Dyutadi_ class ends'. Thus we shall get the five roots 795 वृतुर्वर्तने 796 वृधु वृद्धौ, 797 शृधु शब्दकुत्सायाम्; 798 स्यन्दू प्रस्रवणे and कृपू सामर्थ्ये ॥ As regards the last root कृपू, we shall find from the next _sutra_, that the present _sutra_ applies to this root also. Or we can change the order of the roots, putting  कृपू first, and वृतु &c after it, so that वृतादि will mean four roots only. Whether _vritadi_ be taken to mean the five or the four roots, the word चतुर्भ्यः is redundant.\n\nAns:- The word चतुर्भ्यः is used in order that the prohibition contained in this _sutra_ may debar the 'option' which the root स्यन्दू would have taken, because of its indicatory long ऊ (VII. 2. 44). For this 'option' is an _antaranga_ operation, because it applies to all _ardhadhatuka_ affixes; while the 'prohibition' of the present _sutra_ is a _bahiranga_, because it applies to those affixes only which begin with स ॥ So that the 'prohibition' of this _sutra_ would not have debarred the 'option' of (VII. 2. 44): and in the _Parasmaipada_ स्यन्दू would have had two forms; which, however, is not the case because of the word चतुर्भ्यः by which the 'prohibition' is extended to स्यन्दू also. Thus in the _Parasmaipada_, we have only one form, as, स्यन्त्स्यति; but in the _Atmanepada_ we have two forms स्यन्दिष्यते or स्यन्त्स्यते ॥\n\nThe word '_Parasmaipada_' is understood in this _sutra_, so that the prohibition does not apply to _atmanepada_ affixes: as वर्त्तिषीष्ट, वर्तिष्यते, अवर्तिष्यत्, विवर्तिष्यते, स्यन्दिषीष्ट or स्यन्त्सीष्ट ॥ Moreover, with regard to _Atmanepada_ also, the इट् is added to these roots when they stand in the same '_pada_' with the affixes. But when the _Atmanepada_ affixes are added not to the roots '_vrit_ &c', but to the roots which are derived from the nominal bases formed from '_vrit_ &c', then the 'root' is not in the same _pada_ with the affix, and the prohibition of this _sutra_ will apply. As विवृत्सित्रीयते ॥ Moreover, the rule applies, as we have said, to the affixes standing in the same '_pada_' with the 'roots'; therefore it will apply to Desiderative roots, as विवृत्सति, though शप् here intervenes between the _ardhadhatuka_ affix सन् and the _Parasmaipada_ तिप्; so also, an _ekadesa_ though _sthanivat_ and therefore an intervention, will not be considered so for the purposes of this rule, as विवृत्सिष्यति; so also in विवृत्सयति ॥ This prohibition, moreover, applies to कृत् affixes, and where there is _luk_-elision of _Parasmaipada_ affixes. As विवृत्सिता; and विवृत्स त्वम् where the Imperative हि is _luk_ elided, and being so elided, the force of _Parasmaipada_ does not here remain by न लुमताङ्गस्य (I. 1. 63); hence the above _Ishti_.",
    "72060": "Thus कल्प्ता, कल्प्स्यति, अकल्प्स्यत्, चिक्लृप्स्यति ॥ But कल्पितासे, कल्पिषीष्ट, कल्पिष्यते, अकल्पिष्यत, चिकल्पिषते in the _Atmanepada_.\n\nIn the case of क्लृप् also, the इट् is added to the _ardhadhatuka_ affixes in the _Atmanepada_, when the root stands in the same _pada_ with the affixes and there is prohibition everywhere else. So also there is prohibition before _krit_-affixes, and the _luk_-elision of _Parasmaipada_. As चिक्लृप्सिता, चिक्लृप्स त्वं ॥\n\nAccording to _Padamanjari_, these two _sutras_ could have been shortened thụs:- (1) न वृद्भ्यः पञ्चभ्यः, (2) तासि च; and \"क्लृपः\" could well have been omitted. The तास् comes only after क्लृप and not after other roots of _Vritadi_ class, in _Parasmaipada_ (l. 3. 92) and (l. 3. 93). Therefore, there is no fear that the prohibition तासि च will apply to the other roots of _vritadi_, but only to '_klip_', because the word परस्मैपदिषु is understood here; and as no roots of _vritadi_ class take _Parasmaipada_ in the Periphrastic Future except '_klip_', there is no fear of any ambiguity.",

Observe भत्ता, बिभेदिथ ॥ Why 'like तास्'? Observe लूत्वा but लुलविथ, Why 'थल'? Observe याता but ययिव, ययिम ॥ The word नित्यं qualifies अनिट्, if therefore तास् be optionally _anit_, then the थल् will be सेट् always.

In fact, whereever there is want of इट्, whether by complete prohibition or optional prohibition, all that is regulated by (VII. 2. 13): this is the view adopted by the _Kasika_. But another view is that the prohibition of this _sutra_ applies to the इट् of (VII. 2. 13) only, but does not debar the option of (VII. 2. 44); so they have two forms विदुधोथ and विदुधविथ ॥ This view is applied by them to (VII. 2. 46), as सस्वर्थ or सस्वरिथ (VII. 2. 44).\n\nWhy have we used the word वत् in तास्वत् ?

As जघसिथ and उवयिथ ॥ Here the roots घस् and वय् the substitutes अद् and वेञ् respectively have no Periphrastic Future form, and hence this rule does not apply to them.",

Therefore we have जिघृक्षति, जिग्रहिथ ॥ Here the root ग्रह is _anit_ before सन् (VII. 2. 12) and not before तास् so it will not be _anit_ before थ ॥ The words नित्यम् अनिटः are also understood here. Therefore the rule does not apply to आनञ्जिथ (VII. 4. 71), (VII. 4. 72). For the root अञ्जू (VII. 21) takes optionally इट् before तास् (VII. 2. 44) as अञ्जिता and अङ्क्ता ॥",

Had it not been so, this rule would have been a _vidhi_ rule and not a _niyama_: because rule (VII. 2. 61) does not apply to long ॠ ending roots, and so if the present _sutra_ were to include long ॠ also, it could not be called a _niyama_ (restriction) of (VII. 2. 61).",

This is also a _niyama_ rule with regard to वृ for by (VII. 2.13) the root वृ was already _anit_, and its Perfect would have been ववर्थ by that rule. The special mention of this form shows that in secular literature this root is always सेट् before थ of the Perfect.",

The इट् is repeated in the aphorism for the sake of clearness, the rule could have stood without it, for the _anuvritti_ of 'optionally' could not have run into it from the last _sutra_: for if it was an optional _sutra_, the enumeration of अद् and व्य was useless, as they were already provided for by (VII. 2. 63). Therefore, this _sutra_ makes an invariable rule.",
    "72067": "Thus आदिवान्, ओशिवान्, पेचिवान्, शेकिवान् ॥ In the first two of these, the reduplicate stems आद् and आश् become of one syllable by the coalescence of अ अद् and अअश् ॥ In पेच् and शेक् the reduplicate is elided and the vowel अ changed to ए, and thus the reduplicate has become of one syllable. Of roots ending in आ we have, ययिवान्, तस्थिवान्, of घस्-जक्षिवान् ॥ This वस् would have taken the augment by the general rule of इट् increment, the present _sutra_ makes a _niyama_, so that the roots which are not monosyllabic in their reduplicate form are _anit_: as बिभिद्वान्, चिच्छिद्वान्, बभूवान्, शिश्रिवान् ॥ The _niyama_ is made with regard to the roots which would have taken इट् generally, as not being governed by the prohibition in (VII. 2. 13). The roots ending in long आ may consist of more than one syllable in their reduplicate form, as याया + वस्, hence their separate enumeration: as a matter of fact, however, these reduplicates also become monosyllabic ultimately by losing their आ ॥ The root दरिद्रा is not governed by this rule, for its Perfect will be formed periphrastically by (III. 1. 35) _Vartika_, because it consists of more than one syllable: as दरिद्रांचकार ॥ And when आम् is not added, there also दरिद्रा loses its final आ before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes by the _vartika_ under (VI. 4. 114). So the आ being elided before the adding of any affix, this becomes a root which no longer ends in आ, and so the cause of adding इट् under this _sutra_ no longer exists, and so no इट् is added. Thus we have ददरिद्वान्, for before _ardhadhatuka_ affixes दरिद्रा loses its आ ((VI. 4. 114) _Vartika_), and this elision being considered as _siddha_, ((VI. 4. 114) _Vartika_), no occasion remains for the augment इट् ॥ The घस् becomes जक्ष् in its reduplicate form (a stem of one syllable), but had it not been separately mentioned, then by (VI. 4. 100), the penultimate अ of घस् would have been elided first, before reduplication, because (VI. 4. 100), is subsequent in order to the rule ordaining reduplication. ((VI. 1. 14) &c). The अ being elided, we should have घ्स् only, which not having any vowel, could not be reduplicated. By its separate enumeration here, the augment इट् being ordained by a subsequent rule (VII. 2. 67), prevents even the rule of elision (VI. 4. 100). Having, therefore, first added इट्, we then elide the penultimate अ by (VI. 4. 98), this elided अ, however, becomes _sthanivat_ for the purposes of reduplication only by (I. 1. 52).

Observe चिकीर्ष्यात् ॥\n\nThe objector may say, the form चिकीर्ष्यात् will be so by the elision of अ under (VI. 4. 48), and so there is no necessity of reading the _anuvritti_ of _sarvadhatuka_ in this _sutra_; for when अ is elided by अतोलोपः (VI. 4. 48), in the case of _ardhadhatuka_ या the present rule cannot apply, as there is no base left which ends in अ ॥ To this we reply, this is not a good reason: for then in the case of पचेत् and यजेत् also, the rule अतो दीर्घो यञि (VII. 3. 101) would apply, and the अ of पच would require to be lengthened. But that is not so. The fact is that the present _sutra_ debars rule (VII. 3. 101). Therefore, as this इय् substitute debars the lengthening of (VII. 3. 101), so it would debar the _lopa_ of (VI. 4. 48). Therefore, if the _anuvritti_ of _sarvadhatuka_ be not read into this _sutra_, the इय् substitute would apply to _ardhadhatuka_ also, and the _lopa_-elision (VI. 4. 48) would not help, as that would be superseded by this special rule. Therefore the _anuvritti_ of \"_sarvadhatuka_\" should be read into this _sutra_.\n\nThe above is stated on general grounds. But if the maxim मध्येऽपवादाः पूर्वान् विधीन् बाधन्ते नोत्तरान् (_Apavadas_ that are surrounded by the rules which teach operations that have to be superseded by the _apavada_ operations, supersede only those rules that precede, not those that follow them) be applied here, then the present _sutra_ would supersede only the preceding _sutra_ (VI. 4. 48) and not the following _sutra_ (VII. 3. 101) for which would not be superseded by the present _sutra_. In this view also, the _lopa_ being superseded at all events, the _anuvritti_ of '_Sarvadhatuka_' must be read into this _sutra_.\n\nIn the दीर्घ rule (VII. 3. 101), the word '_sarvadhatuka_' is understood from (VII. 3. 95). But according to some, the word तिङि of (VII. 3. 88) is also understood there, so that they would lengthen the अ, before a _sarvadhatuka_ personal termination (तिङ्) only, and not before every _sarvadhatuka_ affix in general. According to this view, the present _sutra_ will debar only the _dirgha_ rule (VII. 3. 101) and not the _lopa_ rule (VI. 4. 48), on the maxim येन न प्राप्ति &c.\n\nThe word येयः in the _sutra_ is formed by या + इयः; and या is exhibited without any case-termination. Others say, the word is यः the sixth case of या formed on the analogy of विश्वपः by the elision of आ (VI. 4. 140). Then यः + इयः = य + इयः (VIII. 3. 19) after this elision, there ordinarily would take place no _sandhi_; as this elision is considered _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1) for the purposes of (VI. 1. 87). Contrary to this general rule, however, the _sandhi_ takes place here and we have येयः by (VI. 1. 87). The अ in इयः is for the sake of pronunciation only. The real substitute is इय् ॥\n\nSome read the _sutra_ as अतो यासियः ॥ So that the _sthani_ is यास् and not या, and यासियः is a genitive compound.",

But the grammatical construction of the word ङित् in the two _sutras_ (I. 2. I) and (I. 2. 4) is not the same. In the first _sutra_, it means ङिति इव - ङित्वत्, i. e. the roots गा कुट् &c are treated in the same way as they would have been treated, had a ङित् affix followed. But in the second _sutra_ (I. 2. 4), the word ङिद्वत् is equal to ङित इव \"like of ङित्\" ॥ The _sutra_ (I. 2. 1). is so explained in order to evolve the form उच्चुकुटिषति ॥ For when the सन् is added to कुट्, the root कुट् is treated as if the सन् was a ङित् affix, and so there is no _guna_. But if सन् itself had become ङित् then the Desiderative root चुकुटिष्, being a ङित् root would require _atmanepada_ affixes by अनुदात्तङित आत्मनेपदम् (1. 3. 12). In the case, however, of _sarvadhatuka_-_apit_-affixes, the affixes themselves become like ङित्, and are treated as ङित् affixes, not only with regard to the stem preceding them, but with regard to their own selves also, as we see in the present _sutra_.",
    "72082": "Thus पचमानः, यचमानः ॥\n\nThis मुक् is part and parcel of अ only, and not of the _anga_. For if मुक् be considered as part of the _anga_, then it will be an intervention, and make the _anga_ end in a consonant and so there will be anomaly in accent. For by (VI. 1. 186), the ल _sarvadhatuka_ affix is _anudatta_ after a stem ending in अ; so if मुक् be considered part of the _anga_, the stem no longer ends in अ but म्; but if it be considered as a portion of अ only, then the _anga_ still remains अदुपदेश (VI. 1. 186). So the accent of पचमानः and यजमानः is governed by (VI. I. 186).\n\nAn objector may say, \"if this be so, then the stem पचम् is still considered as ending in अ, and therefore in पचम् + आन, we should apply the previous _sutra_ (VII. 2. 81), and change अ into इय्\" ॥ To this we reply, 'no, it cannot be so; for the त् in अत् (VII. 2. 80) shows that the अ consisting of one _matra_ is to be taken, but when मुक्  is added, this अ becomes one _matra_ and half, so the rule (VII. 2. 81) will not apply; because it applies only to अ of one _matra_'. The objector:- \"If this is so, then the _anudatta_ of (VI. I. 186) will not also hold good, for there also the अत् means the अ of one _matra_.\" This is no valid objection. For there the word उपदेश is taken, so that a stem which at the time of _upadesa_ or first enunciation, ends in a short अ of one _matra_, is governed by that rule; though after the enunciation, the short अ may be lengthened in its _matra_. It is for this reason that the rule (VI. 1. 186) applies to पचावः and पचामः; though the short अ is subsequently lengthened before व and म by (VII. 3. 101).\n\nOr the _sutra_ may have been made as आनस्य मुट्, and the augment म् would then be added to आन and not to the verbal stem. All the above difficulties would be removed by this view. But then the final अ of पच &c would require to be lengthened before मान by (VII. 3. 101). This objection, however, is not insuperable, for one view of (VII. 3. 101) is that the word तिङि is understood there, so that the lengthening would take place only before a तिङ् affix beginning with a यञ् vowel : and not before any other affix.",

For there will be elision universally before all case-affixes. This is the general rule. To this there is the exception that before non-substitute case-affixes there will be य (VII. 2. 89). To this latter, there is an exception that before non-substitute case-endings beginning with a consonant, आ comes. Thus without any confusion, the आ, the य, and the _lopa_ find their respective scopes.\n\nWhen there is elision, why is not टाप् added in the Feminine; in त्वं ब्राह्मणी; अहं ब्राह्मणी ? The टाप् is not added on the maxim सन्निपात लक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य 'a rule which is occasioned by a certain combination, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination.' Because the ending in अ of युष्मद् and अस्मद् was occasioned by _vibhakti_ combination, if this latter occasion टाप्, then it will destroy its own fruit.\n\nOr the words युष्मद् and अस्मद् may be taken to have no gender, and equally applicable to both masculine and feminine.\n\nIn order to avoid all this difficulty about टाप् some would elide the अद् (or टि portion) of युष्मद् and अस्मद् under this _sutra_. They argue that by the next _sutra_ (VII. 2. 91), the portions '_yushm_' and '_asm_', namely the portions upto म् of युष्मद् and अस्मद् are replaced by substitutes. The portion that remains (शेष) is अद्, and it is this अद् which is to be elided.\n\nWhy is this '_lopa_' taught again, when by (VII. 2. 102), all त्यदादि pronouns have अ substituted for their finals before case-endings; and so would _yushmad_ and _asmad_, lose their finals and become _yushma_ and _asma_ by that rule? That rule does not apply to _yushmad_ and _asmad_, because by an _ishti_ that rule is restricted to _tyadadi_ pronouns upto द्वि, thus excluding युष्मद्, अस्मद्, भवतु and किम् ॥",

Similarly (VII. 2. 97) teaches that त्व and म replace '_yushmad_' and '_asmad_' in the singular; by this _sutra_ '_yushm_' and '_asm_' are only replaced. Thus त्वया, मया, the अद् portion remains for which य is substituted by (VII. 2. 89). Had the whole been replaced, then the अ of त्व and म would have been replaced by य (VII. 2. 89), and given us undesired forms like त्व्या and म्या ॥ Why is the word पर्यन्त employed in the _sutra_ and not the word अन्त, as मान्तस्य? In the first place this word अन्त is ambiguous, it may mean ending with म् but excluding म्, or ending with म् and including म् ॥ In the second place, the word पर्यन्त is used to indicate the limit, or portion taken out of the whole. The word मान्त would have meant, that form of _yusmad_ and _asmad_ which ends with म् ॥ Now these words have a form which ends in म्, as युष्मानाचष्टे or अस्मानाचष्टे = युष्मते or अस्मते formed by णिच् (the टि portion अद् is elided by (VII. 4. 155), _vartika_).

This objection is not valid, for there the _vibhaktis_ have been elided. But is not elision a _Bahiranga_ and the substitute an _antaranga_ process; and should not, therefore, the substitute come first and then the _vibhakti_ elided? The substitution specially taught in this _sutra_ is, therefore, a _jnapaka_ and proves the existence of the following maxim :-  अन्तरङ्गानपि विधीन् बहिरङ्गोलुग्बाधते 'a _bahiranga_ substitution of लुक् supersedes even _antaranga_ rules'. Thus गोमान् प्रियोऽस्य = गोमत्प्रियः, here the _antaranga_ नुम् augment is superseded by the _bahiranga_ लुक् ॥ This _sutra_ further indicates, that all other substitutes of '_yushmad_' and '_asmad_' which take place in the singular, such as तव, मम, तुभ्य, मह्य, त्व, अह, do not take effect, before general affixes or in compounds, but that त्व and म are the only substitutes there even. As तुभ्यं हितं = त्वद्धितं, मद्धितं ॥ तव पुत्रः = त्वत्पुत्रः, मत्पुत्रः ॥",

Observe त्रयः, चत्वारः, त्रीणि, चत्वारि ॥ The word स्त्रियाम् qualifies त्रि and चतुर् and not the word अङ्ग 'stem' which is of course understood here. Therefore, the substitution will take place even where the _anga_ refers to a Masculine, or a Neuter; when त्रि and चतुर् refer to a Feminine; as प्रियास्तिस्रो ब्राह्मण्योऽस्य ब्राह्मणस्य = प्रियतिस्रा ब्राह्मणः (VII.

Conversely, the _anga_ may be feminine, but if त्रि and चतुर् refer to Masculine or Neuter nouns, the substitution will not take place: as प्रियास्त्रयोऽस्याः or प्रियाणि त्रीणि वा अस्या ब्राह्मण्याः = प्रियत्रिः 'a _Brahmani_ to whom three are beloved.' dual. प्रियत्रीः, प्रियत्रयः ॥ Similarly प्रियचत्वाः, प्रियचत्वारौ, प्रियचत्वारः ॥\n\nVart:- The substitution of तिसृ for त्रि takes place before the affix कन्; as तिसृका नाम ग्रामः ॥\n\nVart:- चतसृ has acute on the first, as च꣡तस्रः पश्य ॥ Rule (VI. 1. 167) does not apply.

The last rule (VII. 3. 110), though subsequent in order, is however superseded by this rule. Why 'before the affixes beginning with a vowel?' Observe तिसृभिः, चतसृभिः ॥ The ॠतः of the _sutra_ refers to the ॠ of तिसृ and चतसृ and not to a ॠ ending stem in general: and had it not been used in the _sutra_, the latter would have stood thus अचिरः \"र् is substituted for the final of the words above-mentioned before an affix beginning with a vowel.\" So र् would have been substituted for the final of त्रि and चतुर् also.",

The जरस् substitution takes place in the Neuter plural, when the augment नुम् is added: as अतिजरांसि ब्राह्मणकुलानि ॥ In अतिजरसं ब्राह्मणकुलं पश्य the affix is not elided. The form is thus evolved: अतिजर + अम् ॥ Here three rules present themselves simultaneously; first, _luk_-elision of the affix अम् by (VII. 1. 23), (2) then the अम् substitution by (VII. 1. 24), (3) and thirdly, जरस् for जर by this rule. Of these लुक्-elision is superseded by अम् of (VII. 1. 24) which is an exception to (VII. 1. 23); and in its turn अम् is replaced by the जरस् of this _sutra_. जरस् being substituted for जर, we have अतिजरस्, now _luk_ cannot again appear and cause elision, as it has already lost the opportunity: and we are left with अम् alone, and have अतिजरसं ॥ In the Nominative Singular and Instrumental Plural we have अतिजरं and अतिजरैः according to the opinion of _Gonardiya_. The reason being सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य 'that which is taught in a rule the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination'. Because अम् was added to अतिजर because it ended in अ (VII. 1. 24), and similarly भिः was replaced by ऐस् (VII. 1. 9). Now अ has caused the production of अम् and ऐस्, therefore, these latter affixes, though beginning with a vowel will not cause जरस् to be substituted for जर by this rule, for then the produced will cause the destruction of the producer. Others hold that the above maxim is _anitya_, and we have Nominative Singular अतिजरसं, and Instrumental Plural अतिजरसैः ॥\n\nThe form अतिजरांसि is thus evolved अतिजर + इ ॥ Here if the नुम् augment be added first, it will be a portion of the _anga_, and will not be an intervention to anything which is to be added or operated upon the _anga_. But this augment will be an intervention with regard to जरा which is but a portion of the word अतिजर ॥ So that an operation applicable to जरा will not take effect, because of this नुम् intervention. And though _tadantaviddhi_ applies in these chapters (पदाङ्गाधिकारे तस्य च तदन्तस्य च), yet the maxim is that the substitutes only replace those which are specifically exhibited in a rule (निर्दिश्यमानस्य आदेशा भवन्ति), therefore जरस् would not replace जरा which forms only a portion of a full word अतिजर ॥ Even if the substitution does take place, the नुम् would be found after the स् of जरस् ॥ Therefore, the जरस् substitution should be made first, because this is a subsequent rule; and having done so, the नुम् should be added afterwards under (VII. 1. 72).\n\nThe form अतिजरसं is thus evolved. We have अतिजर + अम् ॥ Here on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्य अनन्यत्वात्, we substitute जरस् for जर also, (for जर and जरा are considered as one). Then appears (VII. 1. 23) ordaining the _luk_ of अम् and (VII. 1. 24), teaching अम् ॥ The latter rule is preferred for the reasons given above.",

Therefore, the substitution does not take place here in भवत् which forms भवान् ॥ When the word त्यद् &c are employed as names, or as a secondary member in a compound, the substitution does not take place, as त्यद्, त्यदौ, त्यदः, अतित्यद्, अतित्यदौ, अतित्यदः See also (l. 1. 27) commentary. But when they form the principal member of a compound, the substitution takes place, as परमसः, परमतौ, परमते ॥ For case affix (_vibhakti_) see (V. 3. 1) also.

A substitute would be a _bahiranga_ with regard to a case-affix that should be added to a compound. Therefore, being an _antaranga_ rule, the _ekadesa_ should be made first, and this _ekadesa_ being considered as the beginning of the subsequent word, we should get erroneous forms like परमहम्, परमयं instead of परमाहम् and परमायम् &c. Hence the necessity of the above _vartika_.\n\n_Karika :- Let the _sutra_ be अदस औ without the words सुलोपश्च ॥ The word सौ is understood here from the preceding aphorism. The word अदसः is in the ablative case, the word सौ which is in the 7th case, should be changed here into the 6th case सोः ॥ The _sutra_ would then mean अदस उत्तरस्य सोरौकारो भवति – औ is substituted for the सु after अदस् ॥ Then the final अस् of अदस् is changed to अ by (VII. 2. 102), and द् is changed to स् by (VII. 2. 106), and we have असौ ॥ So where is the necessity of using the words सुलोपश्च in the _sutra_.\n\nObjection:- If औ be substituted for सु, then in the vocative this औ should be elided by (VI. 1. 69), as it comes after a short vowel अ of (VII. 2. 102). Answer:- औ will not be elided by (VI. 1. 69), for that rule refers to the elision of a consonantal affix only, the word हलः being understood in that _sutra_, from the preceding _sutra_ (VI. 1. 68).\n\nObjection:- If this be so, then in the Feminine Vocative we have असा + औ, and by the rule (VII. 3. 106), the आ should be changed to ए before this औ ॥ Answer:- No, this will not be so, for the द substitution takes place only before a झल् beginning affix, for the word झलि is understood in the _sutra_ (VII. 3. 106) from the _sutra_ (VII. 3. 103).\n\nObjection:- If this be so, then in the feminine with अकच्, we have, असका + औ, and here rule (VII. 3. 41) shows itself and requires the अ of स to be changed to इ (असिका) before the क of an affix. Answer:- That rule (VII. 3. 44) applies where the feminine affix आ is audible and remains unchanged, but here it is changed to औ (_Vrddhi_ अ । + औ = औ) in असकौ ॥\n\nObjection:- But then in असा + औ, the औ would require to be changed to शी by (VII. 1. 18). Answer:- This objection is partial only, for औङ् in (VII. I. 18) is explained by some, to be the common name given by ancient grammarians to the औ of Dual; and not to this औ; moreover, in masculine no objection can apply.

The _Tadanta_-_viddhi_, as a general rule, does not apply to compounds, so that a rule made applicable to a particular word, will not apply to a compound which ends with that word: but _tadanta_-_viddhi_ applies to a word denoting season when it takes an affix causing _Vriddhi_, and is preceded by a word denoting a portion. We draw this rule from the present _sutra_, for हैमनं being formed from हेमन्त by a _vriddhi_-causing affix (IV. 3. 22), the affix अण् will be applied to हेमन्त even when it is the second member of a compound, the first member of which denotes a part. (ऋतोर्वृद्धिमद्विधाववयवात् ( I. 1. 72) _Vartika_ _Mahabhashya_).\n\nWhy do we say 'denoting a portion'? Observe पूर्वासु वर्षासु भवं पौर्ववर्षिकम् with ठञ् (IV. 3. 11). The _tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies only when the first member denotes a portion.",
    "73012": "As सुपाञ्चालकः, सर्वपाञ्चालकः and अर्धपाञ्चालकः, formed with वुञ् (IV. 2. 125). This _sutra_ also gives rise to the following rule सुसर्वार्धदिक् शब्देभ्यो जनपदस्य \"The _tadantavidhi_ applies to words denoting country, when the first member is सु, सर्व, अर्ध or a direction-denoting word\". As shown in the above examples, and for direction denoting words see the following _sutra_ ((1. 1. 72) _Vartika_ _Malabhashya_).",
    "73013": "As पूर्वपाञ्चालकः, अपरपाञ्चालकः, दक्षिणपाञ्चालकः, उत्तरपाञ्चालकः ((IV. 2. 125), (IV. 2. 107), (IV. 2. 108). (VI. 2. 105) accent). The _Tadanta_-_vidhi_ applies here, as shown in the preceding _sutra_. Why do we say 'denoting direction'? Observe पूर्वः पाञ्चालानां = पूर्वपञ्चालः, तत्र भवः, = पौर्वपञ्चालकः, आपरपञ्चालकः ॥ With मद्र we have पौर्वमद्रः, आपरमद्रः with अञ् (IV. 2. 108). The separation of this _sutra_ from the last is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_.",
    "73014": "Thus पूर्वैषुकामशमः, अपरैषुकामशमः, पूर्वकार्ष्णमृत्तिकः, अपरकार्ष्णमृत्तिकः (IV. 2. 107). These are village names. पूर्वपाटलिपुत्रकः, अपरपाटलिपुत्रकः, पूर्वकान्यकुब्जः, अपरकान्यकुब्जः ॥\n\nThe word प्राचां in this _sutra_, as well as in (VII. 3. 24), does not here mean 'the eastern grammarians', but 'the eastern countries', because of the context. पूर्वैषुकामशमः is this formed. पूर्वा च असौ इषुकामशमी = पूर्वेषुकामशमी ॥ The compounding takes place by (II. 1. 50). Then the affix ञ is added to it, in the sense of ततो भवः by (IV. 2. 107). In पूर्वपाटलिपुत्रकः the affix वुञ् is added by (IV. 2. 123). Though _Pataliputra_ is the name of one city, _Purva_-_pataliputra_ means the Eastern portion of the city _Pataliputra_. \n\nThat place is called '_grama_', where people reside, and a 'nagara' is also a '_grama_' in this sense. Therefore, the rules which good men observe with regard to '_grama_', are observed by them in '_nagara_' also. Thus the rule is अभक्ष्यो ग्रामकुक्कुटः, therefore, the नागर cock is also not eaten. So also ग्रामे नाध्ययम् is applied to _nagara_ also. In this grammar also, we see that '_grama_' includes '_nagara_' also, as in (IV. 2. 109), (IV. 2. 117), (VI. 2. 103). Therefore, where is the necessity of employing the word नगर separately in this aphorism? The two words are separately used, in order to indicate the separate nature and relation of the two kinds of words. The full word पूर्वेषुकामशमी is the name of a '_grama_', and not the portion इषुकामशमी ॥ But in पूर्वपाटलिपुत्र, the word पाटलिपुत्र itself is the name of the '_nagara_'. In the present _sutra_, there is the _adhikara_ of अङ्गस्य and of उत्तरपदस्य ॥ We apply these separately to these two classes of words: namely ग्रामवाचिनाम् अङ्गानाम् and नगरवाचिनाम् उत्तरपदानाम् ॥ This we could not have done without employing these words in the _sutra_. Therefore, in the case of '_grama_' word, the _vriddhi_ takes place in that portion of it which follows a direction denoting word (ग्रामवाचिनामङ्गानामवयवस्य दिकशब्दादुत्तरस्य वृद्धिर्भवति). While a _nagara_ word itself gets _vriddhi_ when it is preceded by a direction denoting word (दिशः उत्तरेषां नगराणाम्) ॥ In पूर्वैषुकामशमः, the _vriddhi_ of इषुकामशमी takes place first, and then the combination by _sandhi_. See on this point (VII. 3. 22).",
    "73015": "Thus द्विसांवत्सरिकः = द्वौ संवत्सरावधीष्टो भृतो भूतो or भावी (V. 1. 80), त्रिसांवत्सरिकः, द्विषाष्ठिकः = द्वे षष्टी अधीष्टो भृतो भूतो भावी वा ॥ The words द्वि, षष्टी &c when applied to वर्ष (VII. 3. 16) and Numerals give rise to the affixes taught under _kaladhikara_ (V. 1. 78) – (V. 1. 97). The special mention of संवत्सर here, (though this is a परिमाण word and would have been included in the _sutra_ (VII. 3. 17)) implies that the word परिमाण in that _sutra_ does not mean the measure of time, but a measure of any other thing than time. Therefore, with other time-words than _samvatsara_, the _Vriddhi_ takes place in the regular way: as द्वैसमिकः, त्रैसमिकः ॥ Similarly in _sutra_ (IV. 1. 22), the word परिमाण does not mean the measure of time or numerals, as त्रिवर्षा, द्विवर्षा माणविका ॥ In short, the word परिमाण in these _sutras_ (and elsewhere (III. 2. 23), (II. 3. 46) &c.) means \"mass or bulk\", and not a measure in general.",
    "73016": "As द्विवर्षे अधीष्टो भृतो भूतो वा = द्विवार्षिकः, त्रिवार्षिकः ॥ But when denoting future time, we have द्वैवर्षिकः, त्रैवर्षिकः \"calculated to last two or three years\" as in the sentence यस्य त्रैवर्षिकं धान्यं निहितं भृत्यवृत्तये अधिकं वापि विद्येत स सोमं पातुमर्हति ॥ (= त्रीणि वर्षाणि भावी). The word अभविष्यत् does not qualify the words अधीष्ट and भृत (V. I. 80), the sense of futurity is there denoted by the sentence and not by the _taddhita_-affix: as द्वे वर्षे अधीष्टो भृतो वा कर्म करिष्यति = द्विवार्षिको मनुष्यः ॥",
    "73017": "As द्वौ कुडवौ प्रयोजनमस्य = द्विकौडविकः (V. 1. 109) द्वाभ्यां सुवर्णाभ्यां क्रीतं = द्विसौवर्णिकम् (V. 1. 37), त्रिसौवर्णिकम् ॥ The _taddhita_ affix is optionally elided, see _vartika_ to (V. 1. 29). When the affix is elided there can be no _Vriddhi_, as द्विसुवर्णम् ॥ Similarly द्विनैष्किकम्, त्रिनैष्किकम् (V. I. 30). Why 'when it is not a name'? Observe पाञ्चलोहितिकम्, पाञ्चकपालिकम् (= पञ्चलोहित्यः or कपलानि परिमाणमस्य (V. I. 30) The whole word is a Name here. Why with the exception of शाण? Observe द्वैशाणम्, त्रैशाणम् formed with अण् (V. I. 35) and (V. I. 36). Some read the _sutra_ as असंज्ञाशाणकुलिजानाम् so that कुलिज is also excepted, as द्वैकुलिजिकः ((V. 1. 55) द्वेकुलिजे प्रयोजनमस्य) ॥",
    "73018": "The word ज means 'born', the affixes denoting 'born under that asterism' are meant here. प्रोष्ठपद is the name of an asterism, the time appertaining there to is also called प्रोष्ठपद (the affix अण् of (IV. 3. 3), is elided by IV.2. 4). प्रोष्ठपदासु जातः = प्रोष्ठपादो माणवकः (with अण् (IV. 3. 16)). Why do we say 'born in that time'? Observe यदा प्रौष्ठपदोमेघः (= प्रोष्ठपदासु भवः) धरणीमभिवर्षति ॥ The plural number प्रोष्ठपदानां indicates that the synonyms of प्रोष्ठपद such as भद्रपाद are also to be included.",

The words सुभगा and दुर्भगा occur in the _Kalyanadi_ class (IV. 1. 126), and the affix ढक् and इन् augment are added. सुभग also occurs in _Udgatri_ class (V. 1. 129). That word, however, does not get the _Vriddhi_ in the second member, As महते सौभगाय ॥ This is a Vedic anomaly. Similarly from सक्तुसिन्धवः (= सक्तुप्रधानाः सिन्धवः) we have साक्तुसैन्धवः (= सक्तुसिन्धुषु भवः) so also पानसिन्धवः ॥ The word सिन्धु occurs in _Kachchhadi_ class, and सैन्धवः is formed by अण् ॥ The _Tadanta_-rule applies to words formed there-under.\n\nThe words सुहृद् and दुर्हृद् are anomalously formed by (V. 4. 150). But the reading adopted by _Kasika_ is सुहृदयस्येदम्; so the word _hridaya_ is changed to _hrid_ by (VI. 3. 50) or (VI. 3. 51). The word _sindhu_ means 'a country', 'a river' or 'an ocean'.",

Some read this word as अस्यहत्य; this will also take अण् as belonging to विमुक्तादि class. As आस्यहात्यः (= अस्यहत्यशब्दोऽस्मिन्नध्यायेऽस्ति) Others read this as अस्यहेतिः, as आस्यहैतिकः (= अस्यहेतिः प्रयोजनमस्य).

This prohibition indicates the existence of the following maxim : बहिरङ्गमपि पूर्वोत्तरपदयोः पूर्वं कार्यं भवति, पश्चादेकादेशः or in other words पूर्वोत्तरनिमित्तकार्यात् पूर्वमन्तरङ्गोऽप्येकादेशो न ॥ \"The substitution of one vowel for the final of the first and the initial of the second member of a compound does, even when it is _antaranga_, not take place previously to an operation which concerns the first or the second member of the compound\". It is on this maxim that the forms पूर्वशुकामशम (VII. 3. 14) &c are constructed, otherwise उ being the first vowel of the second member (इ of इषु having merged in पूर्व), would have been _vriddhied_.",

This word is derived from the compound word अग्नीवरुणौ the इ of अग्नि being lengthened by (VI. 3. 27). But in forming a _Taddhita_- derivative from this word, the long ई is shortened by (VI. 3. 28), and therefore, it cannot be said that a long vowel precedes वरुण ॥",

Observe अर्ध खार्याम् भवः = अर्धखारी ॥ Here _Vriddhi_ is substituted for the आ of खारी, and though the form remains the same, the power of this word is changed. For अर्धखारी being formed by a _Taddhita_ affix causing _Vriddhi_, in forming a _Bahuvrihi_ compound, this word will retain its feminine form and will not be changed into masculine under (VI. 3. 39) as अर्धखारीभार्यः (= अर्धखारीभार्यायस्य) (वृद्धिनिमित्तस्य च तद्धितस्य &c.) Whereever _Vriddhi_ is prohibited with regard to a _Taddhita_ affix, that affix cannot be called वृद्धिनिमित्त, and a word formed with such an affix will become masculine in a _Bahuvrihi_ compound referring to a male person, वैयाकरणी भार्या अस्य = वैयाकरणभार्यः ॥ The word वैयाकरण is formed by prohibition of _Vriddhi_.

They argue that by (V. 1. 121), all affixes denoting भाव are prohibited after a _Tatpurusha_ compound with the negative particle; therefore, the words शुचि &c, should be first developed by the addition of भाव-affixes, and then they should be compounded with the negative particle, which may be optionally _vriddhied_ by this rule, which would apply to it, though it is not an _anga_, because the rule teaches _vriddhi_. Others controvert this opinion, and hold that other affixes causing _vriddhi_ than भाव-affixes, also come after negative-_Tatpurusha_ compounds, such as affixes denoting descendant &c: and भाव-affixes are added to _Bahuvrihi_ negative compounds also, therefore, the force of the _anuvritti_ of अङ्ग, which is understood up to the end of the Seventh _Adhyaya_ (VI. 1. 1), and a fortiori in this _sutra_ also, should not be set aside as the above interpretation would do. Moreover the full _Taddhita_ compounds अक्षेत्रज्ञ and अनीश्वर are read in the list of _Brahmanadi_ words (V. 1. 124), and as such they take the भाव affix ष्यञ् which would have always caused the _vriddhi_ of अ, but for this _sutra_ which makes it optional. Therefore it is a _prapta_-_vibhasha_.",
    "73031": "That is, when the Negative particle gets the _vriddhi_, the words remain unchanged; and when these words are _vriddhied_, the negative particle remains unaltered. As आयथातथ्यम् or अयाथातथ्यम्, आयथापुर्यम् or अयाथापुर्यम् ॥ The words अयथातथ and अयथापुर should be considered to belong, as negative compounds, to _Brahmanadi_ class (V. 1. 124): and take ष्यञ् ॥ In the _sutra_ the compounds यथातथ and यथापुर are exhibited and are _Avyayibhavas_ (II. 1. 7), and being neuters, the आ of तथा and पुरा are shortened. According to _Patanjali_ this _sutra_ is superfluous. When the negative particle takes _Vriddhi_, the compound should be analysed as, न यथातथा = अयथातथा, अयथातथा भावः = आयथातथ्यम् ॥ When the second member gets the _vriddhi_, the compound should be analysed as, यथातथा भावः = याथातथ्यं, न याथातथ्यम् = अयाथातथ्यम् ॥",

Similarly with कृत् affixes, as शमकः, तमकः, दमकः, शमः, तमः, दमः ॥ Why do we say 'acutely accented'? Observe यामकः, रामकः ॥ How do you explain उद्यम and उपरम? These are irregular forms exhibited by _Panini_ himself in the _Dhatupatha_ अडउद्यमे (_Bhuadi_ 380), यम उपरमे (_Bhuadi_ 1033) Why do we use \"in the original enunciation or _upadesa_\"? So that the rule may apply to शमी, दमी, तमी, but not to याममः, रामकः ॥ Here to the root शम्, तम् and दम् is added the affix घिनुण् (III. 2. 141). The words शमिन्꣡ &c. get the affix-accent, namely acute इ꣡; and thus the root-vowel becomes _anudatta_. Though the root now becomes _anudatta_, yet because in its _upadesa_ it was _udatta_, the present _sutra_ will apply and prevent _vriddhi_. The roots यम्, रम् are _anudatta_ in _upadesa_, but in यामकः, रामकः they become _udatta_ by लित् accent. This accent is a secondary accent and not the 'original' accent; and hence the present rule does not apply and there is _vriddhi_. Why do we say ending in म्? Observe चारकः पाठकः ॥ Why with the exception of आचम्? Observe आचामकः ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of the roots आ-चम्, कम् and वम्, as वामः, कामः and आचामः ॥ In the case of कस्, the affix घञ् is added in that alternative, when the root does not take the affix णिङ् (III. 1. 31). It thus gets _vriddhi_.\n\nThe word आमः is formed from the _Churadi_ अम्, which with the affix णिच् gets _Vriddhi_, because णिच् is not a _krit_-affix, and is not therefore governed by this rule. If you say \"let there be _vriddhi_ of णिच्, but this _vriddhi_ will be shortened by (VI. 4. 92) because it is a मित् root\", we reply \"this root is not मित्\" ॥ The मित् roots are those enumerated in _Bhuadi_ class, subdivision घटादिः (800). No doubt, there it is said that the roots ending in अम् are मित् (in अमन्ताश्च). But a root is regarded मित् only with regard to the Causative णिच् affix, and not with regard to that णिच् of the _Churadi_ class where the sense of the causative is not involved in it. Therefore this root is not मित् (VI. 4. 93).\n\nThe phrases सूर्यविश्रामा भूमिः and others like it are incorrect. Why do we say 'चिण् and _krit_ only'? Observe शशाम, ददाम, चचाम ॥",

Similarly री includes रीङ् स्रवणे (_Divadi_ 30), and री गतिरेषणयोः (_Kryadi_ 30). The augment is added at the end of the preceding stem of root, and not to the affix. Being added to the root it becomes part of the root-stem, and in forming the reduplicate Aorist of such stems, the vowel before प् is shortened by (VII. 4. 1). If प् were not the part of the stem, that vowel would not be shortened. Thus from दापयति; we have Aorist अदीदपत् ॥",
    "73037": "As निशाययति, अवच्छाययति, अवसाययति, ह्वाययति, संव्याययति, वाययति, and पाययति ॥ The word पा includes the root पा 'to drink'. (_Bhuadi_ 972) पे 'to dry' (_Bhuadi_ 968). but not पा 'to protect' (_Adadi_ 47): because the latter looses the शप् _vikarana_.\n\nVart:- The root पा 'to protect' takes the augment लुक् before णि, as पालयति ॥\n\nVart:- The roots घुञ् and प्रीञ् take the augment नुक् before णि, as धूनयति, प्रीणयति ॥\n\nAll these augments are added to the roots, in order that (VII. 4. 1) should cause the shortening of the vowel preceding these. Thus the Aorist of the above are: अशीशयत्, अपीपलत्, अदूधुनत्, अपीप्रिणत् ॥\n\nThe roots शा, छा, सा, ह्वा, व्या and पा are exhibited as ending in long आ their _Dhatupatha_ forms are श, शो, छो, सै, सो, ह्वे, व्ये and पै ॥ This indicates that these roots would have taken पुक् by the last _sutra_, the word आत् 'ending in long आ' means the roots which actually end in long आ, as well as those which get long आ by (VI. 1. 45). This also indicates, that in this subdivision or section, the maxim of _lakshana_ _pratipadokta_ &c does not apply. Therefore when the roots इ with अपि, and जि assume the form अधि-आ and जा before the affix णि by (VI. I. 48), the augment पुक् is added to them, thus अध्यापयति, जापयति ॥",
    "73038": "As पक्षेणोपवाजयति ॥ But आ वापयति केशान् when the sense is not that of shaking. This form could have been obtained from the root वज् 'to move\", (_Bhuadi_ 271) with the affix णि in the ordinary way without any augment. The special augment ज् to वा indicates that this root will not take युक्, which it would have otherwise done by the last _sutra_. The root वा belongs to _Bhuadi_ 969(ओवै शोषणे) ॥",
    "73039": "As वि लीनयति, वि लालयति, वि लाययति, or वि लापयति घृतम् ॥ The augment नुक् is added to ली when the root ends in long ई, and that also optionally. When the augment is not added, the regular causative लाययति is formed. But when ली gets the form ला by (VI. I. 51), it does not take the augment नुक् ॥ The root ली includes both ली and लीङ् of _Kryadi_ and _Divadi_. The root ला includes ला 'to give' (_adadi_ 49), and ला the form assumed by ली under (VI. 1. 51). When लुक् is not added to ला, पुक् is added by (VII. 3. 36). Why do we say when meaning 'to melt fat'? Observe only लोहे विलापयति, जटाभिरालापयते (I. 3. 70).",
    "73040": "As मुण्डो भीषयते, जटिलो भीषयते ॥ See (I. 3. 68). Herealso भी with long ई being employed in the _sutra_, indicates that षुक् is added then only, when the root has the form भी, but when it assumes the form भा by (VI. I. 56), the proper augment पुक् will come: as मुण्डो भापयते ॥ Why do we say 'when the agent of the causative is himself the direct cause of fear'? Observe कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति, for here कुञ्चिका causes fear and not the agent of the verb. The ई is _vriddhied_ and आय substituted.",
    "73041": "As स्फावयति ॥",
    "73042": "As पुष्पाणि शातयति, फलानि शातयति, but गाः शादयति गोपालकः ॥",
    "73043": "As व्रीहीन् रोपयति or रोहयति ॥ According to _Padamanjari_ this _sutra_ could be dispensed with. The form रोपयति could be obtained from the root रुप् of _Divadi_ class : which though meaning मोहन may be taken to mean 'grow' also; अनेकार्थत्वाद् धातूनाम् ॥",
    "73044": "That which stands in an affix is called प्रत्ययस्थ, i.e. क् must be the part of the affix. The अक् is changed into इक् in the feminine in आ ॥ As जटिलिका, मुण्डिका, गुणिका, दत्तिका, कारिका, हारिका  So also एतिका from एतद् + अकच् + आप् एतकद् + आप् ॥ The द् is then replaced by अ (VII. 2. 102). The क् must belong to the affix, therefore, not in शका from शक शक्नोति ॥ The स्थ in प्रत्ययस्थ is for the sake of distinctness, there is no affix which is only क ॥  The rule applies to क, therefore not to नन्दना, रमणा ॥ The इ is substituted for the अ which precedes (पूर्वस्य) क्, and not the अ which follows क्, as पटुका, मृदुका ॥ The must be preceded by short अ, therefore, not here गोका, नौका, nor in राका, धाका ॥ The substitution takes place when आ follows, therefore, not in कारकी ॥ The word आपि qualifies क् ॥ The क् should be followed by आ ॥ Objection: But in कारिका from कारक + आ, क् is not directly followed by आ, but by अ? Answer: When अ + आ = आ there is _ekadesa_, the क् is followed by आ, there being no third letter intervening then. Objection: But an _ekadesa_ is _sthanivat_ to what it replaces when a _purva_-_vidhi_ is to be applied, therefore there still exists the intervention. Answer: The express text of this _sutra_ will remove the intervention. Objection: Then इ should be substituted in रथकट्या and गर्गकाम्या ॥ These words are formed by the affixes कट्यच् and काम्यच्, as रथानां समूहः, (IV. 2. 51) and गर्गमिच्छति आत्मनः (III. I. 9) = रथकट्य and गर्गकाम्य ॥ Here also before the क् of the affix, the अ should be replaced by इ, when the feminine affix आ is added: for there is no intervention between क् and आ (the intermediate letters being non-existent, as you say). Answer: We say that intervention is no intervention, when it consists of only one letter, which even does not actually exist, but only through the fiction of _sthanivat_. Therefore, the feminine of the above words will not take इ, as क् is not followed immediately (in the sense above expressed) by आप्, as रथकट्या and गर्गकाम्या, because in these actually many letters are heard as intervening between the क् and आप् ॥\n\nWhy do we say असुप्ः 'provided that the feminine affix आप् does not come after a case-affix? Observe बहवः परिव्राजका अस्यां मथुरायां = बहुपरिव्राजका मथुरा ॥ Here आप् comes after the noun बहुपरिव्राजक which ends in a case-affix, and hence the अ of ज is not changed to इ ॥ The case-affix is elided by (II. 4. 71), and it still exerts its influence by (I. 1. 62). The word असुपः is a प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधः (a simple prohibition of the particular matter specified without mentioning what is different from it): and not a पर्युदासः or exception. Had it been a _Paryudasa_, (सुपोऽन्यः = असुपः) then आप् coming after a full word not having a case-affix, would have caused the इ substitution in the last example. Nor should असुपः be explained as that in which there exists no case-affix. Had it been so, then in बहूनि चर्माण्यस्यां = बहुचर्मिका not इ ought to be added.\n\nVart:- मामक and नरक should be enumerated, for the क् of these is not part of the affix: as मामिका, नरिका ॥ Here ममक् is substituted for मम before the affix अण् (IV. 3. 3), to which is then added टाप् ॥ The word ममक takes long ई in the feminine only when it is a Name or in the _Vedas_ (IV. 1. 30): therefore though मामक ends in अण्, it does not take ङीप् (IV. 1. 15) but टाप् (IV. I. 4), नराम् कायति = नरक formed with the affix क (अ (III. 2. 3)).\n\nVart:- The rule applies to the words ending in त्यक् (IV. 2. 98) and त्यप्, (IV. 2. 104) in spite of the prohibition in (VII. 3. 46). As दाक्षिणात्यिका, इहत्यिका ॥\n\nThe word in the _sutra_ is कात् the fifth case of क ending in अ ॥ If then this be the condition, that the affix must end in _ka_ क and not in _k_ क्, then the rule will not apply to एतिका ॥ Because here the augment is अकच् (अक्) with क्; the final अ in अकच् is for euphony only, and not a portion of the affix, as we find in भिन्धकि, छिन्धकि, रुन्धकि ॥ The word कात therefore, is construed to mean ending in the consonant क ॥",
    "73045": "As यका सका ॥ The या and सा simply stand for यद् and तद्, and the prohibition is not confined to the nominative case only, as the forms या and सा may lead one to think. न यत् तदोः would have been a better _sutra_. The prohibition applies in every case, as यकामधीते, तकां पचामहे ॥ Or यकांयकामधीमहे (i.e. ऋचां गाथां च), and तकां तकाम्पचामहे (i. e. औषधीं शाकिनीं वा)\n\nVart:- The affix त्यकन् (V. 3. 34) should be enumerated also along with यत् and तद् ॥ As उपत्यका, अधित्यका ॥\n\nVart:- The feminine of पावक &c in the _Veda_ does not take इ for अ ॥ As हिरण्यवर्णः शुचयः पावकाः, यासु अ लोमकाः, ऋक्षकाः &c. But पाविकाः, अलामिकाः in secular literature.\n\nVart:- So also in the affix वुन् used in benediction: as जीवताद् जीवका, नन्दताद् नन्दका, भवताद् भवका ॥ See (III. I. 150).\n\nVart:- So also when the second member is elided in a compound: as देवका, यज्ञका, the second member दत्त is elided, the fuller forms being देवदत्तिका, यज्ञदत्तिका (अनजादौ च विभाषा लोपो वक्तव्यः) See (V. 3. 83) _Vartika_.\n\nVart:- क्षिपक &c should be enumerated in this prohibition : as क्षिपका, ध्रुवका, धुवका, चटका ॥\n\nVart:- तारका is formed when it means 'stars', but तारिका 'a maid-servant' from तारयति ॥  \n\nVart:- वर्णका is formed when it means 'a mantle or mask', but वर्णिका 'an expounder': as वर्णिका भागुरी लोकायते '_Bhaguri_ is a commentary of _Lokayata_'\n\nVart:- वर्तका 'a bird' according to the Eastern grammarians, but वर्तिका according to the Northern authorities. Why do we say 'when meaning a bird'? 'Observe वर्त्तिका भागुरी लोकायतस्य ॥\n\nVart:- अष्टका when meaning a पितृदैवत्य ceremony, but अष्टिका खारी ॥ The ceremony related to _Pitridevata_ is called _Pitridaivatya_, the affix is यत् ॥ The former is derived from the root अश् with the affix तकन् (अश्नन्ति ब्राह्मणा ओदनमस्यां), the other is derived from the numeral अष्ट by the affix कन् (V. I. 22).\n\nVart:- Optionally सूतका, पुत्रका and वृन्दारका, the other forms are सूतिका, पुत्रिका, and वृन्दारिका ॥",
    "73046": "The mention of 'northern grammarians' makes this an optional rule. As इभ्यका or इभ्यिका, क्षत्रियका or क्षत्रियिका, चटकका or चटकिका, मूषिकका, मूषिकिका ॥ Why do we say preceded by य् or क् ? Observe अश्वक-अश्विका only (from अश्वा) ॥ The word यकपूर्वायाः is exhibited in the feminine, in order to indicate that the rule applies when the feminine affix आ is shortened to अ ॥ Therefore not here शुभंयिका from शुभंया (शुभं याति). So also भद्रंयिका from भद्रया, where आ is part of the root या (see (III. 2. 74)).\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the य् and क् being finals of a root. When the य् or क् preceding this अ, is the final of the root, the prohibition contained in the _sutra_, does not apply: as सुनयिका, सुशयिका, and अशोकिका ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of long आ'? Observe सांकाश्ये भवा = सांकाश्यिका ॥ The word संकाश्य is formed from संकाश by the affix ण्य (संकाशे निर्वृत्तं) ॥ Then is added the affix वुञ् (IV. 2. 121). Here there is no shortening of a long आ, and hence no option is allowed. But in इभ्यका or इभ्यिका the long आ has been shortened. Because this word is thus derived: इभमर्हति = इभ्या (दण्डादिभ्योयः (V. I. 66)). To this क is added, and the long आ is shortened.\n\nWhy is the word स्थान used in the _sutra_, when by the general rule षष्ठी स्थाने योगः this word would be understood here? The special mention is for the sake of pointing out that the अ which takes the place of आ is intended here: i. e. the इ replaces this short अ; but had the word स्थाने not been used in the _sutra_ the इ would have replaced the long आ ॥",
    "73047": "As भस्त्रका or भस्त्रिका, अभस्त्रका or अभस्त्रिका, एषका or एषिका, अजका or अजिका, ज्ञका or ज्ञिका, अज्ञका or अज्ञिका, द्वके or द्विके, स्वका or स्विका, अस्वका or अस्विका ॥ Of एषा and द्वि there are no examples with the negative particle. For if the compounding with नञ् takes place after the addition of the अकच्, or on the contrary, if first अकच् be added and then the नञ् compounding takes place, in both alternatives, the case-affixes must be added in order to substitute अ for the final by (VII. 2. 102): and it is only when this अ is substituted that the feminine टाप् can come. So that the case-affix is the principal ingredient, and टाप् comes after सुप्, and therefore by the prohibition of असुपः in (VII. 3. 44), there can arise no occasion for the substitution of इ ॥ Therefore अनेषका and अंद्वके are the invariable forms of these words with the negative particle. स्व meaning agnates and property, takes the negative particle. भस्त्रा is a word which has no corresponding masculine form, and as such, by the following rule (VII. 3. 48) it would not have taken इ; its special mention here indicates that it should be the secondary member of the compound here: as अविद्यमाना भस्त्रा यस्या = अभस्त्रा, the Diminutive of which is अभस्त्रका or अभस्त्रिका ॥ Here first the भस्त्रा is shortened as it is a secondary member (_upasarjana_), then when the _Bahuvrihi_ is made, the feminine affix टाप् is added to this भाषितपुंस्क word, then this आ is shortened before क by (VII. 4. 13). This short अ (VII. 4. 13) does not come in the room of the आ which is ordained to come after a word having no corresponding masculine.\n\nThe force of अपि shows that the rule applies, when words other than नञ् also precede, and even when no words precede. As निर्भस्त्रिका or निर्भस्त्रका, बहुभस्त्रिका or बहुभस्त्रका ॥\n\nNote: The form द्वके is from the word द्वकि, dual number, the final इ is changed to अ (त्यदाद्यत्व), then the feminine आ (टाप्) is added (द्वका), and then शी is substituted for औ ॥",
    "73048": "As खट्वका or खट्विका, अखट्विका or अखट्वका, परमखट्वका or परमखट्विका ॥ When before the affix कप्, the stem is shortened in a _Bahuvrihi_, this rule will apply (VII. 4. 15). There also, the अ must be substituted for the आ of a feminine word which has no corresponding masculine. But this rule does not apply when the negative compound is the synthesis of अविद्यमाना खट्वा अस्याः = अखट्वा, अल्पा अखट्वा =अखट्विका ॥ Similarly अतिक्रान्ता खट्वाम् = अतिखट्वा, अल्पा अतिखट्वा =अतिखट्विका ॥\n\nNote: The word खट्वा is always feminine and has no corresponding masculine.",
    "73049": "As खट्वाका, अखट्वाका or परमखट्वाका ॥\n\nNote: The \"Teachers\" referred to here are either those other than the Northern Grammarians, or it may refer to the Teacher of _Panini_, the plural being for the sake of respect. Thus there are three forms अखट्वका, अखट्विका, and अखट्वाका ॥",
    "73050": "As आक्षिकः, शालाकिकः (ठक् (IV. 4. 1)), लावणिकः (ठञ् (IV. 4. 52)). In the affixes ठक्, ठञ् &c, if the affix is the consonant ठ्, and अ is only for euphony, then here also the अ is for pronunciation only: but if on the contrary, the aggregate ठ (ठ् + अ) is the affix, then the same is the case here. This rule does not apply in _Unadi_ affixes always, as कणेष् ठः = कण्ठः (_Unadi_ l. 103), for there is diversity (बहुल) in the _Unadi_.\n\nमाथितिकः (= मथितं पण्यमस्य (IV. 4. 51)) is thus formed मथित + ठक् = मथित् + इक (VI. 4. 148) theअ is dropped)). Now arises the doubt, should इक be replaced by क as taught in the next aphorism (VII. 3. 51), as it comes after a त् ॥ This substitution, however, does not take place, because it was इक् which caused the elision of अ, and now त् which became final by such elision cannot cause the destruction of इक its producer (सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य). Or the elided अ (VI. 4. 148) may be considered as _sthanivat_, and would thus prevent क substitution.\n\nThere are two views about this ठ ॥ Some say that the consonant ठ् only is the _sthani_, and the अ is only for the sake of pronunciation. The others hold that ठ, the consonant and the vowel are _sthani_ in the aggregate. In the first view, the rule would apply to the consonant ठ् at the end of roots like पठ् in पठिता, पठितुं; in the other view the rule would apply to the affix अठच् in कर्मठः ॥  Hence, the commentary uses the word, that ठ must be the cause of अङ्ग ॥",
    "73051": "As सार्पिष्कः, धानुष्कः, याजुष्कः, नैषादकर्षुकः, शाम्बरजम्बुकः, मातृकम्, पैतृकम्, औदश्वित्कः, शाकृत्कः, याकृत्कः ॥ The इस् and उस् are the affixes of that name, therefore not here, आशिषिकः (= आशिषा चरति), औषिका (= उषा चरति) ॥\n\nVart:- So also after दोष, as दौष्कः (दोर्भ्यां चरति) ॥\n\nThe word सार्पिष्कः is formed by ठक् of तदस्य पण्यं, (IV. 4. 51) and स is changed to ष by इणः षः (VIII. 3. 39). भानुष्कः is by ठक् of प्रहरणं ॥ याजुष्क is by ठक् of दीव्यति ॥ नैषादकर्षुकः &c by ठञ् of भवादावर्थे ओर्देशे ठञ् ॥ मातृकः by ठञ् of तत आगतः, ऋतष्ठञ् ॥ औदाश्वत्कः by ठक् (IV. 2. 19) शाकृत्कः by ठञ् of संसृष्टे (IV. 4. 12).",

(4 and 5) दूरेपाकः, फलेपाकः formed by the अच् affix of पचादि class, (= दूरे पच्यते स्वयमेव, फले पच्यते स्वयमेव) ॥ The _vriddhi_ is by _nipatana_.

Otherwise the substitute would replace the final letter. Why of हन् ? Observe प्रहारः, प्रहारकः ॥ ण् and ञ् qualify the affixes, and न् means the न् of हन् which becomes joined with ह् when the intermediate अ is dropped. This न् comes in immediate contact with ह, because it is heard in pronouncing, and in writing. If the elided अ be considered as _sthanivat_, then ह can never be followed by न्, for there will exist the intervention of this latent अ, but by virtue of the special text of this _sutra_, such an elided अ should not be considered as an intervention. And if ञ्, ण् and न् be all considered as qualifying the ह् of हन्, still on the maxim ये न नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात् therefore ण् or ञ् are considered to come after ह् though a portion of the root intervenes.

Objection: The word अचङि could be dispensed with from the _sutra_, in as much as चङ् can never come after the simple root हि, but after the causative of हि, and the causative stem of हि is a different verb than, हि. Answer: The fact of this word अचङि being employed in the _sutra_ indicates the existence of the following maxim: प्रकृतिग्रहणे ण्यधिकस्यापि ग्रहणम् \"A radical denotes whenever it is employed in Grammar, not only that radical itself, but it denotes also whatever stem may result from the addition to it of the causative affix णि\" ॥ Therefore we have प्रजिघाययिषति ॥\n\nThe word प्राजीहयत् is the Aorist of the causative of हि, with चङ्, the elision of णि, the shortening of the penultimate the reduplication, guttural change by कुहोश्चु, and lengthening by दीर्घोलघोः ॥",

But also यदग्निरग्नये ददात् ॥ The form ददात्, however, may also be deduced even when the final of  दा is elided, for then by the आट् augment (III. 4. 94) we get this form. The word वा is therefore employed in the _sutra_ only for the sake of distinctness, for the _sutra_ without वा would have also given the above forms, as we have shown. Or the वा is used to remove the doubt which one may entertain to this effect \" ददात् is the form which may be deduced by the general rule, since लोप is taught, this form will be excluded altogether and will never appear\".\n\nThe form दधत् is thus evolved. We add तिप् to the root धा; then the इ of ति is elided (III. 4. 97). दाशुषे = यजमानाय रत्नानि दद्यात् ॥ Others say, the दधत् is the form of the root with the शतृ affix. ददत् is from the root दाञ् ॥\n\nSome say that वा is _jnapaka_ and indicates the existence of the following maxim :- अनित्यमागमशासनम् \"the rule about augments is _anitya_\".

For लोप would have elided only the final अ of स ॥ But even with the elision of अ alone we would have got all the above forms, except those in वहि ॥ For अ being elided, we have स् between ह् (a consonant of झल् class) and a dental (which is also a letter of झल् class). This स् situate between two झल् will be elided by (VIII. 2. 26). Nor can it be objected that the elided अ is _sthanivat_, for by पूर्वत्रासिद्धं (VIII. 2. 1), such an elision cannot be _sthanivat_. Though व् is a dento-labial, yet it is included in the word dental. Had it not been meant to be so included, तौ (letters of त class) would have been taken in the _sutra_. See (III.

For when हि is elided by लुक्, (VI. 4. 105) then by (I. 1. 63), the affix being dropped by a लु-elision, it would produce no effect and so there ought to have been no lengthening? This is no valid objection. The prohibition of (l. I. 63), applies to the अङ्ग stem after which the affix is elided. Here क्रम् is not a stem or _anga_ with regard to हि, but it is a stem with regard to शप्, as क्रम् + शप् + हि ॥ Therefore, though हि is elided, the lengthening will take place by (I. 1. 62), (प्रत्यय लक्षणम्) ॥",

Those who do not read the _sutra_ as इषु &c, but as इषगमि &c, read the _anuvritti_ of the word अचि from (VII. 3. 72) into this _sutra_; so that the शित् is qualified by the word अच्, i.e. a शित् affix which is merely a vowel, and has no consonant in it; (and not a शित् affix which begins with a vowel). Therefore though शानच् is a शित् affix beginning with a vowel, yet as it contains a consonant, the छ substitution does not take place, as इषाणः (III. 1. 83) The reading of the text according to _Patanjali_ and _Katyayana_ is इषगमियमां छ, and hence the necessity of the above explanation. The reading इषु, though convenient, is not _arsha_.",

Or the substitute पिब is one which ends with अ, and is acutely accented on the first. It must be acutely accented on the first; otherwise by (VI. 1. 162), the acute will be on the last पिब꣡ ॥ Then when there is _ekadesa_ with शप्, the acute will be on the middle in पिब꣡ति, which is not desired. धौ is substituted for सृ when the sense is 'to run, move quickly'; in any other sense, we have प्रसरति, अनुसरति ॥",

Why जा (long) and not ज, for this ज would assume the form जा by (VII. 3. 101)? This long आ of जा indicates the existence of the maxim given above in (VII. 3. 78); and had ज been the substitute, (VII. 3. 101), could not have lengthened it.",

Thus पुनाति, लुणाति, स्तृणाति ॥ Those who hold that _Pvadi_ roots are upto the end of the Class, explain the non-shortening of जानाति (for ज्ञा would also then become _Pvadi_), by saying that the express text of (VII. 3. 79), substituting long जा prevents the shortening. They say had ज्ञा been also shortened, then merely ज substitute would have been enough and not जा; and this ज would have been lengthened in the case of जन् by (VII. 3. 101), to form जायते ॥",

The _Bhvadi_ मिद् will get _guna_ before शप् by virtue of (VII. 3. 86), but the _Divadi_ मिद् would not have got _guna_ before श्यन्, as this affix is ङित् (I. 2. 4): hence the necessity of this _sutra_. Before non शित् affixes there is no _guna_, as मिद्यते, मेमिद्यते ॥",

As चिन्युः, सुनुयुः ॥ Here there are two ङित् affixes, the augment यासुट्, and the _sarvadhatuka_ जुस्; and the यासुट् prevents _guna_. The इक् is read into the _sutra_ from (I. I. 3).",

When this _guna_ is substituted, there does not take effect that rule, which causes _Vriddhi_ of the penultimate short अ of जागर; (अत उपधायाः (VII. 2. 116)). Had that been the case, then the _guna_ substitution would become simply useless, and the prohibition with regard to चिण् and णल् superfluous. Why do we say not before वि, चिण् and णल् and ङित्? Observe जागविः (with the affix विन् _Unadi_) अजागारि with चिण् which causes _Vriddhi_, and अजागार with णल्, and जागृतः and जागृथः with a ङित् (I. 2. 4) affix. Some hold that the इ in वि is for the sake of pronunciation only, and the prohibition applies to all affixes beginning with a व, such as कसु, as जजागृवान्, here there is no _guna_. In अजागरुः with जुस् the _guna_ takes place by virtue of (VII. 3. 83): for though it is a ङित् affix also, the prohibition ङितसु of this _sutra_ does not affect it. Similarly अहं जजागर with णल् the optional _guna_ (VII. 1. 91) is also not prohibited by the णल् of this _sutra_. In fact the phrase अविचिण् णल् ङितसु is a _Paryudasa_ prohibition : for had it been a _prasayya_-_pratishedha_, then the _guna_ before जुस् and the Ist Person णल् would also have been prohibited. In short this _sutra_ positively ordains _guna_ of जागृ before every affix, other than वि, चिण्, णल् and ङित्, and if by any other rule these latter would cause _guna_, that _guna_ is not prohibited. That is the result of _Paryudasa_ negation.\n\nBut if the _sutra_ be construed as a _Prasayyapratishedha_, then we shall apply the maxim अनन्तरस्य विधिर्वा भवति प्रतिषेधो वा ॥ The prohibition is therefore stated with regard to जाग्र in connection with the affixes वि, चिण्, णल् and ङित् ॥ But the _guna_ ordained by (VII. 3. 84), (VII. 3. 83) is not prohibited.",

Thus भिद् + तृ, though द् + तृ = त्तृ  causes the इ to become heavy, that will not prevent _guna_: for विध्यपेक्षं लघुग्रहणम् ॥ Objection : If this be so, why the forms कुण्डितृ, हुण्डितृ are not incorrect, for in them also the vowel is _laghu_ (the roots are कुड् and हुड्), and the augment म् is added afterwards by a _Vidhi_ rule? Answer: The augment म् is added to the root, and becomes _upadesivat_. (See (VII. 1. 58)). Objection: If so, how do you cause _Vriddhi_ in रञ्ज्, as in रागः with घञ्; as रञ्ज् + घञ् = रज् + घञ् (the ञ् being dropped by (VI. 4. 27)), for it is after the elision of ञ्, that the of रज् becomes penultimate and can admit of _Vriddhi_ by (VII. 2. 116)? Answer: The exceptional forms स्यदः from स्यन्द् + घञ्, and श्रथः from श्रन्थ + घञ्, taught in (Vl. 4. 28); (VI. 4. 29) teach by implication that roots of this form take _Vriddhi_ as a general rule. Objection: If the विध्यपेक्ष maxim is not of universal application: though by (VI. 4. 134), the अ of अन् &c. is elided in _bha_ stems, like राजन् thus राज्ञा; yet the अ shoud not be elided if you be consistent, in आनङ् augment added by (VII. 1. 75) to दधि, अस्थि &c. In fact, you could not get the forms दध्ना सक्थ्ना &c. Moreover though there can be the lengthening of the penultimate in सामन् = सामानि (before शि affix Nominative Plural), yet not in the case of कुण्डानि from कुण्ड for here न् is added by another rule (VII. 1. 72). If you say, the maxim is not of universal application, then there can be no _guna_ of इ in भिद् to form भेत्तृ ॥ Answer: The _guna_ takes place in forms like भेत्तृ &c, because the prohibition of the following rule (VII. 3. 87), with regard to the affixes beginning with a vowel, proves by implication that before affixes beginning with a consonant, as तृ, the _guna_ also takes place. Objection: The prohibition in the case of vowel beginning affixes is for the sake of लङ्, to form अनेनेक् ॥ This is derived from निजिर् (_Juhotyadi_ 11), in the Imperfect, as अ + निज् + शप्श्लु + तिप् then reduplication (VI. I. 10), then _guna_ of the reduplicate, (VII. 4. 75), then तिप् which had become त in the Imperfect, is elided by (VI. 1. 68). Thus अनिज् + श्लु + त् = अ + निनिज् + त् (VI. 1. 10) = अ नेनिज् + त् (VII. 4. 75) = अ नेनिज् (VI. 1. 98) = अननक्. The elided त् produces its effect, the _guna_ by (VII. 3. 86). This is why अच् is taken in _sutra_ (VII. 3. 87), namely अजादि affixes do not cause _guna_, the हलादि affixes like त् cause _guna_. You cannot therefore say that अचि in (VII. 3. 87) is a _jnapaka_. Answer: The _sutra_ त्रसिगृधिधृषिक्षिपेः क्नुः (III. 2. 140) teaches the addition of नु to त्रस् &c, as गृध्नुः; if this नु had not tended to cause the _guna_ of the penultimate vowels of these roots, what was the necessity of making this affix a कित्? Similarly (I. 2. 10) teaches that सन् (Desiderative) is कित् after roots ending in consonants. These rules show that words like भत &c get _guna_, and the final consonant of the root plus the initial consonant of the affix, does not make the root vowel heavy. Objection: The कित् of सन् is for the sake of the elision of the nasal, in धिप्सति, धाप्सति (VI. 4. 24). Answer: Let it be so: still the कित् of क्नु is enough for us.\n\nThe \"_upadha_ short\" must be the vowels of the इक् _pratyahara_. Therefore in भिनत्ति, the penultimate is short अ (of श्नम्) and it does not take _guna_. In fact, the word penultimate qualifies the word इक् understood. Others explain it by saying that पुगन्त is to be analysed by पुकि अन्त \"in the vicinity of प्\" ॥ The word अन्त means समीप, and means the इक् vowel in the proximity of पुक् ॥ The word लघूपधा should be analysed as लघ्वी उपधा and is a _Karmadharaya_ compound, and means \"a short or light penultimate\".

The form तृणेक्षि is similarly formed by (VIII. 2. 41), the ढ् being changed to क before सि of सिप् ॥ अतृणेट् is the लङ् 2nd and 3rd Person Singular.",

Thus उत्तौति or उत्तवीति, उपरौति or उपरवीति, उपस्तौति or उपस्तवीति, शाम्यध्वम् or शमीध्वम्, अभ्यमति or अभ्यमीति ॥ शम् and अम् can then be followed by a consonant beginning _sarvadhatuka_ affix, when they lose their Present character (_vikarana_) as a Vedic anomaly (_bahulam_ _chhandasi_).\n\nThe _Apisalas_ read the _sutra_ as तुरुस्तुशम्यमः सार्वधातुकासुच्छन्दसि ॥ This will then become a विधि rule for the Vedic forms. The word सार्वधातुका is here exhibited in the feminine.\n\nThe repetition of '_sarvadhatuka_', though its _anuvritti_ was present is for the sake of stopping the _anuvritti_ of पित्, and this rule applies to अपित् affixes also, as सुवीत, शमाध्वम् ॥",

To भू is added क्वसु, then comes शप्, treating _kvasu_ as a _sarvadhatuka_ under (III. 4. 117); the reduplication of the root ending in शप् is prevented, because the word _dhatu_ is used in (VI. 1. 8) which ordains reduplication of a root only, and not of a root plus a _vikarana_ like the form भव (भू + शप्) ॥ Those who do not read the _anuvritti_ of तिङ् in this _sutra_, but only of the word सार्वधातुके, they explain the form भववान् as a Vedic anomaly.",

Why do we say \"not in the Feminine?\" Observe कृत्या, धेन्वा ॥",
    "74001": "As अचीकरत्, अजीहरत्, अलीलवत्, अपीपठत् ॥ Here the rules of reduplication and shortening of the penultimate both present themselves simultaneously. The rule about shortening, being subsequent in order, is applied first, and then the reduplication takes place. Thus कारि + अत् = कार् + अत् (णि being elided (VI. 4. 51)) = कर् + अत् (shortening (VII. 4. 1)) = चकर् + अत् (VI. 1. 11) = चिकर् + अत् (VII. 4. 93), (VII. 4. 79) = चीकरत् (VII. 4. 94). The necessity of maintaining this order will appear from the following considerations. The Causative stem of अट् is आटि; the Aorist of which is आटि + चङ् + त् = आट् + अत् (VI. 4. 51). Now if reduplication took place first we shall have आटिट् + अत् (I. 1. 59) the elided इ will be present for the purposes of reduplication) and as the penultimate is short already, the form will be आटिटत्, which with the augment अ will be अ + आटिटत् = आटिटत् ॥ This is a correct form, so far as it goes; but when the augment is elided in connection with the negative मा, the form will be मा भवान् आटिटत्, the correct form however is मा भवान् अटिटत् with a short अ, which can be formed if we shorten first and then reduplicate, as आट् + अत् = अट् + अत् = अटिट् + अत् = अटिटत्, which with the augment अ, will be आटिटत् ॥ In fact, though the reduplication of the second syllable (VI. 1. 2) is a _nitya_ rule, because it applies even where a penultimate is shortened and where not, yet the rule about shortening takes effect first, because the author has himself indicated this, by making the root ओण have an indicatory ऋ in the _Dhatupatha_ (See (VII. 4. 2) about ऋदित् verbs). For had the reduplication taken place first in the case of ओण् (_Bhuadi_. 482), as ओणिण्, there would be no long vowel to be shortened, and there would be no necessity of the probibition (VII. 4. 2).\n\nObjection: Why do we say 'in the Causative'? The चङ् Aorist is formed of Causatives only (See (III. I. 48)), the only exceptions being the simple roots श्रि, ब्रु, सु, धेट् and श्वि, none of which have any vowel in the penultimate and कम् and सुप् have already short _upadha_. The _sutra_ चङ्युपधाया ह्रस्वः would have been enough. Answer: Had the _sutra_ been, as proposed, then it would have meant, 'that which is penultimate when चङ् follows, should be shortened'. Therefore in the Aorist of the Causative of लू, we have लू + णि + चङ् + त् = लू + इ + अत् here the penultimate with regard to चङ् is ऊ, which would be shortened; debarring _Vriddhi_ and आव् substitute, and there would have come the उवङ् substitute instead. But that is not the case. We have अलीलवत्, and not अलुलुवत् ॥ Similarly, in the Aorist of the Causative of दा, we shall have दा + इ + अत्, and आ being shortened we have द + इ + अत, so that we cannot add the augment पुक् (VII. 3. 36), and form अदीदपत् ॥ And the forms like अपीपचत् (पच् + इ + अत्) would not at all admit of shortening.\n\nWhy do we say when चङ् follows ? Observe कारयति, हारयति where there is no shortening in the Present Tense. Why do we say of the penultimate? Observe अचकाङ्क्षत् from काङ्क्ष्, and अववाञ्छत् from वाञ्छ, where the penultimate being a consonant, there can be no shortening. Had the word penultimate been not used, the vowels of these would be shortened. And the word '_upadha_' is also absolutely necessary for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ like (VII. 4. 4), and it prevents shortening in the above case, which would have otherwise taken place, on the maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात् which qualifies (I. 1. 67).\n\nVart:- The rule of shortening of the penultimate applies to the चङ् Aorist of the Causative of the Causative i. e. to the double Causative even. Thus अवीवदत् (= वादितवन्तं प्रयोजितवान्) वीणां परिवादकेन ॥ Otherwise वादि + इ + अत् = वाद् + इ + अत् = वाद् + ० + अत् ॥ Here the elided इ being _sthanivat_, will prevent shortening, or because the stem has lost a simple-vowel (अग्लोपिन्), it will not be shortened. The present _vartika_ makes it so however.",
    "74002": "The word अग्लोपिन् means literally a stem, in which a simple vowel (अक् _pratyahara_) or a portion containing an अक् vowel has been dropped. As the final vowels of Denominative stems are so elided before the Causative sign णि, the _sutra_ has been translated accordingly. Thus अममालत् = मालामाख्यत्; अममातरत् = मातरमाख्यत्, अत्यरराजत् = राजानमतिक्रान्तवान्, अन्वलुलामत् = लोमान्यनुमृष्टवान् ॥ Where a simple अक् vowel alone is elided, as in the case of माला, there the elided आ being _sthanivat_, would prevent the shortening, the आ of मा not being then considered penultimate. So that अग्लोपिन् could be spared from the _sutra_, since the _sthanivad_-_bhava_ would prevent shortening. But where an अक् vowel plus a consonant is dropped, as in राजन् and लोमन्, there the _sthanivad_-_bhava_ does not apply (I. I. 57), hence the necessity of employing the term अग्लोपिन् in the _sutra_. Similarly अशशासत् with शास्; and अबबाधत् from बाधृ, अययाचत् from याचृ, and अडुढौकत् from ढौकृ ॥ See (III. I. 21) and (III 1. 25).",

Thus अपीप्यत्, अपीप्यताम्, अपीप्यन् ॥ When the penultimate आ is elided, there remains प् which cannot be reduplicated as having no vowel, but the elided आ is considered as _sthanivat_ and thus पा is reduplicated. _Sutra_ (VII. 4. 80) establishes by implication the principle that the substitutes caused by णि are _sthanivat_. Thus भू + णि = भावि; in reduplicating, this भा will not be reduplicated, but भू, as बुभावि, भा = भू by _sthanivad_-_bhava_.",

I. 5). But this does not debar the _Vriddhi_ caused by णल् (VII. I. 115). In fact, that prior rule supersedes this posterior rule, as सस्वार, दध्वार, सस्मार ॥ The word लिटि is to be supplied in the _sutra_, the rule does not apply to _Nishtha_ &c., as स्मृतः, स्मृतवान् ॥\n\nVart:- For the sake of कृञ्, the _guna_ should be stated even where the double-consonant is in the penultimate position and not in the beginning.

On the maxim पूर्वं धातुः साधनेन युज्यते पश्चादुपसर्गेण 'a root is first developed fully and then the preposition is added to it'; we first develop कृ in the Perfect by reduplication, which gives us चकृ + अतुस्, then we add the preposition as संचकृ + अतुः, then we add सुट् though the reduplicate intervenes, by (VI. I. 136) and (VI. I. 137), as संचस्कृ + अतुः, now the root assumes a form in which the penultimate begins with a double consonant, and applying the _vartika_ we make _guna_, and get संचस्करतुः ॥\n\nIt is by this consideration that in संस्कृषीष्ट, उपस्कृषीष्ट, the सुट् augment being _Bahiranga_ and consequently considered as non-existent (_asiddha_), there\nis no इट् augment added by (VII. 2. 43).",

The _Vriddhi_ of (VII. 2. 115) supersedes this rule, within its own jurisdiction, a prior superseding the posterior: as निचकार, नि जगार ॥",

The word 'short' is used in the _sutra_, in order to debar the इर् and उर् alternatives. Had the _sutra_ been \"शॄ दॄ प्रां वा\" the alternative examples would have been with इर् (VII. 1. 101) as शिशिरतुः दिदिरतुः and उर् (VIII. 2. 77) as पिपुरतुः ॥ Some say this _sutra_ is unnecessary. The above forms like वि शश्रतुः, विशश्रुः, &c. can be regularly obtained from the roots श्रा 'to cook', द्रा 'to abuse', and प्रा 'to fill' and as the roots have many other senses, besides those assigned to them in the _Dhatupatha_, the roots श्रा, द्रा and प्रा will give the meanings of शॄ, दॄ and पॄ ॥ If that were so, the form विशशृवान् with the affix क्वसु could not be formed, for we should have either विशशर्वान् from शॄ root or विशश्रिवान् from श्रा root but never विशशृवान् ॥ So the rule about shortening is necessary.",

Therefore, the very existence of this _sutra_ debars every sort of shortening. Objection: The present _sutra_ would not be useless, for it will find scope where there is no shortening of the _upasarjana_ by (I. 2. 48): namely before non-feminine affixes, as बहुयवागूकः; but there should be shortening in feminine affixes.  Answer: The shortening of (I. 2. 48) will not take place before कप् affix. Because the कप् affix will first be added to the second member in the sense of the compound, and then the word so ending in कप् will be compounded with the first member. So there is no _pratipadika_ left which ends in a feminine affix, and therefore (I. 2. 48), does not apply, because the _pratipadika_ now left is one ending in the affix कप् and not in a feminine affix.",

    "74054": "The मी includes मीनाति (_Kryadi_ 4), and मिनोति (मि of _Svadi_ 4) for मि assumes the form मी by (VI. 4. 16).

As प्रति रित्सति ॥ Why do we say when the sense is that of 'to injure'? Observe आरि रात्सति ॥",
    "74055": "Thus आप्-ईप्सति, ज्ञपि-ज्ञीप्सति, ऋध्-ईर्त्सति (I. 1. 51). The reduplication is dropped by (VII. 4. 58). In the Causative stem ज्ञपि there are two vowels, the इ (णि) is dropped by _purva_-_vipratishedha_ (the prior debarring the subsequent) according to (VI. 4. 51), and ई (substituted for अ according to the present _sutra_. The word सन् is to be read into the _sutra_, otherwise प्रापस्यति ॥ The सन् must begin with स् i.e should not take the इट् augment, as in जिज्ञपयिषति, अर्हिधिषति ॥ The roots ज्ञपि and ऋध् are optionally सेट् in the Desiderative by (VII. 2. 49).",

The reduplication is elided by (VII. 4. 58).",
    "74058": "The examples are given under the above-mentioned _sutras_. The word 'of the reduplicate' अभ्यासस्य is to be supplied in all the subsequent _sutras_ upto the end of the chapter. Thus _Sutra_ (VII. 4. 59), says 'a short is to be substituted', we must supply the words 'for the reduplicate' to complete the sense: as डुढौकिषते, तुत्रौकिषते ॥ The word अत्र in the _sutra_ indicates that the reduplication is not to be elided, when an affix is treated like सन् but is not actually सन् ॥ Thus चङ्-Aorist is treated like सन् by (VII. 4. 93); but the reduplication will not be dropped there : as, अमीमपत्, अदीदपत् ॥ Some say the word अत्र here indicates that the whole of the reduplicate is dropped, and not only its final letter. Others elide the whole of the reduplicate on the maxim  नानर्थकोऽलोऽन्त्यविधिः ॥ \"The rule (I. I. 52), by which a substitute should take the place of only the final letter of that which is exhibited in the Genitive case, is not valid, where what is exhibited in the Genitive is meaningless\".",

See (VI. 1. 12) _Vartika_. This augment when added to the reduplicate, is not to be shortened by this rule: and because this is not to be shortened, also indicates that the consonants of the reduplicate other than the first are also not dropped: as चराचरः, चलाचलः, पतापतः, वदावदः ॥",
    "74060": "As जग्लौ, मम्लौ, पपाच, पपाठ, आट, आटतुः, आटुः ॥ This rule ordains the retention of the initial consonant, if any, and elision of the non-initials in the reduplicate. If the root begins with a vowel as अट्, there being no initial consonant, in अट् अट्, the ट् will be elided of course. The word हलादिः should not be construed as a Genitive _Tatpurusha_ 'first among the consonants', for then in अक्ष् + लिट् = अक्ष् अक्ष्, the ष् only would be elided, and क् retained.\n\nThe word शेषः or शिष्यते here means अवस्थाप्यते 'is retained'. The word हलादिः is not a compound. For had it been a compound, then if it is a _Karmadharaya_, the word आदिः should stand first ; if it be a Genitive compound then the first among compound consonants would be retained and we could not get the form आनक्ष from अक्ष. The word _abhyasa_ is to be taken in the sense of _jati_ or kind, i.e. in the _jati_ which is collectively called _abhyasa_, the consonant that stands first in respect to _abhyasa_, is retained, and not the consonant standing in any other portion of it. So that all consonants, where ever they may be situated in the body of an _abhyasa_, whether in the beginning or middle or end, are dropped, except one with which the _abhyasa_ begins. Thus if the _abhyasa_ begins with a simple consonant, it is retained; if it begins with a conjunct consonant, the first is only retained; and if the consonant or consonants are not in the beginning they are all dropped.\n\nOthers say, the word शेषः here means \"retention along with the cessation of others\". Therefore, though literally the word शेषः or retention appears to be the principal word in this _sutra_, yet as a matter of fact, it is secondary, because the injunction is not with regard to retention, but with regard to cessation. The rule is not \"Retain the first consonant\"; but \"Drop every consonant but the first, is there be a first consonant\". Or the _sutras_ 59 and 60, may be combined and read thus : ह्रस्वोऽहल् \"The _abhyasa_ becomes short and also without consonant\". आदिशेषः \"The first consonant is retained\". Or the _sutras_ may be divided thus :-\n\n(1) 'A short vowel is substituted in the _abhyasa_'.\n\n(2) 'The consonants of _abhyasa_ are all elided'.\n\n(3) The first is retained.\n\nThe _sutras_ 59 and 60 must be joined by _sandhi_ \"ह्रस्वोऽहलादिशेषः\", and then we shall be able to read an elided अ between ह्रस्वः and हल्, as if it was a compound of ह्रस्व and अहल् ॥",

(3) दर्धर्षि if it be a form of यङ् लुक्, there is no irregularity. (4) बोभूतु is from भू in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), Imperative, irregularly without _guna_. Question: There is no necessity of including this, because there would be no _guna_ regularly even under (VII. 3. 88)? Answer: The inclusion of बोभूतु is a _jnapaka_, indicating that in every other case, the _guna_ is not prohibited in the Intensive (यङ् लुक्), as बोभेति, बोभवीति (लट् with ईट् (VII. 3. 94)) (5) तेतिक्तं is from तिज् in the Intensive _yan_ _luk_, _atmanepada_ is irregular. Question: The यङ् is ङित् and therefore by _pratyaya_ _lakshana_ rule (I. 1. 62) read with (I. 3. 12), the यङ् लुक् will be _atmanepadi_, where is the necessity of reading this _nipatan_? Answer: The _atmanepada_ _nipatan_ is a _jnapaka_, that in the Intensive _yan_ _luk_ the _atmanepada_ affixes are not employed. (6) अलर्षि is from the root ॠ (इयर्ति), in Present, 2nd Person, the र् of _abhyasa_ is not elided, though required by (VII. 4. 60), and this र् is changed to ल irregularly. This form is found in the 3rd Person also, as अलर्त्ति दक्षः ॥ (7) आ पमीफणत् is from फण् with आ augment, and शतृ affix is added to यङ् लुक्, and in the reduplicate मी is added. (8) संसनिष्यदत् is from स्यन्द with the Preposition सम्, in the Intensive yan _luk_, with शतृ affix, नि being added in the _abhyasa_, the root स is changed to ष ॥ The Preposition सं is not absolutely necessary, with other Prepositions also we have this form, as आ तमिष्यदत् ॥ (9) करिक्रत् is from कृ (करोति), in the Intensive _yan_ _luk_, with शतृ, in the _abhyasa_ there is no palatal change (VII. 4. 62), and रि is added to the reduplicate. (10) कनिक्रदत् from क्रन्द् in the Aorist with अङ्, reduplication, there is no _chutva_ ( VII. 4. 62) of the reduplicate, and the augment नि is added.

(12) दविध्वतः from ध्वृ (ध्वरते) in the _yan_ _luk_, _satr_, plural number Nominative. The रि is added to the reduplicate, the ऋ is elided, दविध्वतः रश्मयः सूर्यस्य ॥ (13) दविद्युतम् is from _dyut_, _yan_ _luk_ with _satr_, there is no vocalisation of the reduplicate, with अ change and वि augment, (14) तरित्रतः from तृ (तरति) with _slu_, _satr_, genitive singular: and रि added to _abhyasa_.

In तन्तन्यते &c, the _anusvara_ is changed to न्, ङ् &c, by (VIII. 4. 58); the other forms तन्तन्यते तंतनीति, जंगम्यते, जंगमीति are derived by the following :-\n\nVart:- This _anusvara_ should be treated as if it was at the end of a _Pada_ or word.

The substitute does not replace the अ of the reduplicate. Why do we say 'of अ'? The substitute should not replace the final letter, which it otherwise would have done by (I. I. 52). The त् in उत् debars _guna_ (VII. 3. 86) in चंचूर्ति and पंफुलीति, for though उ is lengthened by (VIII. 2. 77), in चंचूर्ति, yet that lengthening is considered as non-existent or _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1) for the purposes of _Guna_ (VII. 3. 86).

The rule does not apply to roots ending in long ॠ as, चाकर्ति, चाकीर्तः, चाकिरति from कॄ ॥ The word ऋतः qualifies the word अङ्ग and not the word अभ्यास, for an _abhyasa_ is always short, so the त् in ऋत् would become meaningless if the word qualified reduplicate. Therefore कॄ ending in long ॠ does not get रि, र् and रि augments in the reduplicate.\n\n_Karika_:- He who can conjugate, in the Present tense, the _yan_-_luk_ Intensive of कॄ and of other roots ending in long ॠ, is considered by me to be a person who has attained to the right knowledge of the employment of the augments र्, री, रि &c: and he has obtained the right use of words.\n\nThe word किरति in the _Karika_ is illustrative of all roots like कॄ (किरति) ending in long ॠ ॥ चर्क्करीत is the name given to the यङ् लुक् form of the Intensive, by ancient grammarians. चर्क्करीतान्त means, therefore, a form ending in _yan_-_luk_. पचति is illustrative of लट् or Present tense.",
    "74093": "The words of this _sutra_ require a little detailed explanation. The word सन्वत् means \"like unto सन् or Desiderative\"; i. e. as the Desiderative is treated, so should the चङ् Aorist of the Causative. The words लघुनि and चङ्परे are both in the Locative case, but not in apposition with each other, but refer to different objects. लघुनि means 'when a light vowel follows', namely that reduplicate which is followed by the light root-vowel. The operations to be performed on such a reduplicate, in the चङ् Aorist, after the णि are the same, as on the reduplicate of the Desiderative. अन्-अक्-लोपे \"provided that a simple vowel of the _Pratyahara_ अक् has not been elided\". We read the word 'causative' into this _sutra_, because there can be no other root which will form चङ् Aorist. Causatives form such Aorist. (III. 1. 48), as well as the simple roots श्रि, द्रु and स्रु ॥ The words चङ्परे qualifies the word अङ्ग understood: that stem which is followed by चङ्; therefore, it refers to the Causative stem, and not to the simple roots _sri_, _dru_ and _sru_. The light vowel, therefore refers, to the light vowel of the Causative stem before चङ् ॥\n\nThe word अनग्लोपे is in apposition with चङ्परे ॥ Thus कम् + णिङ् (III. 1. 30) = अकाम् + इ + अत् (III. 1. 48) = अकाम् + अत् (VI. 4. 51) = अकम् + अत् (VII. 4. 1) = अचकम् + अत् (VI. 1. 11) = आचकम् + अत् ((VII. 4. 79) read with (VII. 4. 93)) = अचीकमत् (VII. 4. 94).\n\nThus (VII. 4. 79) teaches the substitution of  इ for अ in the reduplicate of the Desiderative. The same substitution will take place in the reduplicate of the Aorist: as अचीकरत्, अपीपचत् ॥ Thus by (VII. 4. 80), इ is substituted for the उ of the reduplicate in the Desiderative, the same will be the case in the reduplicate of the Aorist, as अपीपवत् and अलीलवत्, and अजीजवत् ॥ Thus by (VII. 4. 81), इ is optionally substituted for उ in the Desiderative reduplicate of स्रु &c, the same will hold good in the Aorist-reduplicate, as असिस्रवत् or अस्रुस्रवत्, अशिश्रवत् or अशुश्रवत्, अदिद्रवत् or अदुद्रवत्, अपिप्रवत् or अपुप्रवत्, अपिप्लवत् or अपुप्लवत्, अचिच्यवत् or अचुच्यवत् ॥ Why do we say 'having a light vowel'? Observe अततक्षत्, अररक्षत्, अजजागरत् ॥\n\nSome say, that in अजजागरत्, the syllable ग is light, and therefore, the _san_-_vat_ rule would apply : for a light vowel no where immediately follows a reduplicate; therefore, though a long syllable जा intervenes, yet the rule will apply, because of the express text. This reasoning is wrong. The maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेनव्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात् cannot be extended to cases like this. It applies only when the intervention consists of one letter and not of more than one. Objection: If so, how do you form अचिक्षणत् for here two letters क् and ष् (क्ष) intervene between the reduplicate and the light vowel. Answer: The author indicates by implication in (VII. 4. 95) that these roots like क्षण् do take इ in the reduplicate; for had it not been so, what was the necessity of making an exception in favor of roots like स्मृ, त्वर, स्तॄ, स्पश् in (VII. 4. 95). So that a conjunct consonant is not considered an intervention for the purposes of this rule. Therefore, स्मृ &c would have taken इ in the reduplicate by (VII. 4. 79), read with the present _sutra_, and so the _Acharya_ enjoins अ instead in (VII. 4. 95) with regard to these.\n\nWhy do we say 'when चङ् follows'? Observe अहं पपच ॥ Why do we use the word पर \"followed by\"? The rule would not apply when चङ् alone follows णि, as अचकमत् where कम् has taken चङ् under the _vartika_ कमेरुपसंख्यानम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when an अक् vowel has not been dropped'? Observe अचकथत् from the _Churadi_ root कथ which ends in अ, and this अ is elided by (VI. 4. 48). Objection: This _lopa_ being considered _sthanivat_, will prevent the application of the present rule, as there will be an intervention. Answer: We shall give another example, अददृषत् from दृषदमाख्यातवान् ॥ Here णिच् is added to दृषत् under the _Vartika_ तत्करोतितदाचष्टे, and the टि portion is elided by इष्टवद्भावः, here a vowel and a consonant have been elided, and so the _lopa_ is not _sthanivat_.\n\nIn the double causative Aorist अवीवदत् the present rule applies, though one णि has been elided. अवीवदत् = वादितवन्तं प्रयोजितवान् ॥ In fact, the elision of one णि when followed by another णि is not considered as an _ak_-_lopa_; the latter refers to the elision of any other vowel than णि ॥ Therefore we have अवीवदद् वीणां परिवादकेन ॥ In fact, this exception rests on the following _vartika_ सम्बद्भावदीर्घत्वे णे र्णिच्युपसंख्यानम् ॥\n\nThe _lopa_ of the reduplicate which takes place before सन् of the roots मी, मा &c (VII. 4. 54) does not, however, take place in चङ् Aorist. The analogy does not extend so far. In fact, the present _sutra_ teaches a रूपातिदेश, namely the form which a reduplicate has in Desiderative, will be the form in the Aorist. But as मी, मा &c have no reduplicate form in the Desiderative, the analogy stops. Therefore, we shall have अमीमपत् ॥ Moreover the word सन्वद् here means the operations that depend solely on सन् ॥ Now the total elision of the reduplicate by (VII. 4. 54) does not depend upon सन् alone, but upon the augment इस् also of (VII. 4. 54). But as there can be no इस् in the Aorist, so there will be no elision also. In fact, an _atidesa_ should be confined to general cases and not to particulars.",
    "74094": "Thus अचीकरत्, the इ (VII. 4. 79) is lengthened. Similarly अजीहरत्, अलीलवत्, अपीपवत् ॥ Why do we say which is prosodially light? Observe अबिभ्रजत् ॥ Why do we say when the vowel of the root is light? Observe अततक्षत्, अररक्षत् ॥ Why do we say in the reduplicated Aorist? Observe अहं पपच ॥ The word पर is understood here also, so the rule will not apply to simple roots as अचकमत् ॥ The words '_anaglope_' are to be read here, therefore not so in अचकथत् ॥",
    "74095": "Thus असस्मरत्, अददरत्, अतत्वरत्, अपप्रथत्, अमम्रदत्, अपस्पशत् ॥ This debars the इ which would have come under (VII. 4. 93). The short अ indicates that it is not to be lengthened by (VII. 4. 94), as अददरत् ॥",
    "74096": "Thus अववेष्टत् or अविवेष्टत्, अचचेष्टत् and अचिचेष्टत् ॥ In one alternative there is shortening of the reduplicate (VII. 4. 59), and after such shortening, there is अ substituted in the other alternative.",
    "74097": "As अजीगणत् or अजगणत् ॥ गण is a root which ends in अ, and this अ being elided by (VI. 4. 48) before the Causative णि, the rule (VII. 4. 93), does not apply to it, because there is an _ak_-_lopa_ here, so in the other alternative, it has its natural अ ॥",
    "81001": "This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. Whatever will be taught hereafter upto पदस्य (VIII. 1. 16) exclusive, there the phrase सर्वस्य द्वे should be supplied to complete the sense. Thus (VIII. 1. 4) teaches \"when the sense is that of 'always', and 'each'.\" Here the phrase 'the whole word is repeated' should be supplied to complete the sense. i. e. \"The whole word is repeated when the sense is that of always and each\". What is to be repeated? That which is most appropriate in sound and sense both. Thus one पचति becomes two, as पचति पचति 'he always cooks'. Similarly ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'.\n\nThe _sutra_ '_sarvasya_ _dve_', should not be confounded as meaning 'the word-form _sarva_ is doubled'. For then rules likes (VI. 1. 99), and (VI. 1. 100) will find no scope. The word _sarva_ has several meanings: (1) the totality of things (द्रव्यः) as सर्वस्वं ददाति, (2) the totality of modes (प्रकारः) सर्वान्नीनोभिक्षुः = सर्वप्रकारमन्नं भक्षयति; (3) the totality of members (अवयवः), as सर्वः पटोदग्धः ॥ In the present _sutra_, the word _sarva_ has this last sense: namely all the members of a word are doubled, no portion is omitted. The force of the genitive case in _sarvasya_, is that of _sthana_, i. e. in the room of the whole of the words like परि &c there is doubling. So one meaning of the _sutra_ is, that in the room of the one word, two are substituted. In making such substitution, we must have regard to the rule of nearness.\n\nAnother meaning of the _sutra_ however is, that it does not teach substitution but repetition or employment, not _adesa_, but _prayoga_. That is to say, one word is employed twice. In this sense, of course, there is no room left for finding out the proper substitute. The very word-form, पचति &c, is employed twice, i. e. is repeated twice or pronounced twice.\n\nThe word _sarvasya_ is employed in the _sutra_ for the sake of distinctness only. Otherwise, one may double only the last letter of a word by the rule of अलोऽन्तस्य, though that rule is not, strictly speaking, applicable to such cases.\n\nObjection:- The word पदस्य should be employed in the _sutra_, in order to prevent the application of the rule to _Samasa_ (compound), to _taddhitas_, and to _vakyas_ (sentences). Thus सप्तपर्णोऽष्टापदम् ॥ Here there is the sense of _vipsa_ with regard to seven leaves, and does not mean a tree having seven leaves. There ought to have been doubling; but it would not take place, if we take the word _padasya_ in the aphorism. Similarly द्विपदिकां ददाति, here also the sense is that of _vipsa_, and there ought to have been doubling, before the affixing of the _taddhita_ affix. So also in ग्रामे ग्रामे पानीयम् the sentence ग्रामे पानीयम् is not doubled, if we employ _padasya_. So the word _padasya_, should be employed in the _sutra_. Moreover, it would prevent our employing the word _padasya_ again in (VIII. 1. 16).\n\nAnswer:- We could not employ the word _padasya_ in this _sutra_, for then the rule would become very much restricted. Moreover in the above examples, there can be no doubling; for सप्तपर्णः means 'that whose every twig bears seven leaves पर्वणि पर्वणि सप्तपर्णानि अस्य : so that the sense of _vipsa_ is not here inherent in the word _sapta_ or _parna_. In the case of the _taddhita_ example, there would be no doubling, because the force of _vipsa_ is there denoted by the _taddhita_ affix itself, and so doubling is not necessary. Moreover, a sentence can never be doubled, because _vipsa_ can take place with regard to a word, and not a sentence. Therefore the word पदस्य should not be employed in the _sutra_.\n\nOn the contrary, if we employ the word _padasya_ in the _sutra_, it would give rise to the following anomalies. We could not have प्रपचति प्रपचति; for _upasarga_ being considered as a separate _pada_, only पचति would be doubled, and प्र would not. So also, we have two forms द्रोग्धा and द्रोढा ॥ Here तृच् is added to the root दुह्, and ह is optionally changed to घ by (VIII. 2. 77), and in the other alternative there is ढ ॥ As घ and ढ are both _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1), the doubling would take place without making this घ or ढ substitution. So that having first doubled the word (something as द्रोह्ता द्रोह्ता) then optional घ or ढ change will take place, and we shall get wrong forms, like द्रोग्धा द्रोढा, द्रोढा द्रोग्धा in doubling. While the correct forms are द्रोढा द्रोढा, or द्रोग्धा द्रोग्धा, and not the hybrid doubling as given above. Hence the necessity of the _vartika_ पूर्वत्रासिद्धीयमद्विर्वचने (See (VIII. 2. 3) last _vartika_).\n\nOr the word सर्व may be considered to be formed by अच् affix of अर्श आद्यच्, meaning सर्वं कार्यं यस्मिन्नस्ति तदिदं सर्व, तस्य द्वे भवतः ॥ That is, all operations having been first performed, then the word is doubled; so that a word in its inchoate state is not doubled.",
    "81002": "Thus in चौर चौर ३, वृषल वृषल ३ दस्यो ३ घातयिष्यामि त्वा, बन्धयिष्यामि त्वा, the second word being _amredita_ is _pluta_. The word आम्रेडित occurs in _Sutras_ (VI. 1. 99), (VII. 1. 57), (VIII. 2. 95), (VIII. 10. 3) &c.\n\nThe तस्य here denotes _avayava_-_shashthi_: and the word परः denotes the _avayava_. In fact, this sutra_ indicates by implication, that a Genitive case is employed, when a member (_avayava_) is denoted. So that the sentences like पूर्वं कायस्य become valid.\n\nIn the above examples, the word has become _pluta_ by (VIII. 2. 95).",
    "81003": "Thus भुङ्क्ते भु॒॒॒ङ्क्ते॒॒; पशून् प॒॒शू॒॒न् ॥\n\nThat is, all the vowels of the _amredita_ become _anudatta_ or accentless. In the above examples, the root भूञ् becomes _atmanepadi_ by (I. 3. 66): the Personal endings are _anudatta_ by (VI. 1. 186); the _vikarana_ शनम् gets the acute by (III. 1. 3); the अ꣡ of this न꣡ is elided by (VI. 4. 111), and thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ becomes finally acute by _udatta_-_nivrtti_-_svara_ (VI. 1. 161). The _amredita_ _bhunkte_ becomes wholly _anudatta_. The word पशु is formed by the affix कु and is finally acute.",
    "81004": "What words express 'always'? The finite verbs, and the Indeclinable words, formed by _krit_ affixes. What 'always' is meant here? The word '_nitya_' here means 'again and again', and this idea of 'repetition' is the quality of an action. That action which the agent does principally, without cessation, is called \"_nitya_\". So that _nitya_ refers to an action (See (III. 4. 22)). Thus पचति पचति 'he cooks continually'. जल्पति जल्पति 'he talks incessantly'. भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति or भोजं भोजं व्रजति 'each one, when he has eaten goes away.' See (III. 4. 22). लुनीहि लुनीहीत्येवायं लुनाति (See III. 4. 2). The affixes _ktva_ and _namul_ formed words and the Imperative mood express the idea of 'again and again', only when they are repeated. While the words formed with the affix यङ् (Intensive) express this idea by the inherent force of the affix, without repetition. Thus पुनः पुनः पचति = पापच्यते ॥ And when this intensive action is continually done, then this word also should be repeated; as पापच्यते पापच्यते ॥ In the above, examples have been given of _nitya_, as illustrated by finite verbs like पचति, Indeclinable _krit_ words like भुक्त्वा, and like भोजं ॥ Now for वीप्सा ॥ In what words the वीप्सा is found ? It is found in nouns (सुप् formed words). As finite verbs (तिङ्) express _nitya_, so inflected nouns (सुप्) express _vipsa_ or a distributive sense. What is meant by the word _vipsa_? It is the wish of the agent to pervade (_vyaptum_ _ichchha_) an object through and through with a certain quality or action. That is, when many objects are wished to be pervaded by the speaker, with a particular attribute or action simultaneously, it is _vipsa_. Thus ग्रामो ग्रामो रमणीयः 'every village is beautiful'. So also जनपदो जनपदो रमणीयः पुरुषः पुरुषो निधनमुपैति ॥\n\nWhen a finite verb is repeated owing to the idea of _nityata_; and we also wish to add to such a verb the affix denoting comparative or superlative degree, such affix must be added after the word has been repeated, as पचति पचतितराम् ॥ But in the case of a noun, which is repeated owing to _vipsa_, the whole superlative or comparative word should be repeated, as आढ्यतरमाढ्यतरमानय ॥",
    "81005": "As परि परि त्रिगर्त्तेभ्यो वृष्टो देवः (I. 4. 88) and (II. 3. 10) 'It rained round about (but with the exclusion of) _Trigarta_'. Similarly परि परि सौवीरेभ्यः, परि परि सर्वसेनेभ्यः ॥ Why do we say when meaning exclusion? Observe ओदनं परिषिञ्चति ॥\n\nVart:- Optionally परि, meaning 'exclusion', is repeated when it occurs not in a compound, as परि परि त्रिगर्त्तेभ्यः or परि त्रिगर्त्तेभ्यः ॥ In a compound, there is no repetition as परित्रिगर्त्तं वृष्टोदेवः, because the word परि has not the meaning of exclusion only here; in fact, the whole compound word denotes here the idea of exclusion, and not the word परि alone.\n\nThe word परि is here a _Karmapravachaniya_ (I. 4. 88), and governs the fifth case by (II. 3. 11). In परिषिञ्चति the word is an _upasarga_.",
    "81006": "As प्र प्रायमग्निभरतस्य शृण्वे (_Rig_ VII. 8. 4), संसमिद्युवते वृषन् ॥ (_Rig_ X. 191. 1), उपोप मे परामृश (_Rig_ I. 126. 7), किं नोदुदु हर्षसे दातवाउ (_Rig_ IV. 21. 9). Why do we say when 'a foot of a verse is completed there by'? Observe प्रदेवं देव्या धिया ॥ This rule applies only to the Vedic verses, for there alone the Preposition may be used separate from its verb. In the secular literature, this rule has no applicability, as Prepositions are never so used.",
    "81007": "The word _samipya_ means 'proximity' whether in time or space. As उपर्युपरि दुःखम्, or उपर्युपरि ग्रामम्, अध्यधि ग्रामम्, अधोधो नगरम् ॥ Why do we say 'meaning near'? Observe उपरि चन्द्रमा: ॥ Why the word is not repeated here : उपरि शिरसो घटं धारयति ॥ The relation expressed here is not that of nearness, but that of above and below.\n\nउपर्युपरि पश्यन्तः सर्व एव दरिद्रति ।\nअधोधो दर्शने कस्य महिमा नोपजायते ॥\n\nHere the doubling is in the sense of _vipsa_.",

Why do we say \"at the beginning of a sentence\"? The Vocative in the middle or the end of a sentence is not to be repeated, as शोभन खल्वसि माणवकः ॥ Why do we say of a Vocative? Observe उदारोदेवदत्तः ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning envy &c'. Observe देवदत्त गामभ्याज शुक्लाम् ॥\n\nIn some books, the _vakya_ is defined as 'a collocation of words having one finite verb', (एकतिङ् पदसमूहो वाक्यं) ॥ In the first example, कन् is added.",
    "81009": "The making it a _Bahuvrihi_ is for the sake of eliding the case-affix, and treating the word as a masculine, even when it refers to a feminine. Thus ए꣡कैकमक्षरं पठति (not एकमेकम्), ए꣡कैकयाहुत्या जुहोति (not एकयैकया). The accent is regulated by (VI. 2. 1). the case-affix is elided by (II. 4. 71), and masculinising by (VI. 3. 34). This double word एकैक should not however be treated like a _Bahuvrihi_ for the purposes of the application of the following three rules, (1) The _sutra_ (I. 1. 29) by which pronouns are not declined as pronouns when members of a _Bahuvrihi_ compound. The word एकैक however is declined like a Pronoun, as एकैकस्मै ॥ For _sutra_ (I. 1. 29) applies to a compound which is really a _Bahuvrihi_, and not to a word-form which is treated like a _Bahuvrihi_. The repetition of the word _Bahuvrihi_ in that _sutra_, though its _anuvritti_ was understood from the preceding one; indicates this. (2) The application of the rule of accent. Thus by the following _sutra_, a word is repeated when a mental pain or affliction over something is expressed. Thus न न करोति, सुसुजागर्ति ॥ This double-word is treated like a _Bahuvrihi_, but not for the purposes of accent. For by (VI. 2. 172) a _Bahuvrihi_ preceded by न or सु gets acute on the final, but not so नन or सुसु ॥ Here four rules of accent present themselves Ist (VI. 1. 223) ordaining acute on the final, 2nd (VI. 2. 1) the first member retaining its accent, 3rd (VI. 2. 172) already mentioned, 4th (VIII. 1. 3) by which the second member becomes _anudatta_. The rule (VI. 2. 1) however regulates the accent, in supersession of the other three. (3) The third rule which does not apply to this _Bahuvrihi_-_vat_ एकैक is the rule of _samasanta_ affixing. Thus ऋक् ॠक्, पूः पूः (doubled by (VIII. 1. 10)) do not get the _samasanta_ affix अ by (V. 4. 74).",

    "81011": "The reason for making it a _Karmadharaya_ is to elide the case-affix (II. 4. 71), to make the first member a masculine term even when the word refers to a feminine (VI. 3. 42), and to regulate the accent by (VI. 1. 223). Thus पटुपटुः, मृदुमृदुः where the first member has lost the case-affix. पटुपट्वी, मृदुमृद्वी where the first member is treated as a masculine, even when there is a क in the penultimate as कालककालिका (See (VI. 3. 37) and (VI. 3. 42); पटुपटुः꣡, पटुपट्वी꣡, the accent falls on the final, for the rule (VI. I. 223) was debarred by (VIII. I. 3), but the present rule re-instates (VI. I. 223). The word उत्तरेषु is for the sake of distinctness, the _sutra_ being an _adhikara_ one, would have applied to the subsequent aphorisms, without even the word _uttareshu_.",
    "81012": "The word प्रकार means both 'difference' and 'resemblance'. It means 'resemblance' here: i.e. the person or thing resembles, but is not fully like, the thing expressing the attribute. Thus पटुपटुः꣡, 'tolerably sharp', मृदुमृदुः꣡ \"pretty soft\", पण्डितपण्डितः꣡ &c. The sense is that the attribute is not fully possessed by the person. The affix जातयिर् (V. 3. 69) also expressing प्रकार, is not debarred by this _sutra_. Thus पटुजातीयः, मृदुजातीयः ॥\n\nWhy do we say _prakare_ \"when denoting somewhat like it\"? Observe पटुर्देवदत्तः 'the clever _Devadatta_'. Why do we say 'an attributive or adjective word'? Observe अग्निर्माणवकः, 'a fiery boy', गौर्वाहीकः 'a cow-like _Bahika_'. Here '_agni_' and '_gau_' are not naturally adjective words, though employed here like adjectives. \n\nVart:- An adjective is repeated when denoting that persons or things possessing that attribute are to be taken in their due order. Thus मूले मूले स्थूलाः, अग्रे अग्रे सूक्ष्माः, ज्येष्ठं ज्येष्ठं प्रवेशयः ॥\n\nVart:- A word denoting more than one is repeated without change of sense, when it denotes the limit or extent of the thing. Thus अस्मात् कार्षापणादिह भवद्भ्यां माषं माषं देहि 'give a _masha_, a _masha_ out of this _karshapana_ to you two': i. e. give only two _masha_ one to each. A _karshapana_ contains many _mashas_, out of them, the extent of gift is limited to two only. This therefore is distinguishable from the distributive double (_vipsa_). The words माषं माषं देहि = द्वौ देहि; the माष does not take the dual case here. Why do we say 'when it expresses the limit'? Observe अस्मात् कार्षापणादिह भवद्भ्यां माषमेकं देहि, द्वौ माषौ देहि, त्रीन्वा माषान् देहि. Here the word माष itself does not express limit, but the qualifying words एकं, द्वौ, त्रीन् &c. Why do we say 'denoting more than one'? Observe अस्मात् कार्षापणादिह भवद्भ्यां माषमेकं देहि ॥\n\nVart:- In expressing perplexity or alarm, a word may be repeated twice. The word चापल in the _vartika_ means 'a confused state of mind'. As अहिरहिः बुध्यस्व बुध्यस्व 'a snake, a snake, beware. beware'. It is not a necessary condition that the word should be repeated twice only, but as many times as one likes, so long as his meaning is not manifest. As : अहिः अहिः अहिः, बुध्यस्व बुध्यस्व बुध्यस्व ॥\n\nVart:- When intensity or frequency of an action is denoted, the word is uttered twice: as, स भवान् लुनीहि लुनीहि इत्येवायं लुनाति ॥ See (III. 4. 2).\n\nVart:- In re-iteration the word is doubled; as, भुक्त्वा भुक्त्वा व्रजति, भोजं भोजं व्रजति ॥ See (III. 4. 22). This has also been illustrated under (VIII. 1. 4).\n\nVart:- The word is repeated when the affix डाच् follows; as, पटपटा करोति, पटपटायते ॥ This doubling takes place when the word denotes an imitation of an inarticulate sound (V. 4. 57). Therefore, not here, द्वितीया करोति, तृतीया करोति, where the affix डाच् denotes 'to plough', (V. 4. 58). Because of this restriction, some read the _vartika_ as, डाचि बहुलम् ॥\n\nVart:- The words पूर्व and प्रथम are repeated when a comparative or superlative sense is to be denoted: as पूर्वं पूर्वं पुष्प्यन्ति, प्रथमं प्रथमं पच्यन्ते ॥ The comparative and superlative affixes are not debarred hereby, as, पूर्वतरं पुष्प्यन्ति, प्रथमतरं पच्यन्ते ॥\n\nVart:- The words ending in the affixes उत्तर and उत्तम (comparative and superlative), are doubled when they refer to feminine nouns and are employed in determining or pondering upon the relative condition of the superiority of one out of two or many; as उभाविमावाढ्यौ, कतरा कतरा अनयोराढ्यता \"Both these are rich: let us ponder how much is their richness.\" सर्व इमे आढ्याः, कतमा कतमा एषामाढ्यता ॥ This is found in words other than those ending in तर and तम; as; उभाविमावाढ्यौ, किदृशी किदृशी अनयोराढ्यता ॥ This is also found where the abstract noun denoting condition (as आढ्यता) is not in the feminine: as, उभाविमावाढ्यौ, कतरः कतरोऽनयोर्विभवः \"Both these are rich, let us see what is their respective greatness.\"\n\nVart:- In denoting reciprocity of action, the Pronominal is doubled; and diversely it is treated like a compound (II. 2. 27) when it is not treated like a compound, then the first word is always exhibited in the nominative singular. See (I. 3. 14), (III. 3. 43), and (V. 4. 127). Thus अन्यमन्यमिमे ब्राह्मणा भोजयन्ति \"these _Brahmanas_ feed one another.\" अन्योन्यमिमे ब्राह्मणा भोजयन्ति ॥ अन्योऽन्यस्य ब्राह्मणा भोजयन्ति = इतरेतरान् भोजयन्ति ॥ The word अन्य and पर are never treated as a compound, and इतर is always so treated. The following are from _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_:- अन्योऽन्यौ, अन्योऽन्यान् अन्योऽन्येनकृतं, अन्योऽन्यस्मैदत्तं, अन्योऽन्येषां पुष्करैरामृशन्ते (_Magh_) परस्परं ॥\n\nVart:- In the feminine and neuter, the augment आम् is added optionally to the second term under the above circumstances, as, अन्योऽन्यामिमे ब्राह्मण्यौ भोजयतः, अन्योऽन्यं भोजयतः, इतरेतरां भोजयतः, इतरेतरं भोजयतः ॥ अन्योऽन्यामिमे ब्राह्मणकुले भोजयतः, इतरेतरामिमे ब्राह्मणकुले भोजयतः, इतरेतरमिमे ब्राह्मणकुले भोजयतः ॥",
    "81013": "The word कृच्छ्र means 'difficulty and sorrow', अकृच्छ्र means 'without difficulty or sorrow, i.e. pleasantly'. Thus प्रियप्रियेण ददाति, सुखसुखेन ददाति, or प्रियेण ददाति, सुखेन ददाति = अतिप्रियमपि वस्त्व नायासेन ददाति ॥ That is, he gives with pleasure, without feeling it as a trouble. Why do we say \"when meaning easily\"? Observe प्रियः पुत्र: \"beloved son\". सुखी रथः ॥",
    "81014": "What is one's own nature, and whatever is natural to one, that is called यथास्व ॥ In this sense is formed यथायथ꣡म् there being doubling and neuter gender. It is an Indeclinable. As ज्ञाताः सर्वे पदार्था यथायथम् = यथास्वभावं \"all objects have been known according to their respective nature\". सर्वेषां तु यथायथं यथास्मीयं ॥",
    "81015": "The word द्वन्द्वं is formed from द्वि by doubling it, changing the first द्व into अम्, and the second द्व into अ ॥ The word द्वन्द्व itself means रहस्य or secret; while it marks 'limit' मर्यादा &c only secondarily, by context of the sentence. Thus द्वन्द्वं मन्त्रयन्ते 'they are consulting some secret'. Limit or मर्यादावचनः, as आचतुरं हीमे पशवो द्वन्द्वं मिथुनायन्ते = माता पुत्रेण मिथुनं गच्छति, पौत्रेण, तत्पुत्रेणापि ॥ (See _Maitr_. _S_. 1. 7. 3 _Sankh_. _Br_. III. 97). Separation of व्युत्क्रमण :- द्वन्द्वयुत्क्रान्ताः = द्विवर्गसम्बन्धेन पृथगवस्थिताः ॥ _Vyutkramana_ means _bheda_ or separation, placing at a different place. Employment with regard to a sacrificial vessel (यज्ञपात्रप्रयोगः) as – द्वन्द्वं यज्ञपात्राणि प्रयुनक्ति वीरः (See (I. 3. 64)) ॥ अभिव्यक्तिः or manifestation : as द्वन्द्वं नारदपर्वतौ, द्वन्द्वं संकर्षण वासुदेवौ = द्वावप्यभिव्यक्तौ साहचर्येण ॥\n\nThe word द्वन्द्वं is found employed in connection with other senses also; as द्वन्द्वं युद्धं वर्त्तते, द्वन्द्वानि सहते धीरः, चार्थे द्वन्द्वः &c.",
    "81016": "This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_, and extends up to (VIII. 3. 55). Whatever we shall treat of here-after, should be understood to apply to a full '_pada_' or a completed word. Thus (VIII. 2. 23), (संयोगान्तस्य लोपः) teaches \"there is elision of the final of what ends in a conjunct consonant\". The word पदस्य must be supplied here to complete the sense : viz, of a word which ends in a conjunct consonant, the final is elided. Thus पचन्, यजन्, from पचन्त् and यजन्त् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of a _Pada_'? Observe पचन्तौ, यजन्तौ where the त् though _sanyoganta_ is not elided, because the stem is no longer called _pada_. The force of the Genitive in पदस्य must be construed according to the context, sometimes as _sthana_-_shashthi_ i.e. \"in the room of the whole _pada_\"; and sometimes as _avayava_-_shashthi_ i.e. \"of a _pada_-of the portion of a _pada_ \".",
    "81017": "Whatever we shall teach hereafter should be understood to apply to that which comes after a _pada_. Thus the _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 19), teaches \"of an _amantrita_\". The phrase पदात्, must be supplied to complete the sense. That is, \"of a _pada_, which is in the Vocative case, and which comes after another _pada_, all vowels become _anudatta_\". Thus पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त \"Cookest thou, _O_ _Devadatta_\". Why do we say, \"after a _pada_\"? Observe देवदत्त पचसि ॥ Here _Devadatta_ is not _anudatta_ (VI. 1. 198).",
    "81018": "The three words _anudattam_ \"unaccented \", _sarvam_ \"the whole\", and _apadadau_ \"not in the beginning of a _Pada_ of a verse\", should be understood to exert a governing influence over all the subsequent _sutras_ of this chapter, upto its end. Whatever we shall treat of hereafter, must be understood to be wholly unaccented, provided that, it does not stand as the first word of a verse or stanza. Thus (VIII. 1. 19), says \"of a Vocative \". The whole of this _sutra_ should be read there to complete the sense, viz: \"all the syllables of a Vocative are unaccented when a word precedes it, and it does not stand as the first word of a hemistich\"; as पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when not at the beginning of a hemistich\"? Observe यत्ते नियतं रजसं मृत्यो अनवधृष्ण्यम्, here मृत्यो though in the Vocative case, is not _anudatta_, as it stands at the beginning of a _Pada_.\n\nSimilarly (VIII. I. 21), teaches \"वः and नः are the substitutes of युष्मद् अस्मद् in the plural\". The present _sutra_ must be read there to complete the sense, viz, when not at the beginning of a verse. Thus ग्रामोवः स्वं, जनपदो नः स्वम् ॥ But at the beginning of a hemistich, we must have the forms युष्माकं and अस्माकं instead of वः and नः ॥ As,\n\nरुद्रो विश्वेश्वरो देवो युष्माकं कुलदेवता ।\nस एव नाथो भगवानस्माकं शत्रुमर्दनः ॥\n\nThe word पाद् in the _sutra_ refers both to the hemistiches of the sacred _Rik_ hymns, as well as to secular _slokas_.\n\nQuestion: Why do we employ the word सर्वं in the _sutra_?\n\nAnswer:- The word _sarvam_ is used in the _sutra_, in order to indicate that a word, which has not acute accent on the first syllable, should also become _anudatta_. For the word पदात् (VIII. 1. 17) is in the ablative case, and shows that the operation taught in any _sutra_ governed by it, will be performed on the first syllable, according to the maxim आदेः परस्य ॥ Therefore, by rule (VIII. 1. 28), the word प꣡चति, which is acutely accented on the first syllable, (because शप् and तिप् are _anudatta_), will only lose its accent in देवदत्तः पचति; but not so the verb करोति which is acutely accented in the middle (by the _vikarana_ accent) in देवदत्तः करोति ॥ But by force of the word सर्वं, करोति also loses its accent.\n\nQuestion: This cannot be the reason, for the author indicates by his prohibition in _Sutra_ (VIII. 1. 29), that a verb loses its accent, where ever that accent may be. For there is no verb when conjugated in लुट् which has acute on the first syllable.\n\nAnswer:- The word '_sarvam_' is used to prevent the operation of अलोऽन्त्यविधिः; for where the rule आदेः परस्य will not apply there the other will apply: so that, if \"_sarvam_\" was not used, the rule would apply to the finals, and not to cases where there were other than initials to be operated upon. Thus the rule (VIII. 1. 28) would apply to कुरुतः꣡ which is finally acute by (VI. 1. 186), in देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तौ कु॒॒रु॒॒तः॒॒, but not to देवदत्तः करोति ॥\n\nQuestion: No; this cannot be the reason of employing the word '_sarvam_' in the _sutra_, for the author indicates that the rule is not confined to the finals, by the prohibition he makes in favor of लृट् in (VIII. 1. 51); for there is no verb, when conjugated in _Lrit_, which has acute on the final. All _Lrit_ is acute in the middle by (VI. 1. 186). So the अलोऽन्त्यस्य rule does not apply.\n\nAnswer:- The word '_sarvam_:' is used for this reason. Had '_sarvam_', not been used, then in those cases where there was no other rule to apply, like (VIII. 1. 19), there only the word would become _anudatta_. But in cases where another rule also operated, there this _anudatta_ rule would not apply, for then there would be two different sentences. For a thing which is already in existence can be made the subject of a rule ordering certain operations to be performed on it; but not so a thing which will come in existence in future time. Thus the words वां and नौ are ordained as substitutes of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ by one sentence (VIII. 1. 20); while another sentence ordains their _anudatta_-hood. So here there is separation of sentences (_vakya_-_bheda_): which is not desireable; for a _vakya_ _bheda_ should be avoided, if possible. But by employing the word '_sarvam_:', this _vakya_-_bheda_ is made tolerable.\n\nAnother reason for employing this word is that the substitutes वां and नौ should come in the room of the whole declined forms of _yushmad_ and _asmad_, with their case-affixes. Had not this word (_sarvam_) been used, then वां and नौ would have replaced only '_yushmad_' and '_asmad_'. Objection:- Will not the _anuvritti_ of the word '_padasya_', cause the whole declined word to be replaced by वां and नौ, not only the crude-forms _yushmad_ and _asmad_? And there cannot be a full word unless it takes case-affixes; so the whole of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ with their case-affixes will be replaced. Where is the necessity of using the word '_sarvam_'? Answer:- This objection will apply to those cases where a _Pada_ is a word ending in a case-affix. But the word पद is a technical term also, and applies to crude forms before certain case-affixes. Thus a nominal stem (not a full word) is also called _Pada_ by (I. 4. 17), before non-_sarvanamasthana_ case-affixes. Therefore _yushmad_ and _asmad_ will be _pada_ before those affixes. Thus before the affix of Dative Dual, they will be called _Pada_; and had सर्वं not been used, then only \"_yushmad_\" and \"_asmad_\" will be replaced and not their case-affixes. Thus ग्रामो वां दीयते, जनपदो नौ दीयते ॥ Here वां and नौ would require after them the case-affix भ्यां otherwise.",
    "81019": "Thus पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒, पचसि य॒॒ज्ञ॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥ The Vocative is acutely accented on the first by (VI. 1. 198), the present makes it all unaccented.\n\nVart:- The rules relating to _nighata_ (by which all syllables of a word become unaccented, such as the present, and (VIII. 1. 28) &c) and to the substitutes of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ apply then only, when the preceding word which would cause the _nighata_ or the substitution, is part of the same sentence with the latter word. Therefore not here:- अयं दण्डो, हरानेन ॥ \"This is the staff. Carry by means of it.\" Here हर does not lose its accent by (VIII. I. 28), though preceded by the Noun _danda_, because these are parts of two different sentences. ओदनं पच, तव भविष्यति । ओदनं पच, मम भविष्यति ॥ \"Cook the food, it will be for thee. Cook the food, it will be for me.\" That is the rice cooked by thee, will do both for thyself and myself. Here the ते and मे substitutions have not taken place (VIII. I. 22) for _yushmad_ and _asmad_, for the same reason.\n\nAnother example is, भवतीह विष्णुमित्रो, देवदत्तागच्छ \"_Vishnumitra_ is here, Come back _Devadatta_.\" Here _Devadatta_, though in the Vocative case, does not lose its accent. Nor can you say that समर्थः पदविधिः will make this _vartika_ redundant. In all the above examples, the different sentences are connected with each other in sense. Thus in the last example, _Devadatta_ was searching for _Vishnumitra_, when some one says to him, 'Here is _Vishnumitra_ come back _Devadatta_.\" Thus the two sentences are _samartha_, yet there is no _nighata_. But the rule will apply here:- इह देवदत्त ! माता ते कथयति । नद्यास्तिष्ठति॑ (VIII. 1. 28) कूलं । शालीनां ते ओदनं दास्यामि ॥ In the last examples the Vocatives, the verbs and the substitutes of _yushmad_ and _asmad_ are not in syntactical construction with the words that immediately precede them, and yet the _nighata_ rule &c does apply: inspite of the general maxim समर्थः पदविधिः (II. 1. 1), for rules relating to completed words apply to such words only which are in construction.\n\nIn the last example, the construction is इह स्थिता माता ते देवदत्त, and not इह देवदत्त. Thus इह is in syntactical construction with स्थिता and not देवदत्त, yet it causes _nighata_ of _Devadatta_. Similarly in नद्यास्तिष्ठति कूलं, the word नद्याः is not in construction with तिष्ठति, but with कूलं, i.e. नद्याः कूलं तिष्ठति; yet it causes the _nighata_ of तिष्ठति ॥ Similarly शालीनां is not in construction with ते, but with ओदनं, i.e. शालीनां ओदनं ते दास्यामि ॥ Yet it causes ते substitution of _yushmad_. Though the preceding words are not _samartha_ with regard to the words that follow them, they cause the changes, because the words are in the same sentence.",
    "81020": "All the three _sutras_ पदस्य, पदात् and अनुदात्तं सर्वमपादादौ are applicable here. Thus ग्रामो वां स्वम् । जनपदो नौ स्वम् । ग्रामो वां दीयते । जनपदो नौ दीयते । ग्रामो वां पश्यति । जनपदो नौ पश्यति ॥\nThese two वाम् and नौ come in the Dual only, because other substitutes have been taught for the Singular and Plural in the two subsequent _sutras_.\nWhy do we say \"for the Genitive, Dative and Accusative\"? In other cases there will be no substitution. As, ग्रामो युवाभ्यां कृतम् ॥ The word स्थ in the _sutra_ indicates that the case affixes must be express and not understood, for the purposes of this substitution. Therefore, not here: इति युष्मत्पुत्रः though here _yushmat_ is preceded by a word in a sentence, and is in the Genitive case yet वः substitution (VIII. 1. 21) does not take place, because the case-affix is elided.",

There is, therefore, where the conjunction is not direct but intermediate the employment of the shorter forms. As ग्रामश्च ते स्वं, नगरं च मे स्वम् ॥\n\nThe particles च, वा, &c denote conjunction, 'separation' 'wonder' &c. Where the sense of 'conjunction.' 'separation' &c are inherent in the pronouns _yushmad_ and _asmad_, and these particles are employed to manifest that sense, there the present _sutra_ will apply its prohibition.",
    "81025": "The word पश्यार्थाः is equivalent to दर्शनार्थाः, and दर्शन means 'knowledge', i.e. verbs denoting 'to know', आलोचन means perception obtained through sight i.e. physical 'seeing' opposed to metaphorical \"seeing\" = \"knowing\". The substitutions of वां and नौ &c. for युष्मद् and अस्मद् do not take place when these pronouns are employed in connection with verbs denoting 'seeing' (metaphorically) but not 'looking' (physically).\n\nThus ग्रामस्तव स्वं समीक्ष्यागतः, ग्रामो मम स्वं समीक्ष्यागतः; ग्रामस्तुभ्यं दीयमानं समीक्षागतः, ग्रामो मह्यं दीयमानं समीक्ष्यागतः, ग्रामस्त्वां समीक्ष्यागतः, ग्रामो मां समीक्ष्यागतः ॥\n\nWhy do we say when not meaning 'to look'?

Observe कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, कम्बलो मे स्वम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after a Nominative\"? Observe कम्बलो ग्रामे ते स्वम्, कम्बलो ग्रामे मे स्वम् ॥\n\nVart:- The option herein taught is restricted to युष्मद् and अस्मद् when not employed in _anvadesa_. But when there is _anvadesa_, then the substitution is compulsory and not optional. This _vartika_ restricts the scope of the _sutra_, and makes it a _vyavasthita_ _vibhasha_. Therefore, there is no option here, where there is _anvadesa_: अथो ग्रामे कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, अथो ग्रामे कम्बलो मे स्वम् ॥\n\nVart:- Others say, that the substitutes वां, नौ &c are all optional, when not employed in _anvadesa_, whether the nominative is preceded by another noun or not. Thus the rules 20, 21, 22, 23 are optional. As : कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, or कम्बलस्तव स्वम्, कम्बलो मे स्वम् or कम्बलो मम स्वम् ॥ Why do we say \"when not in _anvadesa_\"? Observe अथो कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, अथो कम्बलो मे स्वम् ॥ Question: If this is so, where is the necessity of the present _sutra_ at all? Answer:- The present _sutra_ is for the sake of _anvadesa_: i.e. the option taught in the present _sutra_ will take place only then, when there is _anvadesa_ and not otherwise ; thus अथो ग्रामे कम्बलस्ते स्वम्, or अथो ग्रामे कम्बलस्तव स्वम्, अथो ग्रामे कम्बलो मे स्वम्, or अथो ग्रामे कम्बलो मम स्वम् ॥ In other words, according to this _vartika_, rules 20, 21, 22 and 23 are all optional in _anvadesa_, but compulsory where is no _anvadesa_; but when the pronoun is preceded by a nominative which itself is preceded by another word, then the above rules are not compulsory, even in _anvadesa_: there also the option will apply.",
    "81027": "Thus पचति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म्, जल्पति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म्, when contempt is meant.\n\nHere पचति गोत्रं means 'he proclaims his _Gotra_ &c, so that he may get food &c'. पचति is from the root पचि व्यक्तिकरणे 'to make evident' (_Bhuadi_ 184). Similarly जल्पति गोत्रम् \"he repeatedly utters, his descent &c, in order to get married &c\". Where contempt is not meant, it has the force of repetition, i.e. he repeatedly utters his _Gotra_ as one is bound to do, in marriage-rites &c. And पचति पचति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म्, जल्पति जल्पति गो॒॒त्र॒॒म् when repetition or intensity is denoted. Similarly पचति ब्रुवम्, पचति पचति ब्रुवम् ॥ The word ब्रुवं is a noun derived from the root ब्रू by the affix कन्, the वच् substitution for ब्रू has not taken place, as an anomaly.\n\n1 गोत्र, 2 ब्रुव, 3 प्रवचन, 4 प्रहसन, 5 प्रकथन, 6 प्रत्ययन, 7 प्रपञ्च, 8 प्राय, 9 न्याय, 10 प्रचक्षण, 11 विचक्षण, 12 अवचक्षण, 13 स्वाध्याय, 14 भूयिष्ठ, 15 वा नाम (नाम वा) 16 प्रदशन, 17 प्रयजन.\n\nThe word नाम optionally becomes _anudatta_ : in the alternative, it is first-acute. Thus पचति ना॒॒म॒॒ or पचति ना꣡म ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'after a finite verb'? Observe कुत्सितं गोत्रम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"_Gotra_ and the rest\"? Observe पचति पापम् ॥ Here पापं is an adverb.\n\nWhy do we say 'when contempt or repetition is meant'? Observe खनति गोत्रं समेत्य कूपं ॥ \"He digs a well having assembled the _Gotra_\".\n\nThe words 'contempt and repetition' in the text qualify the whole sentence or _sutra_, and not the word गोत्रादि nor the word अनुदात्त understood. For we find that wherever the word गोत्रादि is used in this Chapter, it always implies the sense of 'contempt or repetition'. Thus the word गोत्रादि is used in (VIII. 1. 57) and there also the sense is of contempt and repetition.",
    "81028": "Thus देवदत्तः प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ Why do we say \"a finite verb\"? Observe नीलमुत्पलम्, शुक्लं वस्त्रम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when the preceding word is not a finite verb'? Observe भवति प꣡चति 'the act of cooking exists' = पाक क्रिया भवति ॥ Here the word भवति is a finite verb, therefore the verb _pachati_ does not lose its accent. So also तरनिरिज् ज॒॒य॒॒ति॒॒, क्षो꣡ति, पु꣡ष्यति 'successful he conquers, rules, thrives', अस्म꣡भ्यां जे॒॒षि॒॒ यो꣡त्सिच \"for us conquer and fight\". The word अतिङः is in one sense redundant, because in one simple sentence, two finite verbs cannot be employed; one sentence consists of one finite verb only. But the very fact of this _sutra_ indicates that the condition of समानवाक्य does not apply to this _sutra_; so that the two words need not be portions of the same sentence, for the application of this _nighata_: as we have already explained in (VIII. 1. 19). Other examples are: are अग्निमी॒॒डे॒॒ पुरोहितं (_Rig_ _Veda_. 1. 1. 1). स इद्देवेषु꣡ ग॒॒च्छ॒॒ति॒॒ (_Rig_ _Veda_. I. I. 4), अग्ने꣡ सूपायनो꣡ भ॒॒व॒॒ (_Rig_ _Veda_. V. 1. 1), य꣡जमानस्य प꣡शून् पा॒॒हि॒॒ ॥",
    "81029": "This restricts the scope of the last _sutra_ which was rather too wide. Thus श्वः कर्त्ता꣡, श्वः कर्त्ता꣡रौ, मासेन कर्ता꣡रः ॥ The _Sarvadhatuka_ affixes डा, रौ, रस्, are _anudatta_ after the affix तासि by (VI. I. 186), the whole affix तास् becomes _udatta_ (III. 1. 3) and where the टि portion of तास् i. e. the syllable आस्, is elided before the affix डा, there also the आ of डा becomes _udatta_, because the _udatta_ has been elided. See (VI. 1. 161).",
    "81030": "Thus यत् क॒॒रो꣡ति, यत् प꣡चति, यदि क॒॒रो꣡ति or यदि प꣡चति, हन्त क॒॒रोति, हन्त प꣡चति, कुवित् क॒॒रोति, कुवित् प꣡चति, नेज् जिह्मायन्त्यो नरकं प꣡ताम (_Nir_. I. II), स चेद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, स चेद् अधीते꣡ ॥ The particle चण् with the indicatory ण् has the force of चेत् ॥ Thus अयं च मरिष्य꣡ति = अयं चेन् मरिष्यति ॥ Other examples are त्वम् च सोम नो व꣡शो जीवातुम् न꣡ मरामहे 'if thou, _Soma_ willest us to live, we shall not die' आ꣡ च ग꣡च्छान् मित्र꣡मेना दधाम \"if he will come here, we will make friends with him.\" इन्द्रश्च मूलयाति नः, नतः पश्चादघं नशत् \"If _Indra_ makes us happy &c\". This rule does not apply to the च which is a conjunction meaning 'and'. So also : कच्चिद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, कच्चिद् अधीते꣡, यत्र भुङ्क्ते꣡, यत्राधीते꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"with particles\"? Observe यत् कूजति शकटम् = गच्छत् कूजति शकटम् ॥ Here यत् is not a particle, but the Present Participle of the root इण् 'to go'. It means गच्छत् 'the car creaks while going'. Rule (VIII. 1. 28) applies here.\n\nQuestion: Now by the rule of _Pratipadokta_ &c. that यत् should only be taken, which is a Particle; moreover it is read in connection with other Particles like यदि &c, so it must be a Particle. How then can the Present Participle यत् be taken at all? Answer:- This _sutra_ indicates that the प्रतिपदोक्त rule and the साहचर्य rule do not apply here. Thus the word यावत् formed with the affix वतुप् (V. 2. 39) is also included in the word यावत् of this _sutra_. As तावदुषो राधो अस्मभ्यं, रास्व यावत् स्तोतृभ्यो अरदो गृणानाः = यावतोऽश्वान् प्रतीगृह्णीयात् ॥\n\nWhy do we use the word युक्तं \"in connection with\". Observe यत्र क्व च ते मनो दक्ष दधस उत्तरम् ॥\n\nOther examples are: यं यज्ञं परिभूर꣡सि (_Rig_ _Veda_ I. I. 4.) 'what offering thou protectest'. यत्र नः पूर्वे पितरः परेयुः꣡ 'whither our fathers of old departed'. अद्या मुरीय यदि यातुधानो अ꣡स्मि 'let me die on the spot, if I am a sorcerer', हन्तेयान् पृथिवीम् विभ꣡जामहै \"come on, let us share up this earth\". ब्रह्मा चेद्धस्तम् अ꣡ग्रहीत् 'if a _Brahman_ has grasped her hand', नेत् त्वा त꣡पति सूरो अर्चिणा 'that the sun may not burn thee with his beam' उक्थेभिः कुविद् आग꣡मत् 'will he come hither for our praises' (Whitney's Grammar, Para 595).",
    "81031": "When something urged by one, is rejected insultingly by another, then the reply made by the first tauntingly, with a negation, is _pratyarambha_. Thus A says to B: \"Eat this please\". B rejects the offer repeatedly, in anger or jest. Then A in anger or jest says \"No, you will eat\"-as नह भोक्ष्यसे ॥ Here भोक्ष्यसे retains its accent, which is acute on the middle, for से becomes accentless as it follows अदुपदेश (VI. I. 186), and स्य becomes _udatta_ by the प्रत्ययस्वर (III. 1. 3).\n\nAnother example is नहाध्येष्यसे 'No, you will study'. Why do we say, 'when asseverative? Observe नह वै त꣡स्मिंश्च लोके꣡ द꣡क्षिणमिच्छ॒॒न्ति॒॒ \"Verily in that world they do not wish for fee\". Here it is pure negation. तस्मिन् is first acute by फिट् accent, लोक꣡ is final acute because it is formed by अच् of पचादि (III. 1. 134), द꣡क्षिण is first acute, because it is a Pronoun ending in अ (स्वाङ्गशिटामदन्तानाम् _Phit_ II. 6) and इच्छन्ति is _anudatta_ by (VIII. 1. 28).",
    "81032": "Thus सत्यं भोक्ष्य꣡से 'Truly will you eat'? सत्यमध्येष्यसे ॥ Why do we say 'in questioning'? Observe सत्यं वक्ष्यामि नानृतं 'I shall tell the truth, not falsehood', स॒॒त्यमिद्वा उ॒॒ तं व॒॒यमिन्द्र॑ स्तवाम्॒॒ ॥",
    "81033": "Anything done to injure another is _prati_-_loma_, opposite of this is _apratiloma_, or friendliness. In fact, it is equal to _anuloma_. Thus अङ्ग प꣡च 'yes, you may cook', Here _anga_ has the force of friendly permission. So also अङ्ग प꣡ठ ॥ But when it has the force of _pratiloma_, we have:- अङ्ग कूजा꣡ ३ वृषल ॥ इदानीं ज्ञास्यसि जाल्म \"Well, chuckle O sinner! soon wilt thou learn, O coward\". Here अङ्ग is used in the sense of censure, for chuckling is a thing not liked by the person: and is _pratiloma_ action: for _pluta_-vowel see (VIII. 2. 96).",
    "81034": "Thus स हि कुरु꣡, सहि प꣡च, सहि प꣡ठ ॥ Why do we say 'in friendly assertion'? Observe स हि कू॒॒ज वृषल । इदानीं ज्ञास्यसि जाल्म ॥",
    "81035": "That is sometimes one verb, sometimes more than one verb retain their accent. Thus of more than one verb, we have the following example :- अनृतं हि मत्तो व꣡दति । पाप्मा एनं वि पु꣡नाति 'Because the drunkard tells falsehood, therefore sin will make him impure: i. e. he does incur sin'. Here both verbs वदति and विपुनाति retain their accent: and हि has the force of यत् 'because'. According to _Kaiyyata_ the meaning of this sentence is यस्मान् मत्तोऽनृतं वदति, तस्मादनृतवदन दोषेण न युज्यते i. e. a drunkard does not incur the sin of telling a falsehood, because he is not in his senses. See _Maitr_. _Sanhita_ I. II. 6. As regards one verb in a correlated sentence retaining its accent and the other losing it, we have:- अग्निर्हि पूर्वमुद꣡जयत् तमिन्द्रोऽमूद॒॒ज॒॒यत् ॥ Here the first retains its accent and the second not. The force of हि is to denote here cause and its effect. So also:- अजा ह्यग्नेर꣡जनिष्ट गर्भात् (or गर्भम्), सा वा अ॒॒प॒॒श्य॒॒त्॒॒ जनितारमग्रे (_Taittariya_ _Samhita_ IV. 2. 10, 4). The word अजनिष्ट is first acute, the augment अट् having the accent; while अपश्यत् is all _anudatta_.",
    "81036": "Thus यावद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, यथा भुङ्क्ते꣡ यावदधीते꣡ यथाधीते꣡, देवदत्तः प꣡चति यावत्, देवदत्तः प꣡चति यथा ॥ The meaning is that the verb retains its accent, even when यावत् and यथा follow after it. Another example is यथा चित् कण्वमावतम् ॥ The word आवतम् is the Imperative (लोट्) Second Person Dual of the root अव् ॥ यावत् स्तोतृभ्योऽरदोगृणानाः ॥ The verb अरदः is Imperfect (लङ्) Second Person singular of the root रद् 'to scratch'. The accent, is on अ (the augment).",
    "81037": "That is, the verb loses its accent, and becomes _anudatta_. Thus यावत् प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ शोभनम्, यथा पचति शोभनम्, यावत् करोति चारु ॥ \n\nWhy do we say when denoting 'praise'? Observe यावद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, यथा भुङ्क्ते꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'immediately'? Observe यावद् देवदत्तः प꣡चति शोभनं, यथा देवदत्तः करो꣡ति चारु ॥ Here the verbs retain their accent by the last _sutra_.",
    "81038": "The last _sutra_ taught that the verb loses its accent when immediately preceded by यावत् and यथा ॥ This qualifies the word 'immediately' and teaches that the intervention of a Preposition does not debar immediateness. Thus यथा प्रकरोति चारु, यथा प्रपचति शोभनं, यावत् प्रकरोति चारु, यावत् प्रपचति शोभनम् ॥\n\nThe word 'immediately' is understood here also. Thus यावद् देवदत्तः प्रप꣡चति, शोभनं, यथा विष्णुमित्रः प्रकरोति चारु ॥ The _upasarga_ प्र has _udatta_ accent. Prof. Bohtlingk's Edition reads the sutra as व्यपेतं ॥",
    "81039": "Thus माणवकस्तु भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम्; पश्य माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनं, पश्यत माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम्, अह माणवको भुङ्क्ते꣡ शोभनम् ॥ Why do we say 'when meaning praise'? Observe, पश्य मृगो धा॒॒व॒॒ति॒॒ ॥\n\nThe repetition of the word पूजायाम् here, though its _anuvritti_ could have been supplied from (VIII. 1. 37), shows that the negation of that _sutra_ does not extend here: for the पूजायाम् of that _sutra_ is connected with two negatives, the म of that _sutra_, and the न of (VIII. I. 29), but the पूजायाम् of this _sutra_ is connected with the general न of (VIII. I. 29) only.\n\nAnother example is आदह॑ स्व॒॒धामनु पुन॑र्गर्भ॒॒त्वमे॑रि॒॒रे ॥",
    "81040": "Thus अहो देवदत्तः प꣡चति शोभनं, अहो विष्णुमित्रः करो꣡ति चारु ॥ The separation of this अहो from तु &c, of the last _sutra_, indicates that the next rule applies to अहो only. Had अहो been joined with तु &c, then Rule (VIII. 1. 41), would have applied to तु &c, which is not desired. Hence the making of it a separate _sutra_.",
    "81041": "What is the शेष alluded to here? The शेष means here senses other than पूजा or 'praise'. Thus कटमहो करिष्यसि or कटमहो क॒॒रि॒॒ष्य॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ This is a speech uttered in anger or envy and not in praise (असूया वचनं) ॥ So also मम गेहमेष्यसि ॥\n\nThe word शेष is employed in the _sutra_ simply for the sake of distinctness; for _sutra_ 40 applies to cases of _puja_, while this _sutra_ will give option in cases other than _puja_.",
    "81042": "The word परीप्सा means त्वरा or 'quick'. Thus अधीष्व माणवक पुरा विद्यो꣡तते विद्युत्, or पुरा स्तनयति स्तनयित्नु ॥ The word पुरा here expresses the future occurrence which is imminent or very near at hand. It is against the rule of _Dharmasastras_ to study while it thunders or lightens.\n\nWhy do we say 'when meaning haste'? Observe नडेन स्म पुराधी॒॒य॒॒ते॒॒ ॥ Here the word पुरा expresses a past time; that is, it means \"long ago\". So also ऊर्णया स्म पुराधीयते ॥ See (III. 2. 118) and (III. 2. 122), for the employment of पुर in the Past Tense, and (III. 3. 4), for the Present.",
    "81043": "The word एषणा means 'asking, praying'. The word अनुज्ञा means 'permission'. The compound अनुज्ञैषणा means 'asking of permission'. Thus ननु करो꣡मि भोः, \"may I do it, sir\"; ननु ग꣡च्छामि भोः 'can I go sir'. The sense is 'give me permission to do or to go'.\n\nWhy do we say when 'asking for permission'? Observe अकार्षी कटं देवदत्त ? ननु क॒॒रो॒॒मि॒॒ भोः '_Devadatta_ hast thou made the mat? Well, I am making it'. Here ननु has the force of an answering particle, and not used in asking permission and hence the verb loses its accent.",
    "81044": "Thus किं देवदत्तः प꣡चति, आहोस्विद् भुङ्क्ते ॥ किं देवदत्तः शेते꣡, आहोस्विदधीते꣡ ॥ Here some say, that the first verb (पचति or शेते) being directly joined with किं retains its accent, whilst the second verb (भुङ्क्ते or अधीते) not being joined with किं, loses its accent by the general rule (VIII. 1. 28). Others say, though the word किं is heard in connection with one verb only, yet as both verbs are objects of doubt, therefore, किं is logically connected with both of them, and so both verbs retain their accents. Thus भुङ्क्ते꣡ will retain its accent according to this view.\n\nWhy do we say when the question relates to a क्रिया or action? The rule will not apply, when the question relates to an object or साधन ॥ Thus किं देवदत्त ओदनं प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ आहोस्विच्छाकं ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when a question is asked\"? Observe किमधीते देवदत्तः ॥ Here किं is used to express contempt, and not to ask a question.\n\nWhy do we say 'not preceded by a Preposition'? Observe किं देवदत्तः प्रपचति आहोस्वित् प्रकरोति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"not preceded by a negative particle\". Observe किं देवदत्तो न पठति आहोस्वित् न करोति ॥",
    "81045": "When किम् is elided in asking a question relating to an action, the finite verb which is not preceded by a Preposition or a Negative Particle, optionally does not become _anudatta_. When is there the elision of this किम् because no rule of _Panini_ has taught it? When the sense is that of an interrogation, but the word किम् is not used. In short, the word '_lopa_' here does not mean the Grammatical substitute, but merely non-use. As देवदत्तः प꣡चति (or प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒) आहोस्वित् प꣡ठति (or प॒॒ठ॒॒ति॒॒) Here the sentence is interrogative, even without the employment of किम् ॥ The option of this _sutra_ is a _Prapta_-_vibhasha_, as it is connected with the sense of किम् ॥ The counter-examples are the same as in the last aphorism, but without किम् ॥",
    "81046": "The word प्रहास means great laughter, i.e. derision, mockery, raillery, jeering, gibing, sneering. Thus एहि मन्ये ओदनं भोक्ष्य꣡से, नहि भोक्ष्यसे, भुक्तः सोऽतिथिभिः ॥ एहि मन्ये रथेन यास्य꣡सि, नहि यास्यसि, यातस् तेन पिता ॥ The word एहि is the Imperative second Person of the root इण् preceded by the preposition आङ् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'used derisively'? Observe एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये इति; सुष्ठु च मन्यसे, साधु च मन्यसे ॥\n\nBy _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 51), infra, after the Imperative एहि which is a verb of 'motion' (गत्यर्थ), the following First Future (लृट्) would have retained its accent. The present _sutra_ makes a _niyama_ or restriction, namely that in connection with the Imperative एहि मन्ये, the लृट् is accented only then when 'derision' is meant and not otherwise. Thus the लृट् loses its accent here:- एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये ॥ The employment of the First Person in मन्ये in the _sutra_ is not intended to be taught: for by (I. 4. 106), the verb मन् (मन्यते) takes the affix of the First Person instead of the second, when 'derision' is meant and not otherwise. When प्रहास is not intended, the proper personal affix of the Second Person is employed. The employment of the First Person ceases there also by this restrictive rule. Thus एहि मन्यसे ओदनं भोक्ष्ये ॥\n\nThe above counter example is given according to _Kasika_, according to which एहि मन्यसे इति उत्तमोपादानमतन्त्रम् ॥ But according to _Mahabhashya_, the counter-example is एहि मन्ये रथेन या॒॒स्य॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ Here यास्यसि loses its accent. The meaning of the above is त्वं रथेन यास्यसि इति अहं मन्ये, एहि ॥ According to _Kaiyyata_, this would be an example also under the rule, the First Person not being necessary:- एहि मन्यसे रथेन यास्यामि ॥",
    "81047": "Thus जा꣡तु भोक्ष्य꣡से, जातु अध्यष्य꣡से, जातु करिष्या꣡मि । Here से is _anudatta_ by (VI. 1. 186), as it is an _Sarvadhatuka_ affix coming after an अदुपदेश; the word जातु is first acute, as it is a _Nipata_. Why do we say 'when not preceded by any other word'? Observe:- कटं जातु क॒॒रि॒॒ष्य॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ The word कटं is end-acute as it is a फिट् or noun.",
    "81048": "The word किम्वृत्तं is a Genitive _Tatpurusha_ meaning किमोवृत्तं ॥ The word किम्वृत्तं means any form of किम् with its case-affixes, as well as the forms of किम् when it takes the affixes डतर and डतम ॥ Thus कश्चिद् भुङ्क्ते꣡, कश्चिद् भोज꣡यति, कश्चिद् अधीते, केनचित् करो꣡ति, कस्मैचिद् द꣡दाति, कतरश्चित् करो꣡ति, कतमश्चिद् भुङ्क्ते꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'followed by चित्'? Observe को भुङ्क्ते ॥\n\nThe word अपूर्वं of the last _sutra_ qualifies this also; therefore, the verb loses its accent here:- देवदत्तः किंचित् प॒॒ठ॒॒ति॒॒ ॥",
    "81049": "The prohibition of _nighata_ or want of accentuation is understood here, so also there is the _anuvritti_ of अपूर्वं from the last.\n\nThus आहो or उताहो भुङ्क्ते꣡, उताहो प꣡ठति ॥ Why do we say 'immediately preceding'? In the following _sutra_ will be taught option, when these particles do not immediately precede the verb.\n\nWhy do we say \"when no word precedes them\"? Observe देवदत्त आहो or उताहो भुं॒॒क्ते॒॒ ॥",

    "81051": "Those verbs which have similar meaning with the word गति 'motion' are called गत्यर्थाः ॥ The Imperative of the गत्यर्थ verbal roots, is called गत्यर्थ-लोट् ॥ In connection with such an Imperative of verbs of 'motion', the First Future does not become _anudatta_, if the _karaka_ is not all different. The sense is, with whatever case-relation (_karaka_), whether the Subject or Object, the Imperative is employed, with the same _karaka_, the First Future must be employed. In connection with the finite verb here, the word कारक denotes the Subject and Object only, and not any other _karaka_, such as Instrument, &c.\n\nThus आ꣡ग॒॒च्छ॒॒ दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ग्रा꣡मं, द्रक्ष्य꣡स्येनम् 'Come _O_ _Devadatta_ to the village, thou shalt see it'. Here the subjects of both verbs आगच्छ and द्रक्ष्यसि are the same, and the objects of both verbs are also the same, namely ग्रामं and एनम् ॥ आ is a Preposition and is accented, गच्छ and देवदत्त both lose their accent by (VII. I. 19) and (VII. I. 28), ग्राम is first-acute being formed by the नित् affix मन् ॥ So also आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, ओदनं भोक्ष्यसे \"Come, _O_ _Devadatta_ ! to the village, you will eat rice\". Here the subjects of both verbs are the same, only the objects are different, and so the rule still applies. आहर देवदत्त शालीम्, यज्ञदत्त एतान् भोक्ष्यते꣡ ॥ Here the subjects are different, but the objects are the same; namely शालीम् ॥ Similarly उह्यन्तां देवदत्तेन शालयः, यज्ञदत्तेन भोक्ष्य꣡न्ते \"Let the rice be carried by _Devadatta_, and let them be eaten by _Yajnadatta_.\"\n\nWhy do we say 'verbs of motion'?

Observe आगच्छेर्देवदत्त ग्रामं, द्र॒॒क्ष्य॒॒स्ये॒॒नम् ॥ Here the Potential mood is used.\n\nWhy do we say the 'First Future'? Observe आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, पश्यसि एनम् ॥ Here the Present Tense is used.\n\nWhy do we say 'if the _karaka_ is not wholly different'? Observe आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, पिता ते ओदनं भो॒॒क्ष्य॒॒ते॒॒ ॥ उह्यन्तां देवदत्तेन शालयः, सक्तवस्तेन पा॒॒स्य॒॒न्ते॒॒ ॥ उह्यन्तां is the Imperative of वह् 'to carry'.\n\nWhy do we use the word सर्व 'wholly'? Observe आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, त्वं च अहं च द्रक्ष्या꣡व एनम् ॥ Here also there is prohibition of _nighata_ and the First Future retains its accent, for the subject of the Future is not wholly different from that of the Imperative. For here the subject of the Imperative is the subject also of the Future, though only partly, in conjunction with another. Moreover, the object here in both is the same. Had सर्व not been used in the _sutra_, where the sentence would have remained the same, there the rule would have applied, and not where the sentences became different.",

Nor here, आगच्छेर्देवदत्त ग्रामं पश्येनम् because the first verb is not Imperative but Potential.\n\nIf the subject and object of both Imperatives are wholly different, the rule will not apply. Thus आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, पश्यतु रामं यज्ञदत्तः ॥\n\nBy the force of the _anvritti_ of सर्व the rule will apply to the following: आगच्छ देवदत्त ग्रामं, त्वं चाहं च पश्यावः ॥\n\nThe separation of this _sutra_ from the last is for the sake of the subsequent _sutra_, by which the 'option' is with regard to लोट् and not लट् ॥",

The Personal ending वहै is _anudatta_ by (VI. 1. 186), because the verb is _anudatta_ _it_. The _vikarana_ न therefore retains its accent.",
    "81055": "Thus आम् पचसि देव꣡दत्ता꣡ ३; आ꣡म् भो॒॒ देवदत्ता ३ ॥ The _nighata_ being hereby prohibited, the vocative gets accent on the first syllable by (VI. 1. 198). In the second example, though भो itself is a Vocative, it is not considered to be non-existent by (VIII. 1. 72), but becomes effective by virtue of (VIII. 1. 73), as it is in apposition with the Vocative that follows.\n\nWhy do we say आम्? Observe शाक पचसि दे॒॒व॒॒द॒॒त्त॒॒ ॥ Here it is _anudatta_ by (VIII. 1. 19). \n\nWhy do we say एकान्तरम् 'separated only by one word '? Observe आम् प्र पचसि देवदत्ता ३ ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'the Vocative'? See आम् पचति देवदत्त ॥\n\nWhy do we say अनन्तिके 'not near'? See आम् पचसि देवदत्त ॥ Here some hold that अनन्तिक is equivalent to दूर 'far off'. Therefore, according to them, the prohibition applies to एकश्रुतिः as well as निघातः ॥ Had it been merely a prohibition of _nighata_, then the _sutra_ would become redundant, as the _nighata_ is precluded by the rule of _eka_-_sruti_ (I. 2. 33). Thus arguing, they hold that _eka_-_sruti_ being _asiddha_, the _pluta_-_udatta_ of (VIII. 2. 84), is not prohibited: and so the last vowel is prolated.\n\nOthers say that the word अनन्तिक means 'that which is not far off (दूर) nor very near'. It does not mean दूर only. For had it meant दूर, the author could have used the word दूर in the _sutra_ Therefore the rule of _eka_-_sruti_ (I. 2. 33), has no scope here at all, for it applies to दूर vocatives. Not being दूर, the _plutodatta_ also should not be exhibited in the illustration; for the rule (VIII. 2. 84), applies also to दूर Vocatives.\n\nIn the example आम् भो देवदत्त, the word आम् being a _Nipata_ is first acute; the word भो is a shortened form of भवत्, ((VIII. 3.1). _Vartika_), and it is accentless by (VIII. 1. 19), being a Vocative case preceded by another word. देवदत्त would also have become accentless by the same rule, this _sutra_ prohibits it. The निपात being thus prohibited by this _sutra_, two rules make themselves manifest now for application. The one is of एकश्रुतिदूरात्संबुद्धौ (I. 2. 33) causing एकश्रुति or monotony; the other causing प्लुतोदात्तत्वं by दूराद्धूते च (VIII. 2. 84). The opinions referred to above, relate to this doubt.",

With हि we have, इन्दवो वा मुशन्ति हि (_Rig_ _Ved_. I. 2. 4). The verb उशन्ति is the Present (लट्) Plural of वश् of _Adadi_ class. The _samprasarana_ takes place because it belongs to गृह्यादि class. With न we have, आख्यास्यामि तु ते ॥ By the previous _sutra_ (VIII. I. 30) a verb in connection with यत् would have retained its accent, so also in connection with हि by the _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 34), and in connection with तु by (VIII. 1. 39): the present _sutra_ is, therefore, a _niyama_ rule. The verb retains its accent when these three Particles only follow and not any other. If any other Particle follows, the verb need not retain its accent. Thus जाये स्वा रोहावैहि ॥ Here रोहाव is the 1st Person Dual of the Imperative of रुह्( रुह् + शप् + वस् = रोह + आट् + वस्) (III. 4. 92) = रोहाव the स् being elided, as लोट् is like लङ् (III. 4. 85) and (III. 4. 99). The verb एहि is the 2nd Person Singular of the Imperative of the root इण्, preceded by the Particle आङ् ॥ Here in रोहाव एहि (= रोहाव आइहि), the verb रोहाव is followed by the Particle आ, and does not retain its accent. But for this rule, it would have retained its accent. Because एहि is a गत्यर्थ लोट् (VIII. I. 51), रोहाव is another लोट् in connection with it, and therefore, by (VIII. I. 52) it would have retained its accent. But now it loses its accent because it is a तिङ् following after a non तिङ् word स्वः ॥ It The _visarga_ of स्वः is elided before र् by (VIII. 3. 14), then the preceding अ is lengthened and we have स्वा (VI. 3. 111).

    "81067": "This refers to compounds, the first members of which are praise-denoting words. The word काष्ठादिभ्यः, is added to the _sutra_ from a _Vartika_.\n\nThus काष्ठाध्यापकः, काष्ठाभिरूपकः, दारुणाध्यापकः, दारुणाभिरूपकः ॥\nअमातापुत्र, अमातापुत्राध्यापकः । अमातापुत्राभिरूपक । अयुताध्यापकः । अयुताभिरूपकः । अद्भुत । अद्भुताध्यापकः । अनुक्त । अनुक्ताध्यापकः । भृश । भृशाध्यापकः । घोर । घोराध्यापकः । सुखः । सुखाध्यापकः । परम । परमाध्यापकः । सु । स्वध्यापकः । अति । अत्यध्यापकः । द्यौः । द्यौरध्यापकः । द्यौरभिरूपकः । स्वध्यापकः । अपुत्र । अपुत्राध्यापकः । कल्याण । कल्याणाध्यापकः ॥\n\nVart:- The final म् should be elided in forming these words. The word दारुणं is an adverb, and therefore in the accusative case, like ग्रामं गतः ॥ In such a case, there can be no compounding: hence the elision of म् is taught. This is the opinion of _Vartika_-_kara_ _Katyayana_. According to _Kasika_, there is compounding under मयूरव्यंसकादि rule, and so म् is elided by the general rule of _samasa_. This becoming of अनुदात्त takes place in the compound, and after composition. In fact, it is an exception to the general rule by which a compound is finally acute (VI. 1. 223) But there is no elision in दारुणमध्यापकः &c. and there is no loss of accent also of the second word. By the _Vartika_ 'मलोपश्च', this further fact is also denoted, where the case-affix is not employed and so the म् is not heard, there the second member becomes _anudatta_. When there is no compounding, there is no elision of म् as दारुणमधीते, दारुणमध्यापकः ॥\n\nThough the word पूजन would have implied its correlative term पूजित, the specific mention of पूजित in the aphorism indicates, that the word denoting पूजित should follow immediately after the word denoting पूजन ॥ In fact, this peculiar construction of the _sutra_, is a _jnapaka_ of the existence of the following rule :-\n\nइह प्रकरणे पञ्चमी निर्देशेऽपि नामन्तर्यमाश्रीयते \"In this subdivision or context, though a word may be exhibited in the Ablative case, it does not follow that there should be consecutiveness between the Ablative and the word indicated by it\". This has been illustrated in the previous rule of यद्वृत्तान् नित्यम्, in explaning forms like यद्रयङ् वायुर्वाति &c.\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of '_anudatta_' was current, the express employment of this term in the _sutra_ indicates that the prohibition (of _anudatta_) which also was current, now ceases.\n\nOn this subject, the following extract from the Commentary on _Siddhanta_-_Kaumudi_, will give the view of later Grammarians :- The words काष्ठ &c, are all synonyms of अद्भुत, meaning wonderful, prodigious: and are words denoting praise. This is an aphorism appertaining to _samasa_ subject. In the examples the compounding takes place under the rule of _Mayura_ _vyansakadi_.\n\nVart:- The elision of म् should be mentioned. दारुणम् + अध्यापकः, in making the compound of these two words, the elision of the case affix, in, this case म, is natural. The _vartika_, therefore, teaches nothing new, but only repeats this general rule in a particular form. This is the opinion of the authors of _Kasika_. But according to _Kayyata_, the commentator on the Great _Bhashya_, this aphorism is not a _samasa_ rule: and the words दारुणम् &c, are adverbs not admitting of _samasa_; and so the rule applies to these words when they are not compounded. There is no authority for holding these to be compounds under the _Mayuravyansakadi_ class. _Haradatta_ also says, had this been intended to be a _samasa_ rule, the word समासे would have been used in the _sutra_ and this is valid. There is no _adhikara_ of _samasa_ here, that could have caused _samasa_ and in this view, the _vartika_ मलोपश्च also becomes effective: had it been a _samasa_ rule, the _vartika_ would have been redundant.\n\n1 काष्ठ, 2 दारुण, 3 अमातापुत्र, 4 देश, 5 अनाज्ञात, 6 अनुज्ञात, 7 अपुत्र, 8 अयुत, 9 अद्भुत, 10 अनुक्त, 11 भृश, 12 घोर, 13 सुख्य, 14 परम, 15 सु, 16 अति, 17 कल्याण",

I. 30) in connection with यत्; the present _sutra_ re-ordains the loss, by setting aside the prohibition of (VIII. 1. 30).\n\nThe word सगति 'along with its _Gati_', indicates that the _Gati_ even loses its accent. The word _Gati_ here is restricted to _Upasargas_. Therefore not here यत् काष्ठं शुक्ली करोति, यत् काष्ठं कृष्णी करोति ॥\n\nThe word तिङ् is used in the _sutra_ to indicate that the words qualified by काष्ठं &c in the preceding _sutra_, were non तिङ् words- i. e. were substantives.

Observe प꣡चति क्लिश्नाति ॥\n\nWhy do we say with the exception of गोत्र &c. See प꣡चति गोत्रम्, प꣡चति ब्रुवम्, पचति प्रवचनम् ॥\n\nVart:- It should be mentioned that the 'fault' mentioned in the _sutra_, must be the fault relating to the mode of doing the action, denoted by the verb. The rule will not apply, if the कुत्सन refers to the agent and not to the action. Thus प꣡चति पूतिर्देवदत्तः, प्रपचति पूतिः ॥\n\nVart:- It should be stated that पूति has an indicatory  च ॥ The effect of this is that the word पूति is finally acute, because of the indicatory च ॥ The word पूति is not a क्तिन् formed word, because it is not feminine, as we find it in sentences like पूतिरयम्; nor is it a word formed by क्तिच् affix, because this is not a संज्ञा word; therefore, it is a word without a derivation. Therefore by प्रातिपदिक स्वर (_Phit_ I. 1) it will be end-acute. The _vartika_, therefore, indicates that when पूति causes the loss of accent of the verb, then it is end-acute, but in other cases it is acute on the beginning. According to _Padamanjari_, पूति is derived from पू by adding the _Unadi_ affix तिप् diversely (_Unadi_ IV. 180), and is first acute.\n\nVart:- A finite verb in the plural number, loses its accent optionally: when it loses its accent, then पूति is end-acute. Thus प॒॒च॒॒न्ति॒॒ पूतिः꣡, or पचन्ति पू꣡तिः, प्रप॒॒च॒॒न्ति॒॒ पूतिः꣡ or प्रपचन्ति पू꣡तिः ॥\n\n_Karika_:- The following noun denoting fault must refer to the action. The elision of म is intended only in the case of non-verbs, because it is so said by those of old. The word पूति has an indicatory च, but it is optionally so when the verb is plural. The elision of म् mentioned above refers to the elision of म् in दारुणम्-अध्यापकः = दारुणाध्यापकः ॥ The words उक्तार्थम् mean आचार्यपरंपराकथितप्रयोजनमेतदित्यर्थः ॥",
    "81070": "Thus अभ्यु꣡द्धरति, स॒॒मुदा꣡मयति, अभि॒॒सं॒॒प॒॒र्या꣡ हरति ॥ Why do we say गतिः \"a _Gati_ becomes &c\"? Observe दे꣡वदत्तः प्रपचति ॥ Here देवदत्त is a _Pratipadika_ and does not lose its accent. Why do we say 'when followed by a _Gati_'? Observe आ꣡ मन्द्रैरिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि मयूर रोमभिः ॥ Here आ is a _Gati_ to the verb याहि, the complete verb is आयाहि ॥ But as आ is not followed by a _Gati_, but by a _Pratipadika_ मन्द्र, it retains its accent. Had the word गतौ not been used in the _sutra_, this आ would have lost its accent, because the rule would have been too wide, without any restriction of what followed it.",
    "81071": "The word गतिः is understood here. Thus यत् प्र प꣡चति, यत् प्र॒॒करो꣡ति ॥\n\nWhy have we used the word तिङि in the _sutra_ ? In order to restrict the scope of the word उदात्तवति; so that a _Gati_ would not become accentless before every _udatta_ word, but only before _udatta_ verbs. Thus आ does not become _anudatta_ before मन्द्रैः in आ꣡ मन्द्रै꣡ रिन्द्र हरिभि र्याहि ॥ If it be said that the word गति is a particular name which the Particles get before verb only, and therefore गति would always refer to its correlative term verb, and not to noun, like as the word father refers to its correlative term son and not nephew: and that, therefore, उदात्तवति must refer to the verb like याहि and not to a noun like मन्द्रैः; then also we say that the employment of the term तिङि is necessary, in order to indicate that the verb must be a finite verb, and not a verbal root. So that though a verbal root be _udatta_, yet if in its conjugated form (तिङन्त) it is not _udatta_, the गति will not lose its accent. Thus in यत् प्रकरोति, the root कृ is _anudatta_, but the तिङन्त form करोति is _udatta_, hence the rule will apply here: which would not have been the case had उदात्तवति not been qualified by तिङि ॥ For the maxim is यत्क्रियायुक्ताः प्रादयस् तेषां तं प्रति गत्युपसर्गसंज्ञे भवतः ॥  Therefore in a तिङन्त, the designation of गति is with regard to धातु or verbal root. Objection: If तिङि is used for this purpose, then the rule will not apply to an आम् ending forms, like प्र पचतितराम् and प्रपचतितमान्, for these are not तिङन्त; but as a matter of fact, we find that प्र loses its accent, in these forms also. How is this explained? Answer:- Here there are two views : some compound the _Gati_ प्र with the completed आमन्त form पचतितराम् ॥ According to them, this प्र would get the accent, on the rule that an Indeclinable first member retains its accent (VI. 2. 2); so that even if the word तिङ् was not used in the _sutra_, the form पचतितराम् being the second member of a compound, became _anudatta_; and so प्र being followed by an _anudatta_ never loses its accent. According to them, therefore, the _Gati_ never loses its accent in प्र꣡पचतितराम् &c. Others compound the word ending in तरप् (पचतितर) with the _Gati_, and having formed प्रपचतितर, then add the affix आम् ॥ According to this view, the आम् accent debars all other accents, on the maxim, 'the accent of the last prevails' (सतिशिष्ठः), and so प्र is _anudatta_, not by this rule, but by अनुदात्तसर्वे पदमेकवर्जं ॥ According to them the word is प्रपचतितराम्꣡ ॥ According to both of these views, this _sutra_ is not necessary for the purposes of प्रपचतिराम् &c. But there is a third view which makes this _sutra_ necessary even for this purpose. There is this maxim: गतिकारकोपपदानाम् कृद्भिः सह समासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः \"It should be stated that _Gatis_, _Karakas_ and _Upapadas_ are compounded with bases that end with _Krit_-affixes, before a case-termination has been added to the latter\". This maxim itself has been explained in two different ways, one saying that the compounding takes place with _krit_-formed words only before the addition of case-affixes; but with words formed by _Taddhita_ affixes, the compounding does not take place before a case affix has been added. The other view makes no such difference between _krit_-formed and non-_krit_ formed words. This latter view is not necessary for our purposes. According to the first view, the _Gati_ प्र can never be compounded with पचतितराम् as it is not a सुबन्त ॥ So both प्र and पचतितराम् having different accents, the present _sutra_ became necessary to cause the loss of accent of प्र ॥\n\nWhy have we used the word उदात्तवति? See प्र꣡ पचति, प्र꣡ करोति ॥ Here the verb loses, its accent by (VIII. 1. 28), hence the _Gati_ retains its accent.",
    "81072": "Such a Vocative is treated as if not at all existing, it is simply ignored. The operation which its presence otherwise would have caused does not take place, and that operation takes place which would have taken place had it not existed. What are the particular purposes served by considering it as non-existent? They are (1) the absence of the accent-less-ness of the subsequent vocative, which the first, taken as a पद, would have caused under (VIII. 1. 19). As देव꣡दत्त ! य꣡ज्ञदत्त ! Here the first Vocative देवदत्त does not cause the second Vocative to lose its accent, but it remains first acute by (VI. 1. 198). (2) The accentless-ness of the verb required by (VIII. I. 28) is prevented: as, दे꣡वदत्त प꣡चसि ॥ (3) The substitution of the shorter forms of युष्मद् and अस्मद्, required by (VIII. 1. 20) – (VIII. 1. 23) is prevented, as देवदत्त तव (not ते) ग्रामः स्वम्, देवदत्त मम (not मे) ग्रामः स्वम् ॥ (4) The application of (VIII. 1. 37) takes place, in spite of the intervention of the Vocative between the Particle and the verb; such intervention is not considered as taking away anything from the immediateness (अनन्तरम्) of the Particle from the verb: as, यावद् देवदत्त प॒॒च॒॒सि॒॒ ॥ (5) For the purposes of (VIII. I. 47), though a Vocative may precede जातु, the latter is still considered as अविद्यमानपूर्वं and (VIII. 1. 47) applies, as देवदत्त जातु प꣡चसि ॥ (6) So also in the case of (VIII. 1. 49), as आहो देवदत्त प꣡चसि, उताहो देवदत्त पचसि, no option is allowed here by (VIII. 1. 50).\n\nWhy do we use the word 'as if' or यत् in the _sutra_, instead of saying 'altogether'? In other words, why do we say \"it is considered as if non-existent\", instead of saying \"it is considered altogether non-existent\"? The vocative does produce its own particular effect. Thus in आम् भो देवदत्त ! the vocative भो is considered as one word (एकान्तर) for the purposes of separating आम् from the vocative देवदत्त under (VIII. 1. 55). This is the opinion of _Patanjali_; but the opinion of the author of _Kasika_ is that भो would have been considered as अविद्यमानवत् but for (VIII. 1. 73).\n\nWhy do we say 'a Vocative'? Observe देवदत्तः प॒॒च॒॒ति॒॒ ॥ Why do we say पूर्वं 'with regard to the subsequent word'? The vocative itself will not be considered as non-existent, for the application of rules that would apply to vocative as such. Thus in देव꣡दत्त य꣡ज्ञदत्त, the vocative देवदत्त gets its accent by (VI. 1. 193) also. In fact, the word पूर्वं connotes its correlative पर 'subsequent'; and the vocative is considered as non-existent, for the purposes of the operations to be performed on such subsequent term, whether such operation be caused by the vocative itself, or by any other cause; but it is not to be considered non-existent for the purposes of operations to be performed upon itself. Therefore in दे꣡वदत्त प꣡चसि, _Devadatta_ does get the accent of the vocative. In इमं मे गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वति शतुद्रि the first vocative गङ्गे is considered as non-existent with regard to यमुने, and, therefore, यमुने is considered as following immediately after the _pada_  मे and thus यमुने becomes _anudatta_, not because of गङ्गे, but because of मे; similarly सरस्वति and शतुद्रि are _anudatta_, not because of the preceding Vocative, but because of मे ॥ In other words, the intervention of the vocatives does not stop the action of मे ॥",
    "81073": "This _sutra_ prevents the operation of the last _sutra_ in the particular case when the two Vocatives are in apposition, and the second qualifies the first. Thus अ꣡ग्ने गृ॒॒ह॒॒प॒॒ते॒॒, मा꣡णवकज॒॒टि॒॒ल॒॒का॒॒ध्या॒॒प॒॒क॒॒ ॥ The first vocative being considered as existing, second vocative loses its accent.\n\nWhy do we say 'the vocative subsequent'? Observe देवदत्त प꣡चसि here the verb does not lose its accent. Why do we say 'standing in apposition or समानाधिकरणे? Observe दे꣡वदत्त प꣡ण्डित यज्ञदत्त, here the word पण्डित qualifies यज्ञदत्त, and is not in apposition with देवदत्त, and hence it retains its accent.\n\nWhy do we say सामान्यवचनम् 'which is a generic word'? The rule will not apply when the Vocatives are synonyms. Thus अ꣡घ्न्ये दे꣡वि स꣡रस्वति ई꣡डे का꣡व्ये वि꣡हव्ये एतानि ते अघ्न्ये नामानि ॥ All these Vocatives are synonyms of _Saraswati_, and hence all retain their accent of the Vocative (VI. 1. 198). According to _Padamanjari_ the reading given in _Taittariya_ _Brahmanam_ is:- इडे रत्नेऽदिते सरस्वति प्रिये प्रेयसि महि विश्रुते, एतानि ते अघ्निये नामानि ॥ सामान्यवचनम् means 'a generic term'. When the first is a generic term, and the second is a specific term, (विशेष वचन) qualifying the first, and both are in the singular number, there the present rule will apply.",
    "81074": "This ordains option, where the last _sutra_ would have made the consideration of the first vocative as existent compulsory. Thus दे꣡वाः श꣡रण्याः or दे꣡वा श॒॒र॒॒ण्याः॒॒ ॥ ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै꣡याकरणाः or ब्रा꣡ह्मणा वै॒॒या॒॒क॒॒र॒॒णाः॒॒ ॥\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of सामान्यवचनम् is understood here; the second vocative, therefore, must be a विशेषवचन, as being the correlative of the former: where is then the necessity of employing the word विशेषवचने in the _sutra_? This word is used in the aphorism for the sake of precision only.\n\nWhy do we say 'in the plural number'? Observe मा꣡णवक ज॒॒टि॒॒ल॒॒क॒॒ ॥ No option is allowed here, and the preceding vocative is always considered as existent and so rule (VIII. 1. 73) applies.\n\nThe _sutras_ (VIII. 1. 73) and (VIII. 1. 74) as enunciated by _Panini_ are:- 73. नामन्त्रिते समानाधिकरणे; 74. सामान्यवचनं विभाषितं विशेषवचने (i. e. (VIII. 1. 73). The preceding Vocative is not considered as non-existent, if the subsequent word is a Vocative in apposition with it. 74. Optionally so, if the preceding vocative is a general term and the subsequent vocative is a particular term). _Patanjali_ made the amendment by adding सामान्यवचने to 73 also, and the author of _Kasika_ has added बहुवचनम् to 74 from the commentary of _Patanjali_ and has omitted सामान्यवचनं from it: though he reads its _anuvritti_.",
    "82001": "This is an _Adhikara_ or governing rule, and extends upto the end of the Book. Whatever we shall teach hereafter is to be understood as non-existent, with regard to the preceding rule. With regard to whatever has been taught in the preceding Seven Books and a quarter, the rules contained in these three last chapters are considered as _asiddha_. And further, in these three chapters, a subsequent rule is, as if it had not taken effect, so far as any preceding rule is concerned. The word in असिद्धम् = असिद्धवद्भवति, सिद्धकार्यं न करोति ॥ The rule is \"as if non-effective, does not produce the operation of a _siddha_ or effective rule\". This rule of non-effectiveness is for the sake of prohibiting the operation of an _adesa_ rule, and establishing the operation of an _utsarga_ or general rule. Thus अस्मा उद्धर; द्वा अत्र; द्वा आनय, असा आदित्यः ॥ In all these, the elision of व् and य् by (VIII. 3. 19), being considered as not to have taken effect, there is no further _sandhi_, and आ + उ does not give rise to _guna_, nor आ + अ = आ ॥ In fact, for the purposes of the application of आद्गुणः rule of (VI. 1. 87), or the दीर्घ rule of (VI. 1. 101), the rule (VIII. 3. 19) is considered as not to have taken effect at all.\n\nSimilarly अमुष्मै, अमुष्मात्, अमुष्मिन् from अदस् ॥ Thus अदस् + ङे = अद + ङे (VII. 2. 102) अ being substituted for the final स्, which again merges in the preceding अ (VI. 1. 97) = अमु + ङे (VIII. 2. 80). उ being substituted for अ, and म् for द् of अद). Now the substitution of स्मै for ङे takes place only after Pronouns ending in अ; but अमु is a pronoun ending in उ, so this स्मै (VII. 1. 14) should not take place. The present _sutra_ helps us out of this difficulty, and the change of अ into उ by (VIII. 2. 80) is considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of the application of (VII. 1. 14).\n\nशुष्किका शुष्कजङ्घा च क्षामिमानौजढत्तथा ।\nमतोर्वत्वे भलां जश्त्वं, गुडलिण्मान्निदर्शनम् ॥\n\nThe forms शुष्किका, शुष्कजङ्घा, क्षामिमान्, औजढत्, and गुडलिण्मान् illustrate this rule excellently.\n\n(1) शुष्किका ॥ To the root शुष् we add the _Nishtha_ त, as शुष् + त = शुष् + क (त changed to क by (VIII. 2. 51)) = शुष्क ॥ Add the feminine affix टाप् and we have शुष्का ॥ Add to this the affix क (V. 3. 70), (V. 3. 73), as शुष्का + क  = शुष्काक, the feminine of which with टाप् will be शुष्कका (the shortening taking place by (VII. 4. 13)). Now अ is changed to इ by (VII. 3. 44) and we have शुष्किका ॥ Now rule (VII. 3. 46) makes this इ substitution optional, when a क् precedes the अ, as is the case here: and that rule would require the alternative form शुष्कका ॥ But there is no such alternative form, because the क of शुष्क was the substitute of त by (VIII. 2. 51), which is considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of the application of (VII. 3. 46).\n\n(2) शुष्कजङ्घा ॥ Here rule (VI. 3. 37) would have required the form to be शुष्काजङ्घा like मद्रिकाकल्पा; there being no _pun_-_vad_-_bhava_ when there is a penultimate क ॥ But the क in शुष्का being the result of (VIII. 2. 51) is considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of (VI. 3. 37).\n\n(3) क्षामिमान् ॥ This word may be considered to have been formed by adding the affix मतुप् to the Patronymic word क्षामिः or to the noun क्षामिन् [क्षामस्यापत्यं = क्षामिः, or क्षामोऽस्यास्तीति = क्षामिन्] ॥ The word क्षाम is formed by adding the _Nishtha_ त to the root क्षै, as क्षै + त + क्षा + त (VI. 1. 45) = क्षाम (the त being changed to म by (VIII. 2. 53)). Now this म is considered as non-effectual for the purposes of application of (VIII. 2. 9), which requires the change of म of मत् to व, when मत् is added to a word having a penultimate म, as in शमीवान् ॥ Therefore we have क्षामिमान् and not क्षामिवान् ॥\n\n(4) औजढत् ॥ This is the Aorist third person singular of the Derivative root औढि, from the Past-Participle of वह् ॥ Thus वह् + त = ऊढ (VI. 1. 15). Add to it णिच् in the sense of तमाख्यत् (III. 1. 26): and then form its लुङ् ॥ The लुङ् is formed by adding चङ् (III. 1. 48), before which the stem is reduplicated (VI. 1. 11). In reduplicating, all the rules that went before in forming ऊढ are considered _asiddha_; viz. the rule by which ह was changed to ढ (as वह् + त = उह् + त = उढ् + त (VIII. 1. 31), the rule by which त was changed to ध (उढ् + त = उढ् + ध (VIII. 1. 40), the rule by which ध was changed to ढ (VIII. 4. 41), and the rule by which the first ढ was elided (VIII. 3. 13) as उढ् + ढ = उ + ढ = ऊढ (VI. 3. 111). The elision of टि before णि being considered _sthanivat_, we reduplicate ह्त; as ऊह्तढ + चङ् + त् = ऊहढत् (VII. 4. 60) = ऊझढत् (VII. 4. 62) = ऊजढत् (VIII. 4. 54). There is no इ added by (VII. 4. 79), because of the prohibition of अनग्लोपे of (VII. 4. 93). With the augment, it becomes औजढत् ॥ The form औजिढत् is from उढि ending in the affix क्तिन् ॥\n\n(5) गुडलिण्मान् ॥ This is formed by adding मतुप् to the word गुडलिह्, which is formed by क्विप् (गुडं लेढि) Here also the म of मतुप् is not changed into व by (VIII. 2. 10); because the change of ह् to ढ् (VIII. 1. 3), and again of ढ् to ड् are considered _asiddha_.\n\nThe rules of interpretation, however, contained in the previous part will apply to this part also; because such rules cannot be considered 'prior' or पूर्व; for they become operative then only when occasion requires to apply them. The maxim which governs such rules is कार्यकालं हि संज्ञा परिभाषम् ॥ The rules, therefore, which are exhibited here in the sixth case such as (VIII. 2. 23), or the seventh case, as (VIII. 2. 26), or the fifth case, as (VIII. 2. 27), should be interpreted in accordance with the _sutras_ षष्ठी स्थाने योगा, तस्मिन्निति निर्दिष्टे पूर्वस्य, तस्मादिति उत्तरस्य ॥\n\nBut with regard to the _paribhasha_ विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यं, the above will not hold good. For, by the very fact, that a subsequent rule in these chapters, is held to be _asiddha_, with regard to the prior, there cannot arise any conflict of two rules of equal force with regard to them. And it is only where there is such a conflict, that the above rule of interpretation applies. This being so, in विस्फोर्यम्, अवगोर्यम् formed by ण्यत् (III. 1. 124) the _guna_ ordained by (VII. 3. 86) is not debarred by the दीर्घ rule (VIII. 2. 77), because there is no conflict between _guna_ rule (VII. 3. 86) and the _dirgha_-rule (VIII. 2. 77), for the latter is simply non-existent with regard to the former.\n\nBut though the विप्रतिषेध rule does not apply in these chapters; yet an _apavada_ rule here even, does over-ride an _utsarga_ rule, for otherwise, the enunciation of an _apavada_ rule would be useless. The _apavada_ rule is therefore, not considered _asiddha_. Thus the _utsarga_ rule होढः (VIII. 2. 31) is set aside by the _apavada_ rule दादेर्धातोर्घः (VIII. 2. 32), and thus we have दोग्धा, दोग्धुम् (दुह् + तृच् = दोघ् + तृच्) ॥",
    "82002": "The word विधि in the _sutra_ applies to all the four words preceding it: as सुब्विधि, स्वरविधि &c. The force of the Genitive compound in स्वरविधि, संज्ञाविधि, तुग्विधि is that of ordaining the existence of something: e.g. when an accent is to be given to a word, or a particular designation is to be given to it or when त् is to be added to it, (भावसाधन) ॥ The compound सुब्विधि means however, the rule relating to the case-endings themselves, as well as, the rule which would apply to a word, when a case-ending follows (कर्मसाधन) ॥\n\n(1) सुब्विधि :- As राजभिः, तक्षभिः ॥ Here the elision of न् of राजन् and तक्षन् being _asiddha_, the भिस् is not changed to ऐस् by (VII. 1. 9). So also राजभ्याम्, तक्षभ्यां, राजसु, तक्षसु ॥ Here the finals of राज and तक्ष are not lengthened before भ्यां by सुपिच (VII. 3. 102) and nor changed to ए before सु by (VII. 3. 103): as in नराभ्यां and नरेषु of the stem ending in अ ॥\n\n(2) स्वरविधि :- As रा꣡जवती and not राजवती꣡ ॥ For the elision of न् being _asiddha_, the rule (VI. 1. 220), does not apply, for the word is considered not to end in अवती but न्वती ॥ Similarly in पञ्चार्मम् and दशार्मम्, the elision of न being _asiddha_, the first member does not become _ady_-_udatta_ by (VI. 2. 90). Similarly पञ्चवीजी : the elision of न् being _asiddha_, the first member does not retain its original accent as required by (VI. 2. 29).\n\nThe word राजन् is first acute, as it is formed by the affix कनिन् (_Unadi_ I. 156). राजवती is formed by adding ङीप् to the मतुप् ending word, by (IV. 1. 6). पञ्चार्मम् is a compound under rule (II. 1. 50) of पञ्चन् + अर्म, and when न् is elided, the first member becomes a word ending in अ and would require the accent of (VI. 2. 90).\n\n(3) संज्ञाविधि :- As पञ्च ब्राह्मण्यः, दश ब्राह्मण्यः ॥ The elision of म् being _asiddha_, the words पंच and दश are still called _shash_ though they no longer end in न् (ष्णान्ता षट् (I. 1. 24)). Being called षष्, they do not take टाप् in the feminine (IV. 1. 10).\n\nAccording to the _Vartikakara_, there is no necessity of using the word संज्ञा in the _sutra_ (संज्ञा ग्रहणानर्थक्यं च नन्निमित्तंत्वाल्लोपस्य), because the elision of न् is caused by reason of its having such a designation (as षट्). Thus without its having the name of षट् there would be no elision of जस् and शस्, without such elision, there is no _pada_ _sanjna_ of these words, and unless these words get _Pada_ designation, there can be no elision of न् by (VIII. 2. 7). The _shash_ designation, however, would not be retained by these words after taking plural affixes, when feminine affixes are to be added to them, but for this _sutra_. The पञ्चन् and दशन् ending in न् would require ङीप् in the feminine, which is however prohibited, for when जस् and न् are elided, the words end in अ and require टाप् for their feminine, which is also prohibited, because, by the present _sutra_ the word still retains its designation of षट् ॥\n\nQuestion: How can this be the purpose of this _sutra_? There are two views as regard definitions (संज्ञा), the one is that a particular name is given to a thing once for all, prior to any operations; and operations are performed afterwards upon it or with it, as occasions arise. This view is embodied in the maxim यथोद्देशं संज्ञापरिभाषम् '_Sanjna_, and _Paribhashas_ remain where they are taught.' The other view is that the _sanjna_ _sutra_ is to be read with every particular operative _sutra_, and the _sanjna_ given to the word afresh, with every new operation. In other words, the _sanjna_ _sutra_ becomes identified with a _vidhi_ _sutra_, every time that a _vidhi_ is to be applied. This is embodied in the maxim कार्यकालं संज्ञापरिभाषम् \"_Sanjnas_ and _Paribhasas_ are attracted by or unite with the rules that enjoin certain operations.\" In the first view, the षट् _sanjna_ will be good throughout, both for the purposes of eliding जस् and शस् and for prohibiting टाप् ॥ Hence thus _sutra_ is not necessary in that view. But in the other view, the _sutra_ is necessary. For if the view be taken that a _sanjna_ is to be applied with regard to each operation, then that षट् _sanjna_ which had taken effect for the purposes of eliding जस् and शस्, will no longer hold good for the purposes of preventing the application of the feminine affix. Hence, the word संज्ञा is taken in this _sutra_, to prevent the application of the second view.\n\n(4) तुग्विधिः - Thus वृत्रहभ्यां, वृत्रहभिः ॥ On account of the elision of म् being _asiddha_, the तुक् augment is not added, though required by (VI. 1. 71). (ह्रस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक्) ॥\n\nSome hold that तुक् need not be read in the _sutra_. They argue in this way:- There is this maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य \"That which is taught in a rule, the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things, does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination\". Now the elision of न् of वृत्रहन् took place because of the case affix भ्यां, this elision cannot be the cause of adding तुक् ॥ Or the तुक् being a बहिरङ्ग operation would be _asiddha_ with regard to the _antaranga_ elision of न् ॥ This opinion is, however, not sound. The employment of तुक् in this _sutra_ indicates, that the two maxims above referred to, are not of universal application i.e. they are _anitya_.\n\nWhy do we say before a _Krit_-affix? Observe वृत्रहच्छत्रम्, वृत्रहच्छाया ॥ Here तुक् is added by (VI. 1. 73).\n\nThe elision of न् taught by (VIII. 2. 7) &c would be _asiddha_ by the general rule (VIII. 2. 1); the specification of the four cases in which it is _asiddha_ shows that it is a restrictive or _niyama_ rule. That is, the elision of न् is considered _asiddha_ only with regard to these four rules, and no other. It is not _asiddha_ in राजीयते (राजन् + क्यच् + ते = राज + य + ते = राजीयते) (III. 1. 8), (VII. 4. 33). There would not have been long ई had the नलोप been _asiddha_. So also राजायते there is lengthening, (VII. 4. 25) and राजाश्च there is _ekadesa_ (VI. 1. 101).",
    "82003": "The existence of सु is not considered uneffected when there is to be added ना ॥ On the contrary, it is considered as _siddha_ or existing. Thus सु being considered as _siddha_, अमु gets the designation of घि by (I. 4. 7), and as such, its Instrumental Singular is by (VII. 3. 120), अमुना ॥ Had the सु been considered as non-effected, then the stem would not have been called _ghi_, and there would have been no  ना added. But when ना had been added, then the सु being _asiddha_, अमु is considered to be as अद ending in अ, and this अ would require lengthening by सुपि च (VII. 3. 102): but it is not done on the maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य \"that which is taught in a rule the application of which is occasioned by the combination of two things does not become the cause of the destruction of that combination\". There being no long आ the उ of अमु remains short. Or this _sutra_ may be considered to be the condensation of two _sutras_ (1) सु, is _siddha_ when ना is to be added, (2) सु is _siddha_ when any operations, otherwise to be caused when ना is added, are to take place. Or the sense of the _sutra_ is ने परतो यत् प्राप्नोति तस्मिन् कर्त्तव्ये मुभावो नासिद्धः \"the सु is not non-effected in relation to any operation that would otherwise be occasioned when ना followed\". From this, it would follow by implication that सु must be considered valid for the purposes of नाभाव itself. So सु being always _siddha_, ना is added : and there is no lengthening.\n\nVart:- That _ekadesa_ accent which is _antaranga_, should be considered as _siddha_. What is the necessity of this _vartika_? In order to regulate the accents of 1. अय्, 2. आय्, 3. आव् substitutions of ए, ऐ and औ; 4. the accent of _ekadesa_ substitutes, 5. the accent of the शतृ formed words, 6. for the purposes of rule (VI. 1. 158), by which all syllables of a word are _anudatta_ except one, and 7. for the purposes of (VIII. 1. 28), by which all syllables become _anudatta_.\n\nThus (1) let us take अय् first. वृक्ष꣡ is finally acute by _Phit_ I. 1. The locative of this is वृक्ष + ङि (_anudatta_ (III. 1. 3)) = वृक्षे꣡ (ए is _udatta_ (VIII. 2. 5)). Now combine वृक्षे꣡ + इदम् = वृक्ष꣡य् + इदम् = वृक्ष꣡ इदम् ॥ So also प्लक्ष इदम् ॥ The _udatta_ _ekadesa_ ए꣡ must be considered as _siddha_, so that the अय् substitute of ए should also become _udatta_. (2) आय् : As कुमार्या꣡ इदम् ॥ Here also आ is _udatta_ for similar reasons. कुमारी + ङे = कुमारी + आ॒॒ + ए॒॒ (VII. 3. 112) = कुमार्य् + आ॒॒ + ए॒॒ = कुमार्य् + आ꣡ + ए॒॒ (VI. 1. 174) = कुमार्य्  + ऐ (VI. 2. 90) = कुमार्यै꣡ (VIII. 2. 5). The ऐ is _udatta_ and its आय् substitute will also be _udatta_. How do you give this example? This example is then valid, when by (VI. 1. 174), first the affix आ is made _udatta_, then this आ (आट् (VII. 3. 112)) augment is added to ङे, and then (आ + ए) there is _vriddhi_ ऐ; and then कुमार्य्  + ऐ = कुमार्यै ॥ But if the order be reversed and आ + ए be first combined into ऐ, and then this ऐ꣡ be made _udatta_ by (VI. 1. 174), then there would be no necessity of this _vartika_ for the purposes of आय् ॥ The word कुमार꣡ is end-acute by _Phit_ accent (_Phit_ I. 1). And to it ङीप् in the feminine (IV. 1. 20), as कुमार꣡ + ई = कुमार् + ई॒॒ (अ is elided by (VI. 4. 148) = कुमार् + ई꣡ (VI. I. 161) = कुमारी꣡ ॥\n\n(3) आव्. As वृक्षावि꣡दम् or प्लक्षावि꣡दम्, for the same reasons as above [ वृक्ष꣡ + औ (_anudatta_) = वृक्षौ꣡ (VIII. 2. 5), वृक्षौ + इदम् ].\n\n(4) एकादेश accent. As गाङ्गेऽनूपे ॥ Here गाङ्ग꣡ + इ = गाङ्गे ॥ The word गाङ्ग is formed by अण् affix (गंगाया इदम्) and is end-acute. The _ekadesa_ ए is _udatta_ by (VIII. 2. 5). This _udatta_ accent will remain valid: so that when for ए + अ there is _purva_-_rupa_-_ekadesa_ by (VI. 1. 109), this _ekadesa_ ए will be _udatta_ by (VIII. 2. 5), or it will be _svarita_ by (VIII. 2. 6). The word अनूप꣡ is a प्रादि compound, आपोऽनुगतं = अनूपं ॥ Here by (VI. 2. 2), the Indeclinable first term would have retained its accent: but the word is end-acute by (VI. 2. 189).\n\n(5) शतृ - accent. As तुदती, तुदते ॥ Here in तुद् + श + शतृ, the affix श is _udatta_, and शतृ is _anudatta_. The _ekadesa_ अ will be _udatta_ by (VIII. 2. 5). This _ekadesa_ - _udatta_ should be considered valid for the purposes of the rule (VI. 1. 173) by which the feminine affix and the weak case-ending are _udatta_. Thus तुद꣡त् + ई꣡ = तुदती꣡, तुद꣡त् + ए = तुदते꣡ ॥ The prohibition अनुमः in (VI. 1. 173) is a _jnapaka_ or indicator of the fact that the _ekadesa_ accent should be considered _siddha_, in the accent of the शतृ, because without this _ekadesa_ accent, there is no _satri_ ending word with नुम् which is _antodatta_.\n\n(6) एकामनुदात्तः accent. As तुदन्ति, लिखन्ति ॥ Here in तुद् + श + अन्ति॒॒ (VI. 1. 186) the _ekadesa_ अ is _udatta_ by (VIII. 2. 5), and this _ekadesa_ accent is considered valid for the purposes of rule (VI. 1. 158), by which all the remaining syllables become _anudatta_, as तु॒॒द꣡न्ति॒॒, लि॒॒ख꣡न्ति॒॒ ॥\n\n(7) सर्वानुदात्तः accent. As ब्राह्मणास्तुद॒॒न्ति॒॒, ब्राह्मणा लि॒॒ख॒॒न्ति॒॒ ॥ Here the _ekadesa_-accent of तुदन्ति and लिख꣡न्ति being valid, rule (VII. 1. 28) applies, and all the syllables become _anudatta_.\n\nThe word _antaranga_ is used in the _vartika_ to indicate that the _Bahiranga_ _ekadesa_ accent will not be _siddha_. Thus पचती꣡ति and प्र꣡पचती꣡ति, where the word इ꣡ति is first acute, as it is an Indeclinable. And सोमसुत् पचती꣡ति ॥ The accent of पचति + इति = पचतीति is governed by (VIII. 2. 5). This _ekadesa_ accent of long ई has reference to external _sandhi_, and therefore naturally it is a _bahiranga_. This _bahiranga_ _ekadesa_ accent is not _siddha_ for the purposes of the application of previous _sutras_. Thus _sutra_ (VIII. 1. 71). requires that the _gati_ should be unaccented before an accented verb: but प्र does not lose its accent, as पचतीति is not considered as an accented verb. In the second example, the ई of ती is not considered as accented, therefore, it does not become _anudatta_ by (VIII. 1. 28).\n\nVart:- The rule (VIII. 2. 23) causing the elision of the final consonant in a word ending with a conjunct consonant, should be valid for the purposes of changing रु into उ ॥ What is the necessity of this _vartika_ ? Observe हरिवो मेदिनं त्वा ॥ The word हरिवः is formed by मतुप् affix हरयोऽस्य सन्ति = हरि + मत् ॥ Now by (VIII. 2. 15) the म is changed to व, as हरि + वत् or हरिवत्; add सु (Vocative Singular) as हरिवत् + सु, then add नुम् augment, as हरिवन्त् + सु ॥ Then there is elision of the final consonant = हरिवन् ॥ Now by (VIII. 3. 1). the final न् is changed to र्, and we have हरिवर्, the र् would be changed to उ by (VI. 1. 114), if the elision of the conjunct consonants be considered as _siddha_: for then this र् is followed by म, a हश् letter. But if such elision be considered _asiddha_, then र् is considered not to be followed by हश् letters, but by the consonants which were elided.\n\nVart:- When _ekadesa_ is to be done, the elision of सिच् is to be considered _siddha_ or valid. As अलावीत् and अपावीत् ॥ Here the सिच् is elided by इट ईटि (VIII. 2. 28.) This elision is considered valid or _siddha_, and thus we have _dirgha_ single substitution of ई for इ + ई as अलाव् + इ + सीत् = अलाव् + इ + ० + ईत् = अलावीत् ॥\n\nVart:- The substitute of the _Nishtha_ affixes should be considered as valid or _siddha_ for the purposes of the rules relating to the (1) changing of स to ष्, (2) accent, (3) affix, and (4) इट् augment. As (1) वृकणः, वृकण्वान् ॥ The root is ओव्रश्चु (VI. 11) the indicatory ओ shows that the _nishtha_ त is changed to न (VIII. 2. 45). This _nishtha_ substitute is considered as valid or _siddha_, and the final of the root is not changed to ष, as it otherwise would have been by (VIII. 2. 36): for न would have been still considered as त or a झल् letter. The equation is as follows :- व्रश्च् + त = वृश्च् + त (VI. 1. 16) = वृश्च् + न (VIII. 2. 45) = वृच् + न (VIII. 2. 29) = वृक् + न  (VIII. 2. 30) = वृक्णः (VIII. 4. 1) The च् is changed to क् by (VIII. 2. 30), by considering न as _asiddha_ and therefore equal to त or a झल् letter. Thus it will be seen that this न is असिद्ध for the purposes of rule (VIII. 2. 30), but it is सिद्ध only for the purposes of rule (VIII. 2. 36).\n\nAs regards the other three cases, viz, accent, affix and इट् augment, the one word क्षीब्, will illustrate them all. The irregular formation of this word is variously explained. It is formed by \"_nipatana_\" under (VIII. 2. 55). It is the Past Participle of the root क्षीब्, thus evolved क्षीब् + इट् + त = क्षीब् + इ + त = क्षीब् + अ (इत् being elided, this is the anomaly) = क्षीब ॥ Here the elision of इत् is considered as valid and _siddha_, and therefore, क्षी꣡ब is considered as a word of two syllables, for the purposes of accent, under rule निष्ठाच द्व्यजनात् (VI. 1. 205). Had the _lopadesa_ of इत् been considered _asiddha_, the word would have been considered as if of three syllables, and that rule of accent would not have applied.\n\nSimilarly क्षीबेन तरति = क्षी꣡बिक formed by ष्ठन् (IV. 4. 7) which affix is added, because it is considered a word of two syllables, the elision of इत् being considered as valid for the purposes of (IV. 4. 7).\n\nSimilarly क्षीब may be considered to have been formed by eliding the त्; as क्षीब् + त = क्षीब् + अ ॥ In this view of its formation, the augment इट् is not added, because the _lopa_ of त् is considered as valid and _siddha_ for the purposes of इट् augment. In the opinion of _Patanjali_, the words इट् विधि may well be omitted from the _vartika_, for इट् being a portion of a प्रत्यय, the word प्रत्ययविधि would include इट्-विधि also.\n\nVart:- The prolation modification of a vowel (_pluta_) should be considered as valid and _siddha_, for the purposes of the rule relating to तुक् augment before the letter छ ॥ Thus by (VIII. 2. 107), the Vocative words अग्ने and पटो assume the forms अग्ना३इ, and पटा३उ ॥ These इ and उ are _pluta_-_vikaras_. As अग्ना ३ इच्छत्रम् । पटा ३ उच्छत्रम् ॥ Here the modification caused by (VIII. 2. 107), is considered as valid and _siddha_; otherwise there would have been no compulsory तुक् augment as required by (VI. 1. 73) but optional तुक् under (VI. 1. 76).\n\nVart:- The श् and palatal change should be considered _siddha_ and valid before घुट् (VIII. 3. 291). The root श्चुतिर् क्षरणे (1. 41) is read as beginning with a स, which is changed to श because of the subsequent च by (VIII. 4. 40). This is not considered _asiddha_. Had it been so, there would come घुट् augment by (VIII. 3. 29), in अट् श्च्योतति, रट् श्च्योतति ॥ The words अट् and रट् are अड् and रड् formed from the roots अटति and रटति by क्विप् ॥\n\nWhy is the root श्च्युतिर् considered to begin with स् and not with श् as we find it written? Because had it been a root beginning with श् originally, we could not get the form मघुक् which would have been मघुट् ॥ The form मघुक् is thus evolved. Thus मधु श्च्योतति = मधुश्च्युत् by adding क्विप् ॥ From मधुश्च्युत् we form a Derivative root in णिच् in the sense of मधुश्च्युतमाचष्टे = मधुश्च्ययति ॥ Add again क्विप् to this Derivative root मधुश्चि, the णिच् will be elided, and we have मधुश्च्य्, then श् (which represents स्) is elided because it is at the beginning of a compound letter (VIII. 2. 29), and य् is elided, because it is at the end of a conjunct letter final in a _pada_ (VIII. 2. 23), and thus there remains मधुच्, and च् is changed to क् (VIII. 2. 30) we have मधुक् ॥ Had the root been शकारादि, then this श could not be elided, and so we should elide only the final च् and य् and the form would be मधुश् which would be changed to ष् and then to ट् and we should get मधुट् which is not desired.\n\nVart:- The जश् and चर् substitution of letters in the reduplicate should be considered _siddha_ and valid for the purposes of ए change (VI. 4. 120) and तुक् augment. Thus बभणतुः and बभणुः ॥ Here the जश् change of भ, to ब in the reduplicate should be considered as valid, otherwise this would be अनादेशादि root and the Perfect would be भेणतुः and भेणुः ॥ Similarly from छिद् we have चिच्छित्सति, and from उच्छ, उचिच्छिषति ॥ In the latter, the second syllable छिस् of उछिस् (Desiderative) is reduplicated by (VI. 1. 2). Here had the reduplicate substitute च for छ been considered _asiddha_, there would not have been तुक् augment by छे च (VI. I. 73)\n\nVart:- The change of letter homogeneous with the subsequent is valid and _siddha_ for the purposes of doubling. As सय्यन्ता, सव्व्वत्सरः, यल्ल्लोकम्, तल्ल्लोकम् ॥ In सय्यन्ता &c the म् is changed to _anusvara_ by (VIII. 3. 23), and the _anusvara_ is then changed to a letter homogeneous with the subsequent by (VIII. 4. 58). Had the परसवर्ण change been _asiddha_, there would have been no doubling by (VIII. 4. 47).\n\nVart:- If there be the _adhikara_ of the word '_pada_' in those _sutras_ which ordain the following changes, then those changes are considered _siddha_ for doubling, namely, 1. लत्व the change into ल (VIII. 2. 21), 2. ढत्व the change into ढ (VIII. 2. 31), 3. घत्व the change in to घ (VIII. 2. 33). 4. नत्व the change into न (VIII. 2. 56), 5. रुत्व the change to रु (VIII. 2. 75), 6. षत्व the change to ष (VIII. 3. 85), 7. णत्व the change to ण (VIII. 4. 11), 8. _anunasika_ change (VIII. 4. 45), 9. छत्व the change to छ (VIII. 4. 63).\n\nAs 1. गलो गलः; गरोगरः ॥ 2. द्रोग्धा द्रोग्धा ॥ 3. द्रोढाद्रोढा ॥ 4. नुन्नो नुन्नः or नुत्तो नुत्तः ॥ 5. अभिनोऽभिनः or अभिनद् अभिनत् This is लङ् second person singular of भिद्, the स् of सिप् is elided by (VI. 1. 68), and the final त् changed optionally to रु by (VIII. 2. 74). The न is the _vikarana_ श्नम् ॥ 6. मातुः ष्वसा मातुः ष्वसा or मातुः स्वसा, मातुः स्वसा, 7. माषवापाणि माषवापाणि or माषवापानि माषवापानि ॥ 8. वाङ् नयनम् वाङ् नयनम् or वाग्नयनम् वाग्नयनम् ॥ 9. वाक् च्छयनं वाक्च्छयनं or वाक्शयन वाक्शयनं ॥\n\nThe लत्व &c, changes being all optional, had the changes been considered _asiddha_, we would have got the following double forms also गरोगल, गलोगरः which are not desired.\n\nAll these can be explained by dividing the _sutra_ न मु ने into two. The first being न, and this negative will prohibit all _asiddha_-ness mentioned in the preceding _vartikas_. The second _sutra_ would be मु ने, and we would here draw in the _anuvritti_ of न from the preceding.",
    "82004": "An unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_, when it comes after a यण् (semi-vowel), which यण् itself has come in the room of a vowel which was acute or _svarita_ once.\n\nLet us first take the vowel following an _udatta_ _yan_. Thus कुमा॒॒र्यौ॑, कुमा॒॒॑र्यः ॥ The word कुमारी꣡ is acutely accented on the final, because the long ई (ङीप्) replaces अ꣡ of कुमार (VI. 1. 161). The semi-vowel य् is substituted in the room of this acute ई꣡; the _anudatta_ आ and अः become _svarita_ after such a य् ॥\n\nNow to take an example of a _svarita_-_yan_. The words सकृल्लू꣡ and खलपू꣡ are finally acute by _krit_-accent (VI. 2. 139). The Locative singular of these words are खलपू꣡ + इ॒॒ = खल्पिवं, and सकृल्ल्वि by (VI. 4. 83). This व् is a semi-vowel which comes in the room of the acute ऊ꣡, therefore, it is _udatta_-_yan_. After this _udatta_-_yan_, the _anudatta_ इ of the Locative becomes _svarita_ by the first part of this _sutra_. Now when खलप्वि॑ + आशा꣡ and सकृल्ल्वि॑ + आशा꣡ are combined by _sandhi_, this _svarita_ इ is changed to य्; it is, therefore, a _svarita_-_yan_. The unaccented आ will become _svarita_, after this _svarita_-_yan_. As खलप्व्या॑शा and सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा ॥ The word आशा is finally acute and consequently आ is not acute (_Phit_. I. 18).\n\nObjection:- Here an objector may say: that the _svarita_ accent on इ in खलप्वि is by this very _sutra_, this _svarita_ is to be considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of यण् _adesa_ of (VI. 4. 83). How can then the य् substituted for this इ be considered as _svarita_-_yan_?\n\nAnswer:- This is considered as _siddha_ by _asraya_. (आश्रयात् सिद्धत्वम्) ॥\n\nObjection :-If this be so, then उदात्तादनुदात्तस्य स्वरितः (VIII. 4. 66) should also be considered as _siddha_: and we should have _svarita_ in दध्याशा &c also. For the word द꣡धि is first-acute by _Phit_ Il. 3. Therefore धि is _svarita_ by (VIII. 4. 66). The य् is _svarita_ _yan_, the _anudatta_ आ after this should become _svarita_ according this view, but this is not so.\n\nAnswer:- To avoid this difficulty, we have the following.\n\nVart:- यण्स्वरो यणादेशो सिद्धो वक्तव्यः ॥ \"The यण् accent should be considered as valid, for the purposes of यण् substitution\".\n\nSome say, that even in such cases as दध्या॑शा the above rule applies, and that the unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_, if it follows a _svarita_-_yan_ which is preceded by an acute vowel. They quote the following from _Taittariya_ _sakha_ : यास्ते विश्वाः समिधः सन्त्यग्ने, where the अ of अग्ने is pronounced as _svarita_. So also in the _Brahmana_ portion as : दध्या॑शयति the आ is read as _svarita_. But according to _Katyayana_ and _Patanjali_, the unaccented vowel does not become _svarita_ by this _sutra_, when it follows a _svarita_-_yan_ which is preceded by an acute vowel.\n\nTo get rid of these anomalies, the _Mahabhashya_ proposes several alternatives, two of which will be mentioned here. The first proposal is to divide this composite _sutra_ into two parts: (1) उदात्तयणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति \"an unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_ when it follows after an _udatta_ _yan_\". (2) स्वरितयणश्च परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति \"an unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_, when following a _svarita_ _yan_\" and in this second _sutra_, we shall read the _anuvritti_ of _udatta_-_yan_ from the preceding half. So that this half will mean: उदात्तयण इत्येवं यो निर्वृत्तः स्वरितः, तस्य यणः परस्य अनुदात्तस्य स्वरितो भवति ॥ The _svarita_ must have been obtained by the application of the first half of this _sutra_ and this _svarita_ should be changed to यण्, which would change the _anudatta_ into _svarita_. So that the स्वरित यणः means this particular _svarita_ obtained by the application of this very _sutra_.\n\nThe second proposal is not to read _svarita_ into the _sutra_ at all. The _svarita_ in सकृल्ल्व्या॑शा would then be explained by _udatta_-_yanah_ rule. सकृल्लू + इ + आशा = सकृल्ल्व् + य् + आशा ॥ Here व् is _udatta_-_yan_. This will cause आ to become _svarita_. The intervening _svarita_ य् is considered as not existent for the purposes of accent स्वरविधौव्यञ्जनमविद्यमानवत् ॥ Nor is this य् to be considered as _sthani_-_vad_ to इ by (I. 1. 57), for in applying the rule of accent, such a substitute is not considered as _sthanivat_ by (I. 1. 58).\n\nWhy do we say \" of _udatta_ and _svarita_\"? Observe बैदी꣡ + आशा꣡ = बैद्याशा, so also शार्ङ्गव्याशा ॥ Here the semi-vowel replaces an unaccented ई, and is अनुदात्त यण् ॥ These words are first acute owing to नित् accent (IV. 1. 73).\n\nWhy do we say \"an unaccented vowel becomes _svarita_\"? Observe कुमार्यत्र, किशोर्यत्र ॥ The word अ꣡त्र is acutely accented on the first by लित् accent. (VI. 1. 193).",
    "82005": "The word \"of an _anudatta_\" is understood here. An unaccented vowel, which combined with the preceding _udatta_ vowel remains as a single substitute, becomes _udatta_. Thus for the _udatta_ इ of अग्नि꣡ and for the case-ending औ which is _anudatta_, there is always substituted long ई single by (VI. 1. 102). This single substitute will be _udatta_ according to the present sutra_, as अग्नी꣡ ॥ Similarly वायू꣡, वृक्षैः꣡, प्लक्षैः꣡ ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"with _udatta_ vowel\"? Observe पचन्ति, यजन्ति ॥ Here पच् + शप् + अन्ति = प꣡च् + अ + अन्ति । Here शप् is _anudatta_ by (III. 1. 4), so also अन्ति by (VI. 1. 186). The _ekadesa_ of these two non-accented अ will be _anudatta_. In forming this _para_-_rupa_ _ekadesa_ by (VI. 1. 97), the _svarita_ of the अ of शप् caused by (VIII. 4. 66) is considered as invalid or _asiddha_.\n\nOther examples are क्व वोऽश्वाः (_Rig_. V. 61. 2) and क्वावरं मरुतः ॥ The word वः is _anudatta_ by (VIII. 1. 21). read with (VIII. 1. 18). The word अ꣡श्वः is acutely accented on the first, as it is formed by adding क्वन् to अश् (_Unadi_ I. 151). The स् of वस् is changed to व् (VIII. 2. 66), which is again changed to उ (VI. 1. 113). Thus वोऽश्वः ॥ Here अ becomes _purva_-_rupa_ by (VI. I. 109), which is _udatta_. क्व is formed from किम् by अत् affix (V. 3. 12) and (VII. 2. 105) and is _svarita_ (VI. 1. 185). The word अ꣡वर is acutely accented on the first by the _Phit_ II. 6. The single long substitute is _udatta_.",
    "82006": "Thus सु + उत्थितः = सू꣡त्थितः or सू॑त्थितः; वि॑ + ईक्षते = वीक्ष꣡ते or वीक्ष॑ते; वसुकः + असि = वसुकोऽ॑सि or वसुकोऽ꣡सि ॥ Here the word सु is a _Karmapravachaniya_  by (I. 4. 94), when it is compounded by प्रादिसमास with the Past Participle, the _Avayayibhava_ compound retains the accent of its first member (VI. 2. 2), and so it is acutely accented on the first, and the rest are _anudatta_. Thus the _udatta_ उ꣡ of सु is compounded with the _anudatta_ उ॒॒ of उत्थितः which stands at the beginning of a _Pada_, and so the _ekadesa_ is optionally _svarita_. In वीक्षते and वसुकोऽसि also the verbs ईक्षते and असि lose all accent by (VIII. 1. 28) and so ई and अ become _anudatta_, which when compounded with वि and वसुका become optionally _svarita_.\n\nThe word स्वरितः is employed in the _sutra_ only for the sake of distinctness, for the _sutra_ may have well stood as वाऽनुदात्ते पदादौ ॥ In this form of the _sutra_, the _udatta_ of the preceding _sutra_ would become optional when the second member is a word beginning with _anudatta_. _Udatta_ being optional, in the other alternative, where there will not be _udatta_, the _svarita_ will be substituted by reason of the nearness in position.\n\nWhy do we say \"_anudatta_ beginning\"? Observe देवदत्तोऽत्र ॥ Here अत्र begins with _udatta_ and not _anudatta_, and hence no option is allowed.\n\nWhy do we say \"beginning of a word\"? Observe वृक्षैः, वृक्षाः, प्लक्षैः and प्लक्षाः, where _anudatta_ case-endings are not beginnings of words.\n\nAccording to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshita_ this is a _vyavasthita_-_vibhasha_; in this wise. There will necessarily be _svarita_ (1) where a long ई is the single substitute of (इ + इ) or of two short इ, (2) where there is _purva_-_rupa_ by the application of एङपदान्तात् अति (VI. 1. 109). There will be _udatta_ where a long vowel comes in. Thus in वि + इदम् = वीद॑म् in वी३दं॒॒ ज्योति॒॒र्हृद॑ये, the long ई is substituted for two short इ's. This substitution of a long ई for two short इ's is technically called प्रश्लेष ॥ Where there is _Praslesha_, the long ई is necessarily _svarita_. Similarly when there is अभिनिहतसन्धिः i. e. the peculiar _sandhi_ taught in (VI. 1. 109). Thus ते॑ऽवदन्, सोऽय॒॒मागा॑त् ॥ So also where there is क्षैप्रः सन्धिः i.e. the substitution of a semi-vowel in the room of an _udatta_ or _svarita_ vowel, as अन्या॑भि ॥ The above rules about _svarita_ are thus summarised in the _Pratisakhyas_ : इकारयोश्च प्रश्लेषे क्षैप्राभिनिहतेषु च ॥ But where a long ई is substituted as a single substitute for इ + ई (one of the इ's being long), there it must always be acute. As अस्य श्लोको दि॒॒वीयते (_Rig_. 1. 190. 4). The words दिवि꣡ + ईय॒॒ते॒॒ are compounded into दिवीयते ॥ The word दिवि꣡ Locative singular is finally acute by (VI. 1. 171). ईयते is from the _Divadi_ root इङ् गतौ, and has lost its accent by (VIII. 1. 28).",
    "82007": "The word पदस्य 'of a _Pada_' is understood in this _sutra_. Thus राजा, राजभ्याम्, राजभिः, राजता, राजतरः, राजतमः ॥ The Nominal stem राजन् gets the designation of _Pada_, before these affixes, by (I. 4. 17).\n\nWhy do we say 'of a _Pratipadika_ or Nominal stem'? Observe अहन्नहिम् ॥ Here अहन् is a verb, the 3rd Person Singular Imperfect (लङ्) of the root हन् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'at the end'? If the word अन्तस्य had not been used in the _sutra_, then the _sutra_ would have stood thus नलोपः प्रातिपदिकस्य; and as the word पदस्य is understood here, the _sutra_ would have meant, there is elision of न्, where ever it may be, of a _Pada_ called stem. So that the न of नराभ्याम् would also have required elision. In fact, the genitive case here in पदस्य is not _sthana_ _shashthi_, but _viseshana_ _shashthi_, a नलोप अन्तग्रहणं पदाधिकारस्य विशेषणत्वात् ॥\n\nQuestion: But even if you use the word अन्त in the _sutra_, it is compounded with the word प्रातिपदिक, and the sense of the _sutra_ will be \"न् which is at the end of a _pratipadika_, which (_pratipadika_) is a portion of a _pada_\" &c. and not \"न् which is at the end of a _pada_\". So that the rule will not apply to अहन्नराभ्यां but will apply to राजानौ &c? Answer:- The word प्रातिपदिक is not compounded, with the word अन्त in the _sutra_. It is used without any case-affix, on the analogy of _Chhandas_ usage. In fact, it is in the genitive case, the affix being elided by (VII. 1. 39).\n\nVart:- The prohibition must be stated with regard to the elision of the न of अहन् ॥ As अहः, In अहर् the case-affix सु is _luk_-elided by (VII. 1. 23), the _pratyaya_-_lakshana_ is prohibited by (I. 1. 63), and hence the न् of अहन is changed to र् by (VIII. 2. 69). अहोभ्याम्, अहोभिः ॥ For the rules (VIII. 2. 68) and (VIII. 2. 69) by which the final of अहन् is changed to र्, are _asiddha_ with regard to this present rule requiring elision of न्, hence this _vartika_.\n\nThere is no necessity of this _vartika_, for the subsequent rules (VIII. 2. 69), (VIII. 2. 68) will debar नलोप ॥ Answer:- But रु and र are considered _asiddha_ for the purposes of न elision. The रु and र would have debarred न elision, had they otherwise found no scope. But they have their scope. Question: Where have they their scope? Answer:- In the penultimate अ i.e. in the अ preceding the न् ॥ Question: The very fact that the author has used the word अहन् in the _sutra_ (VIII. 2. 68), shows that रु does not replace अ but न् ॥ Answer:- If so, then र will find scope in the Vocative, हे अहन् where न् is retained by (VIII. 2. 8), and it will be this न् which will be replaced by र्, as ह अहर् and so also हे दीर्घाहो निदाघ !\n\nThe word दीर्घाहन् is a _Bahuvrihi_ (II. 2. 24), the Vocative affix is elided (VI. 1. 68), and the न् changed to र् by (VIII. 2. 68), and it is changed to उ (VI. 1. 114). In हे अहन! the न् is not elided by the option of the _Vartika_ under (VIII. 2. 8).\n\nTo remove these objections, they say, the word अहन् which is used in (VIII. 2. 68) is in nominative singular without the elision of न्, and it is to be repeated as अहन् अहन् ॥ The one indicates the exact form, showing that the न् is not elided; and by the second word the रु is ordained for this final न् ॥",
    "82008": "This debars the elision of न्, which otherwise would have taken place by the preceding _sutra_. The examples of non-elision, of न् in the Locative singular are to be found in the _Vedas_. As परमे व्योमन् (_Rig_. I. 164. 39), आर्द्रे चर्मन्, लोहिते चर्मन् ॥ Here the sign of the Locative, namely इ (ङि) is elided by (VII. 1. 39). In the Vocative Singular, the न् is not elided, as हे राजन्, हे तक्षन् ॥\n\nQuestion: When ङि or the Vocative is elided, the preceding stem is no longer a _Pratipadika_, and the stem does not get the designation of पद before the affix but is भ, hence where is the necessity of making the present prohibitory rule, when the elision of न् would not have taken place in the Locative and Vocative singular, by any rule ?\n\nAnswer:- The very fact of the prohibition of the elision of न्, as contained in this aphorism, indicates by implication (_jnapaka_), that a word retains the designation of _pratipadika_, though an affix has been elided after it and though such elided affix may produce its effect ((I. 2. 45) read with (I. 1. 62)). Nor will such elided affix give the designation of _Bha_ (भ) to such a stem. Thus राज्ञः पुरुषः = राजपुरुषः, here the न् is elided by considering the word राजन् as a _pratipadika_, even after the elision of the Genitive affix in the compound, and it is not a _Bha_, which would have required the elision of अ by (VI. 4. 134).\n\nVart:- Prohibition of the prohibition must be stated, when the Locative word is followed by another word in a compound. That is, when a compound is a Locative _Tatpurusha_, the न् is elided : as, चर्मणि तिला अस्य = चर्म तिलः ॥\n\nIn हे राजवृन्दारक ! the first member राजन् does not retain its न् by the present _sutra_, because the whole compound, as such, is in the Vocative case, and not the word राजन् ॥ In fact, there can be no compound, which in its analysis, will give the first member as a Vocative word.\n\nVart:- Optionally so in the neuter nouns. As, हे चर्मन्, हे चर्म !",

I. 164. 4), अक्षण्वता लाङ्गलेन; शीर्षण्वती, मूर्द्धन्वती ॥\n\nThe word अक्षण्वत् is thus formed : अक्षि + मतुप् = अक्ष् + अन् + मत् (अनङ् is substituted for the final of _akshi_ by (VII. I. 76)) = अक्षमत् (the म् is elided by (VIII. 2.7)). Now we add the augment नुट् ॥ If this augment is added to मतुप्, as म्मतुप् then it becomes a portion of मतुप्, and this म् would be changed to व by (VIII. 3. 9) read with (I. I. 54), and not the letter म्, because म् intervenes. If we add this augment to the end of the stem, then in अक्षण्वता &c. we cannot change it to ण because of the prohibition in (VIII. 4. 37), and the augment being नुक्, the न् would be changed to र् by (VIII. 3. 7) in सुपथिन्तरः &c (VIII. 2. 17). The first view, however, is the correct one and the difficulty in its acceptance is obviated by नुटोऽसिद्धत्वात् तस्य च वत्वं न भवति; ततः परस्य च भवति; as shown above.\n\nThe नुट् augment being considered as _asiddha_, is not changed to व, but the letter following it, is so changed.

In the first view, the _sutra_ would mean, \"the र् immediately followed by अयति is changed to ल ॥\" But as a matter of fact,  र् is never immediately followed by अयति ॥ Thus in प्र + अयति or परा + अयति, the letter अ and आ intervene respectively. The _ekadesa_ _sandhi_ of these, will make र् immediately followed by अयति; but the _ekadesa_, being _sthanivat_ will prevent it. This difficulty however, is overcome by the maxim येन नाव्यवधानं तेन व्यवहितेऽपि वचनप्रामाण्यात्, for otherwise the rule will be useless. For the same reasons, परि + अयते = पल्ययते, though here र् intervenes between र् and अयते ॥ In short, the intervention of one letter is considered as no intervention.\n\nIn the second view, the _sutra_ would mean when a Preposition is followed by _ayat_ then its र् is changed to ल, and none of these difficulties will arise with regard to the above forms. But then would arise a fresh difficulty, for the र् of प्रति would also require to be changed into ल् ॥ Some say, that प्रति is never followed by अयति; while others hold that the form प्लत्ययते (प्रति + अयते) is valid. According to the first view, the valid form is प्रत्ययते ॥ The स् of the Prepositions दुस् and निस् is changed to र्, but this र् is not changed to ल्, because it is _asiddha_: thus we have the forms निरयणम्, दुरयणम् ॥ But there is a preposition निर् also the र् of which is changed to ल्, as निलयनम् ॥ See (VII. 2. 46).

Thus it is ordained in श्रेयन्र् where the present _sutra_ applies, as well as पयर् where this _sutra_ does not apply. But the जश्त्व rule (VIII. 2. 39) covers the whole ground of रुत्व, hence if जश्त्व rule were not debarred by रुत्व, the latter would find no scope.

Similarly it does not apply to पयस् धावति, where स is changed to रु and then to उ (VI. 1. 114) = पयो धावति ॥ The elision of स् in सग्धिः from घस् with क्तिन्, and in बब्धाम् from भस् in the Imperative with ताम्, is a Vedic diversity. But according to _Patanjali_ चकाधि is the proper form; while in पयो धावति the _antaranga_ रु debars this _bahiranga_ स् elision.\n\nObjection:- If so, how do you form आशाध्वं, by the elision स् of शास्; for स् would not be elided? Answer:- The स् is not here elided but changed to जश् letter, by (VIII. 2. 39). Objection:- If so, स् may always be changed to जश् letter, and there is no need of eliding it; in pronouncing, it will make no difference, whether you pronounce with one consonant or two, e.g. आशाद्ध्वम् or आशाध्वं ॥ Moreover by so doing, you will shorten the _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 78), by omitting the word लुङ् from it. For the forms like अच्योड्ढ्वम्, अप्लोड्ढ्वम्, will be evolved regularly by changing स् of सिच् to ष्; and the ध after it will be changed to ढ, and then ष् changed to ड् by जश्त्व (VIII. 4. 53). Answer:- So far it will be all right, but in सेट् Aorist we shall never get the alternative forms अलविध्वम् &c, though we may get the form अलविड्ढ्वम् (VIII. 3. 79). Therefore, the word सिच् should be taken.\n\nObjection:- If सिच् is to be taken here, then the स् of घस् and भस् will not be dropped, and we shall not get the forms सग्धिः and बब्धां in the passages सग्धिश्च मे सपितिश्च मे, and बब्धां ते हरीधामाः ॥ Therefore, the present _sutra_ should not be confined to सिच् only. Answer:- We shall explain सग्धिः by saying, that it is a word derived from सघ्, and so also बब्धां from the root बन्ध ॥\n\n[N. B.- The word सग्धिः is generally thus derived; अद् + क्तिन् = घस् + ति (II. 4. 39) = घ्स् + ति (VI. 4. 100) = घ् + ति (VIII. 2. 26). Had the present rule been confined to सिच्, the स् could not have been elided by (VIII. 2. 26). See (VI. 4. 100), where these two forms are developed]. Or we may explain these forms as Vedic irregularity, by which letters are sometimes dropped, and so घस् and भस् have lost their स् ॥ That letters are sometimes dropped in the _Chhandas_, we see in passages like the following इष्कर्त्तारमध्वरे for निष्कर्त्तारमध्वरे; तुभ्येदमग्ने for तुभ्यमिदमग्ने; आम्बानां चरुः for नाम्बानां चरुः; अव्याधिनी रुगणः or अव्याधिनीः सुगणाः ॥\n\nThe above discussion is summarised in the following\n\nKarika:- धिसकारे सिचोलोपश्चकाद्धीति प्रयोजनम्, \"This rule is confined to the elision of the सिच् only, for the sake of preserving the स् in चकाद्धि\" ॥  \n\nआशाध्वं तु कथं ? जश्त्वं सकारस्य भविष्यति ॥ \"How then do you form आशाध्वं by the elision of स्?

It thus includes all the _krit_ affixes, and _dhatu_ affixes i. e. affixes which come after a verb and not the _Taddhita_ or the Feminine affixes. This _Vartika_ applies to all the preceding _sutras_ of this sub-division and is of use in the following places.\n\nगिरोऽभोधिर्द्विष्टरां च दृषत्स्थः काष्ठशक्स्थिरः । कुञ्चाघुर्येति मा स्मैषु सत्वादीनि भवांत्विति ॥\n\nSo that in गिरः there should not be the optional ल by (VIII. 2. 21). In अभोधिः, the स् of अभस् is not elided before धि as required by (VIII. 2. 25). In द्विष्टरां the rule (VIII. 2. 27) does not apply. In दृषत्स्थः the rule (VIII. 2. 26) does not apply. In काष्ठशक्स्थिरः the rule (VIII. 2. 29) is non-applicable. In क्रुञ्चा the rule (VIII. 2. 30) does not apply. In धुर्यः (धुरं वहति) there is not lengthening by (VIII. 2. 77). Thus काष्ठशक्स्थाता ॥ Here क् would require to be elided as initial in a consonant, followed by a _jhal_ consonant थ ॥ काष्ठशक् is formed by adding क्विप् to शक् ॥ But according to _Patanjali_, there can be formed no valid word from शक् with क्विप्, a fortiori, no such word can be formed as काष्ठशक्स्थाता (काष्ठशकि तिष्ठति).\n\nIn वास्यर्थम्, काक्यर्थम्, the स् and क् are not elided, because य् is a _Bahiranga_ substitute and _asiddha_, and the word वास्य् काक्य् are not considered as _Pada_, ending in a conjunct consonant.\n\nWhy do we say \"of स् and क्\"?

It is not so, because _Panini_ himself uses this word, in this form, in _sutra_ (III. 2. 59). Or because the rule is confined to सङ् affixes only. Or the root is कुञ्च् without र् and with a penultimate न्, and not ञ् as we find in _Dhatupatha_ कुन्च कौटिल्याल्पी भावयोः (_Bhuadi_ 200). With the elision of न we have निकुचितिः before the क्तिन् affix (VI. 4. 24) कुचितः in Past Participle, and अचोकुन् ॥ In निकुचितम् we cannot have the optional कित् of the _Nishtha_ by (I. 2. 21), because the elision of the penultimate न् by (VI. 4. 24) preceded on the basis of the affix being कित्, thus कुन्च् + क्त = कुच् + त ॥ This elision of न्, will not make the root उदुपधा for the purposes of the application of rule (I. 2. 21), on the maxim सन्निपातलक्षणो विधिरनिमित्तं तद्विघातस्य ॥ In fact, one of the reasons on which this maxim is based, is this very fact, that the elision of न् does not make the root उपधा for the purposes of making the affix non-कित् ॥ The affix क्तिन् takes the augment इट् under (VII. 2. 9) (_vartika_). The word क्रुङ् is formed from this root by क्विन् affix (III. 2. 59): the final च् is first elided by (VIII. 2. 23), and then ञ् is changed to ङ् by (VIII. 2. 62). The rule (VI. 4. 24) thus finds no scope here.\n\nIn this view of the case we say क्रुञ्च् is an irregular form of this root _kunch_, because it is so exhibited in (III. 2. 59). There the _anusvara_ and _parasavarna_ change of this न् to ञ् by (VIII. 3. 24) being considered _asiddha_, there is no palatal ञ्, and hence there is no guttural change.",

For the घ in काष्ठदघ् is substituted ग by (VIII. 2. 39), or क् by (VIII. 4. 56), and द becomes ध by (VIII. 2. 37).\n\nWhy do we say \"of a root beginning with द\"? Observe लेढा, लेढुम्, लेढव्यम्, गुडेलिट् ॥\n\nThe force of the genitive case in धातोः is not to make it in apposition with the word दादेः, but it has the force of denoting a part as related to the whole: so that it means \"the word which begins with द and forms part of a root, for the ह of such a part is substituted घ.\" What does follow from it? The letter घ is substituted in अधोग् also, which begins with अ ॥ For without the above explanation (धातोरवयवो यो दादिशब्दस्तदवयवस्य हकारस्य &c), the घ would have come in examples like मास्म धोक्, without the augment अ, but not where there was the augment अ ॥ Moreover, that it is an अवयवयोगा षष्ठी will appear necessary in _sutra_ (VIII. 2. 37).\n\nIf it has the force of denoting a 'portion or member', how do you explain the forms दोग्धा, दोग्धुम्, for here no portion is taken but the whole word? This will be explained on the maxim of व्यपदेशिवद् भावः \"An operation which affects something on account of some special designation, which for certain reasons attaches to the latter, affects likewise that which stands alone, and to which therefore, just because the reasons for it do not exist, that special designation does not attach\". (व्यपदेशिवद् एकस्मिन्) ॥ Or we may explain the sutra_, by saying 'that root which begins with द् in its original enunciation in _Dhatupatha_'? Thus in original enunciation the root is लिह् not beginning with द ॥ If a Derivative root be formed from it like दामलिह्य (दामलिहमिच्छति = दामलिह्यति), it is a root which begins with द; the ह of this Denominative root, however, will not be changed to घ, for it is not a root of _upadesa_. Therefore, when we add क्विप् to this root, we get दामलिट् by (VIII. 2. 31), and not दामलिक् ॥",

The others would not have got घ but for this _sutra_.\n\nThese roots belong to _Radhadi_ sub-class of _Divadi_ _gana_: and are taught there in this very order (_Divadi_ 89-91). By belonging to _Radhadi_ sub-division, the इट् is optional (VII. 2. 45). Instead of making the _sutra_ वाद्रुहादीनाम्, this longer formation of the aphorism indicates that the rule applies to यङ्लुक् also, as दोध्रुक् or दोध्रुट् ॥ See (VII. 1. 6), for if the roots were taught not specifically but by गण, then the rule would not apply to _yan_ _luk_.",

It would have shortened the processes of transformation, had only द been ordained in the _sutra_, instead of ध; but the ordaining of ध is for the purposes of (VIII. 2. 40), by which there should be ध for the participial त &c, in नद्धम्, and that there should not be the change of this _Nishtha_ त into म by (VIII. 2. 42). Thus नध् + त = नध् + ध (VIII. 2. 40) नद्धम् (VIII. 4. 53) But had the substitute been द, we should have नद् + त = नन्नं by (VIII. 2. 42).",

Making this separate substitute, is for the sake of indicating that the rule (VIII. 2. 40), does not apply here. For had (VIII. 2. 40), still applied, the substitute ध of the last _sutra_ would have been enough. The त substitute, however, would have been the best.\n\nThe word झलि is understood here.

The word शब्दप्राट् is formed by क्विप्, there is lengthening and no vocalisation.\n\nThe roots राज् and भ्राज् are never followed by a _jhal_ beginning affix, because such affixes will always take इट् augment. These roots are, therefore, mentioned here, for the sake of the change of their ज् to ष्, when at the end of a word. Some, however, form nouns like राष्टिः, भ्राष्टिः with क्तिन् affix from these roots by (III. 3. 94), _vartika_, and इट् augment is prevented by (VII. 2. 9).\n\nOf roots ending in छ we have प्रच्छ :- प्रष्टा, प्रष्टुम्, प्रष्टव्यम्,  शब्दप्राट् ॥ According to one view, the letter छ should not be mentioned in this _sutra_: for by (VI. 4. 19), छ is always changed to श, and this श will be changed to ष by the present _sutra_. Others hold, that the change of छ to श by (VI. 4. 19) is confined before कित् or ङित् affixes, and therefore the mention of छ is necessary in this _sutra_; moreover the ष् substitution here, and the  श् substitution in (VI. 4. 19). refer to the conjunct letter च्छ (with the augment तुक्). For if it were not so, then छ alone being changed to ष्, the त् of तुक् would be changed to ट्, and we should have पृट्ष्टः instead of  पृष्टः ॥\n\nOf roots ending in श् we have लिश् :- लेष्टा, लेष्टुम्, लेष्टव्यम्, लिट्; विश् :- वेष्टा, वेष्टुम्, वेष्टव्यम्, विट् ॥",

The substitutes are four भ, घ, ड and ध, and their respective _sthanins_ are also four, i. e. ब, ग, ड and द; so that ढ is the substitute of ड; but, as a matter of fact, ड never so stands at the beginning of a monosyllable, and so there is no ढ substitution.",
    "82038": "The word दध is taken in the _sutra_ as the reduplicated form of धा दधाति and not the root दध धारणे of _Bhuadi_ class, as शप् intervenes there. By the word च we draw in the words स and ध्व ॥ Thus धत्तः, धत्थः, धत्स, धत्स्व, धध्वम् ॥ By the express injunction of this _sutra_, the elided अ is not considered as _sthanivat_. The last _sutra_ could not have applied to दध for two reasons. Ist. It does not begin with a बश् letter, for the real reduplicate is धध, and ह is merely a substitute, and is considered _asiddha_. 2ndly. The form दध does not end in a _jhash_ consonant, but in a vowel अ, and though this अ is elided before these affixes, yet the _lopa_ would be _sthanivat_. Hence the necessity of च in this _sutra_. See coutra, the _vartika_ in _Mahabhashya_.\n\nThe word झलि is understood here, and so also झषन्तस्य; and there can be no affix, but begins with त or थ, that can come after दध् ॥ Why do we employ then the words 'before त and थ'? Had we not used these, the _sutra_ would have referred to स and ध्व only, as being in immediate proximity, and the च draws them in. According to _Padamanjari_ the words तथोश्च could have been dispensed with: for before स् and ध्व, the ध change would have taken place by the last _sutra_, whilst by this _sutra_, the same change would have taken place before all other झल्-beginning affixes, and such affixes that can come after दध् are त or थ-beginning affixes.\n\nThe word _jhash_ is understood here also, therefore the rule applies to दध then only, when it assumes the form of दध्, by the elision of आ; and hence not here दधाति ॥",

For had the root क्षि with short इ been meant, the form would have been क्षेः ॥\n\nAnswer:- The _dhatu_ imitative noun though taking इयङ् (VI. 4. 77) as in क्षियः, includes the _dhatu_ ending in short इ also, as in _sutra_ (VI. 4. 59), (VI. 4. 60) where क्षि ending in short इ is taken.\n\nQuestion: If a root ending in short vowel may also be indicated by an imitative name, declined with the इयङ् augment, then why is the root जि exhibited in _sutra_ (I. 3. 19) as जेः instead of जियः i. e, the _sutra_ ought to have been वि पराभ्यां जियः and not वि पराभ्यां जेः ?\n\nAnswer:- Here the word जि is not used as a _dhatu_-imitative word, there is no intention here to denote the verbal idea of the particular act connoted by the root जि; on the contrary, it simply expresses the mere form जि ॥",

Therefore we have प्रतिशीनः with न change.\n\nThe word स्पर्श is a _guna_ word formed by घञ्, and denotes the particular _guna_ or sensation to be sensed through the organ of touch. In this sense it is derived from the root स्पृश संस्पर्शने ॥ It also denotes a disease, derived from स्पर्श उपतापे ॥ There is nothing to show, what स्पर्श is meant in the _sutra_. Explanation is the only refuge here.",

Observe, निर्वातो वातः, निर्वातं वातेन ॥\n\nIn the sentences निर्वाणः प्रदीपो वातेन, निर्वाणोऽग्निर्वातेन, the न change has taken place, because the location of the verb वा is in the प्रदीप and अग्नि, and not in the वात, which is merely an Instrument.

But when _samprasarana_ is once made, the root no longer has a semi-vowel and so there remains no occasion for the application of (VIII. 2. 43). See (VI. 1. 23) for vocalisation.",

The same change takes place before क्तवतु also, as फुल्लवान् ॥\n\nThe affix त् is elided after the roots क्षीब्, कृश् and उत् -लाघ्, and the augment इट् is prohibited; this is the irregularity in क्षीबः, कृशः and उल्लाघः ॥\n\nWhy do we say when not preceded by a Preposition? Observe प्रफुल्लाः सुमनसः, प्रक्षीबितः, प्रकृशितः, प्रोल्लाघितः ॥ In the case of लाघ्, prepositions other than उत् are prohibited.\n\nOr the augment इट् is added, and then इत् is elided from क्षीबितः &c. See (VIII. 2. 3) _vartika_\n\nVart:- The forms उत्फुल्लः and संफुल्लः should be enumerated. . Here त is changed to ल, though the root has taken a Preposition.\n\nIn the word परिकृशः, the word परि is not a Preposition with regard to the verb कृश्; परिगतः कृशः = परिकृशः ॥ So that परि is _upasarga_ of the verb गतः understood, hence we have the form कृशः ॥",

The condition of being a debtor is आधमर्ण्यम् or \"indebtedness:\"\n\nIf this is so, then the word उत्तमर्णः 'creditor' cannot be formed? This is no valid objection.

    "82062": "The word पदस्य is understood here. The word क्विन्प्रत्यय is a _Bahuvrihi_ meaning 'that stem which has _kvin_ as its affix.' For the final consonant of such a stem, a guttural is substituted. As घृतस्पृक् (III. 2. 58), हलस्पृक्, मन्त्रस्पृक् ॥\n\nThe _sutra_ could have been क्विनः कुः; the word प्रत्यय is used in the _sutra_ to show the _Bahuvrihi_ compound; so that the व् of क्विन् may not be changed to a guttural. Moreover this _Bahuvrihi_ also indicates that the roots which take the क्विन् affix, change their final to a guttural before other affixes than क्विन् ॥ Thus the roots सृज् and दृश् take क्विन् to form स्रक् and दृक् nouns by (III. 2. 59), (III. 2. 60). The guttural change will take place even when these roots are declined as verbs: as, मानो अस्राक् मानो अद्राक्, where अस्राक् and अद्राक् are the Aorist of सृज् and दृश् ॥ The augment अट् is not elided, though the मा is added (VI. 4. 75) as a Vedic diversity. The ईट् augment also does not take place as a Vedic irregularity. The augment अम् is added by (VI. 1. 58), and the vowel is lengthened by _Vriddhi_ by (VII. 2. 3). Thus अट् + सृज् + सिच् + तिप् = अस्रज् (VI. 1. 58) = अस्राक् (VII. 2. 3) and (VIII. 2. 62). Otherwise it would have been ष by (VIII. 2. 36). So also in दृग्भ्यां, दृग्भिः, the श् is changed to a guttural, though the noun दृश् is a क्विप् formed noun and not formed by क्विन्; and this is so, because the verb दृश् does take क्विन् also.\n\nObjection:- If this be so, there ought to be guttural change in रज्जुसृड्भ्यां from the root सृज् with क्विप्? Answer:- The guttural change however in not desired here.\n\nIn gutturalisation, ज is changed to ग, and श to ख, which both become क by वावसाने (VIII. 4. 56)",

The word अवयाज् is also formed by ण्विन् (III. 2. 72). Thus the three words श्वेतवाह्, पुरोडाश् and अवयाज् are formed. These words take the affix डस् before the _Pada_-terminations (See _Vartika_ to (III. 2. 71)). After having taken डस्, the above forms अवयाः &c., are made in Nominative singular irregularly.\n\nWhy is this _nipatana_, when रु would have come by the last sutra_ and the lengthening would have taken place by (VI. 4. 14), of the words अवयस्, श्वेतवस् and पुरोडस्? They are so exhibited here, for making them long in the Vocative singular also. For they could not have been lengthened in the Vocative singular, because (VI. 4. 14) does not apply to it.

The रु-called र is changed to उ by (VI. 1. 113), the ordinary र is not so changed.\n\nObjection:- In अहर्ददाति and अहर्भुङ्क्ते the case-ending is elided after अहन्, and so by _Pratyaya_-_lakshana_, we may say that there is a case-ending here also ? Answer:- This is not so, because of the following maxim अहो रविधौ लुमता लुप्ते प्रत्यय लक्षणं न भवति ॥ The rule of _pratya_ _lakshana_ does not apply to the substitution of र for the final of अहन् when the affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्. Therefore, this अहन् is not considered to be followed by सुप् or case-affix. But where an affix is elided by using the word लोप, there the rule of _Pratyaya_-_lakshana_ does apply to अहन् ॥ As हे दीर्घाहोऽत्र, हे दीर्घाहो निदाघ. (VIII. 2. 7).

    "82072": "The _anuvritti_ of स् is understood here from (VIII. 2. 66). It qualifies वस् only, and not the rest. That is, when the word formed by the affix वस् ends with स्, such स् is replaced by द ॥ For a word formed by वस् does not sometimes end in स्, and in those cases the rule will not apply. As स्रंस् and ध्वंस् always end in स्, there is no necessity of qualifying these by the स् of (VIII. 2. 66). अनडुह् ends in ह् and so स् cannot qualify it.\n\nThus विद्वद्भ्याम्, विद्वद्भिः, पपिवद्भ्याम्, पपिवद्भिः with वस् affix. स्रंस् :- उखास्रद्भ्याम्, उखास्रद्भिः ॥ (VII. 1. 70) and (III. 2. 36). ध्वंस् – पर्णध्वद्भ्याम्, पर्णध्वद्भिः ॥ अनडुह् – अनडुद्भ्याम्, अनडुद्भिः ॥\n\nBut when a वस् formed word does not end in स्, the rule does not apply. As विद्वान्, पपिवान् ॥ Here न् is not changed to द् ॥\n\nIn the case of वस्, the द is ordained, before any other rule manifests itself; thus in विद्वद्भ्यां this द debars रु; so why should it not debar the rule relating to the elision of the final in विद्वान् also ? This rule sets aside रु, but it does not, however, over-rule the elision-rule, because it is not directly connected with this change.\n\nWhy in अनड्वान् the न् is not changed to द्? By the very fact, that नुम् is ordained (विधान-सामर्थ्यात्), this न् will not be changed to द् : otherwise नुम् rule would become superfluous; for it would be easier to say let ह् be changed to द्, and we should get the form अनड्वाद् by this rule without नुम् ॥\n\nObjection:- Is this be so, that the नुम् is not changed to द, because of giving it a scope, then in अनड्वान् अत्र, this नुम् should not be changed into रु by (VIII. 3. 9)?\n\nAnswer:- No; the maxim is that that rule is set aside, with regard to which a particular rule would become useless, if not so over-ruled: but that rule is not set aside which is only an occasion for the application of another rule (यं विधिं प्रति उपदेशोऽनर्थकः सविधिर्बाध्यते, यस्य तु विधेर्निमित्तमेव नासौ बाध्यते) ॥ With regard to द change, the नुम् _vidhi_ is useless (_anarthaka_), with regard to रु change, it is merely an occasion.\n\nThe word पदस्य is understood here also, so the change does not take place in विद्वांसौ and विद्वांसः ॥",

Thus हूर्छा, हूर्छिता, मूर्छा, मूर्छिता, तूर्वी, तूर्विता, धूर्वी, धूर्विता ॥\n\nThe र् or व् must be followed by a consonant. Therefore not here: as, चिरि, जिरि are roots having a penultimate र, which however is followed by a vowel. Therefore we have चिरिणोति, जिरिणोति ॥\n\nQuestion:- Why there is not lengthening in रिर्यतुः, रिर्युः or विव्यतुः, विव्युः Perfect, forms derived from the roots रि गतौ and वी गतौ &c? Here the इ of the _abhyasa_ required lengthening, and it would not be shortened, as it is _asiddha_.\n\nAnswer:- The यण् substitute of इ here by (VI. 4. 82), is treated as _sthanivat_, to इ, and therefore, the र् or व् is considered as not to be followed by a consonant, and hence there is no lengthening. Another reason is, that the यण् substitute is taught in _angadhikara_ (VI. 4. 82), and depends upon the affix, and is consequently _Bahiranga_, with regard to this rule of lengthening which is _antaranga_. Hence यणादेशः is considered as _asiddha_. Therefore र् and व् are not followed by a consonant (for य् is not considered as such for the above reasons).\n\nSimilarly in चतुर्यितृ formed with तृच् affix from the Denominative (क्यच्) root चतुर्य ॥ Here इट् is added before तृच् as चतुर्य + इ + तृ and then अ is elided, चतुर्य् + इ + तृ ॥ Here the elision of अ is a _Bahiranga_ process, and therefore, र् is not here really penultimate, and so there is no lengthening of the vowel.\n\nIn प्रतिदीव्ना (Instrumental singular) there is lengthening by (VIII. 2. 77). To the root प्रति-दिव् is added कनिन् by _Unadi_ I. 156, and we have प्रतिदिवन् ॥ To this is added टा (Instrumental affix), as प्रतिदिवन् + आ, and अ is elided by (VI. 4. 134), and we get प्रतिदीव्ना ॥ The lengthening takes place here, the elision of अ is not considered here as _sthanivat_, and so व् becomes penultimate. In fact, here we apply the maxim that a _lopa_ substitute of a vowel is not to be considered as _sthanivat_ when a rule of lengthening is to be applied (See (I. 1. 58)).\n\nQuestion:- Well, let it not be _sthanivat_, but the elision by (VI. 4. 134), depends upon a case-affix, and is _Bahiranga_, and therefore _asiddha_ for the purposes of this rule which is _antaranga_: and so therefore, there would be no lengthening?\n\nAnswer:- The maxim of असिद्ध बहिरङ्गमन्तरङ्ग should not be applied here: because it is an _anitya_ rule.\n\nThe word जिव्रिः is formed by the _Unadi_ affix क्रिन् added to the root वॄ (जिर्), the र् being changed to व (_Unadi_ V. 49). So also किरिः and गिरिः are formed by the _Unadi_ affix कि added to कॄ and गॄ (_Unadi_ IV. 143). The Genitive Dual of which is किर्योः and गिर्योः ॥ There is no lengthening in जिव्रिः, किर्योः and गिर्योः, on the maxim that the _Unadi_ formed words are primitive words and not Derivative; and so the rules of etymological changes do not apply to them (उणादयोऽव्युत्पन्नानि प्रातिपदिकानि) ॥",
    "82079": "Thus धुर्यः (धुरं वहति (IV. 4. 77) or धुरि साधुः) ॥ Similarly कुर्यात्, छुर्यात् ॥ The latter is Benedictive of छुर् छेदने ॥  \n\nWhy have we qualified the word भ by saying that it must end in र् or व्? Observe प्रतिदीव्ना, प्रतिदीव्ने ॥ For here the stem which ends in व् is not-_Bha_, and the stem which is _Bha_ does not end in व् but in न् ॥",
    "82080": "Karika :-\nअदसोद्रे पृथङ् मुत्वं के चिदिच्छन्ति लत्ववत् ।\nके चिदन्त्यसदेशस्य नेत्येकेऽसेर्हि दृश्यते ॥\n\nThus अमुम्, अमू, अमून्, अमुना, अमुभ्याम् ॥ अद is substituted for अदस् before a case-ending by (VII. 2. 102), which in Feminine becomes अदा ॥ By the present _sutra_ read with (I. 1. 50), अमु is substituted for अद and अमू for अदा ॥ The उ which replaces one-_matra_ vowel will be one-_matra_ उ i. e. short उ, and the उ which replaces a two-_matra_ vowel will be a two-_matra_ उ i. e. long ऊ ॥ See (I. 1. 50).\n\nWhy do we say, \"not ending in स\"? Observe अद इच्छति = अदस्यति ॥ Objection:- How can this be a valid example, as the word पदस्य is understood here, and अदस् before the affix क्य is not a _pada_ (I. 4. 15)? Answer:- This indicates that the मु change takes place, even when अदस् is not a _pada_. As अमुमुय ॥\n\nVart:- It should rather be stated that the rule applies to that अदस् which has no ओ, or स् or र् ॥ So that the prohibition may apply to अदोऽत्र, अदः कुलम् ॥ The _visarjaniya_ being considered as _asiddha_, this word is considered as ending in र् ॥\n\nIn order to apply the prohibition to ओ and र् also, some explain the _sutra_ thus :- अः सेर्यस्य सोयमसिः, यत्र सकारस्य अकारः क्रियते ॥ \"The word असिः in the _sutra_ is a _Bahuvrihi_, and means that in which अ is substituted for स\" ॥ The _sutra_ is thus confined to the form अद derived by changing the स् into अ by (VII. 2. 102): and not to any other अद ॥\n\nWhen अदस् takes the final-substitute अद्रि by (VI. 3. 92), how is this rule to be applied ? Thus by (III. 2. 59), the root अञ्च् takes क्विन् ॥ We compound it with अदस्, as अदाऽञ्चति ॥ अदस् + अञ्च + क्विन् = अद् + अद्रि + अञ्च् + क्विन् (VI. 3. 92) = अदद्र्यच् (VI. 4. 24). Now there are three views, (1) the द of अद, and द्र, of अद्रि are both changed to मु by the present _sutra_; (2), the first द is not changed, but only द्र; (3) none is changed. Thus we have (1) अमुमुयङ् (VII. 1. 70), (VI. I. 68), (VIII. 2. 23) and (VII. 2. 62), अमुमुयञ्चौ, अमुमुयञ्चः ॥ (2) Secondly, अदमुयङ् अदमुयञ्चौ, अदमुयञ्चः ॥ (3) Lastly अदद्र्यङ्, अदद्र्यञ्चौ, अदद्र्यञ्चः ॥ The above verse summarises this:\n\n\"Some ordain that मु should come separately for both _adas_ and _adri_, as there is double ल (in चलीक्लृप्यते); others would have मु only for the last portion which stands in proximity to the final, (i, e. for द्र); while a third class would have nowhere, because they explain असेः of the _sutra_, by confining it to: (VII. 2. 102).\" The first class interpret असेः by \"that form of अदस् which has no स्\"; and they do not apply the maxim अनन्त्यविकारेऽन्त्यसदेशस्य कार्यं भवति \"when a modification is ordained with regard to some thing which is not final, the operation takes place on that only which is in proximity to the final.\" The second class apply this maxim and make मु change only for द्र which stands in proximity to the final; while the last class interpret the word असेः in a different way altogether (अः अस्य सकारस्य सोऽयम् असिः) ॥  \n\nWhy do we say दात् 'for the vowel after द'? Observe अमुया, अमुयोः, the final य as not changed to उ ॥",
    "82081": "Thus अमी for अदे (or अते) अमीभिः for अदेभिः, अमीभ्यः for अदेभ्यः, अमीषाम् for अदेषाम्, अमीषु for अदेषु ॥ द is changed to त in अते &c.\n\nThe word बहुवचने in the _sutra_ does not mean the technical बहुवचन; for that would have made the _sutra_ have this sense \"when the affixes of the Plural number follow\". In that case, we could not get the form अमी where no plural affix follows. Hence we have translated it, by saying when plurality is to be denoted.",
    "82082": "This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. All the three words i.e. \"the last vowel (टि) of a sentence\", \"_pluta_\" and \"acute\" - are to be supplied in the subsequent aphorisms to complete the sense, upto the end of this _Pada_. Whatever we shall treat hereafter will refer to the final vowel (टि) in a sentence, and it will get the _pluta_ lengthening and acute accent. Thus (VIII. 2. 83), says \"In answer to a salutation, but not when it is addressed to a _Sudra_\". We must supply the present aphorism to complete the meaning :-\"In answer to a salutation, the last vowel of a sentence becomes _pluta_ and gets the acute accent, but not when it is addressed to a _Sudra_\". As अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं । भो आयुष्मानेधि देवदत्ता꣡ ३ ॥\n\nOne _adhikara_ sets aside another _adhikara_, this is the general maxim. Will therefore the _adhikara_ of the present aphorism set aside the _adhikara_ of the word पदस्य (VIII. 1. 16)? No, the _adhikara_ of पदस्य has not ceased, though latent. Otherwise in भवन्तौ &c. the न् would be required to be changed to रु by (VIII. 3. 7). But it does not become so, because पदस्य manifests itself there.\n\nThe employment of the word \"_vakya_\" would not debar the _anuvritti_ of पद, for the final vowel of a sentence, will a fortiori be the final vowel of a word (_pada_), then what is the use of employing the word वाक्यस्य in this _sutra_ ?\n\nThe word वाक्य is employed in the _sutra_, so that a word which is not the last word of a sentence, will not get the _pluta_ and acute. Had the _sutra_ been पदस्य टेः &c. then all the words of a sentence would become _pluta_ and acute in the final. The word टि is employed to indicate that the final vowel becomes _pluta_ and acute, though the word may end in a consonant. As अग्निचि꣡३त् ॥ Had टि not been used, the rule would have applied to words ending in vowels only, and not to words ending in consonants.",
    "82083": "The word अभिवादन means \"respectful salutation of a superior or elder by an inferior or junior for the sake of obtaining his blessing. It consists of three acts 1. rising from the seat, 2. touching of the feet, 3. the uttering of the formula of salutation\". The word प्रत्यभिवादन means, the blessing given by the superior or elder in answer to such salutation. In giving utterance to such blessing, the last vowel of the final word gets _udatta_ and acute, provided that, such blessing is not pronounced on a _Sudra_.\n\nThus अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं is said by _Devadatta_ to his _Guru_. The latter says भो आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्ता꣡ ३ ॥ \"_O_ _Devadatta_ ! be thou long-lived\".\n\nWhy do we say when not referring to a _Sudra_? Observe अभिवादये तुषजकोऽहं is said by a _Sudra_. In reply to this the _Guru_ replies भो आयुष्मान् एधि तुषजक !\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated with regard to women also. As अभिवादये गार्ग्यहं is said by _Gargi_. To this the _Guru_ replies :- भो आयुष्मती भव गार्गि ! ॥\n\nVart:- Some would have this prohibition where a detractor or an arrogant person is addressed. So long as one's arrogance or ridicule does not become manifest, there is prolation. But when one comes to know that he is my detractor, and is really ridiculing me by a show of respect; then the reply is not a blessing, but is, in fact, a curse. Thus अभिवादये स्थाल्यहं भोः, is uttered by the detractor; and the _Guru_ understanding the word _Sthalin_ to be the Proper Name of the person, replies आयुष्मान् एधि स्थालिन् ३ ॥ Then the detractor says, _Sthalin_ is not my Proper Name, but an adjective, like _dandin_, viz. he who has a स्थाल or cooking pot. The _Guru_, believing this to be true, again replies, आयुष्मान् एधि स्थालिन् but without prolation, because the word is not a Proper Noun. The other then says \"_O_ Sir, it is not my epithet, it is my Proper Name\". The _Guru_ now comes to learn that he is being laughed at, and so gets angry and says असूयकस्त्वं जाल्म ! न प्रत्यभिवादनमर्हसि; भिद्यस्वं वृषल स्थालिन् ! ॥ Here it is a curse, as well as a pun : i. e. \"burst thou, _O _sinner ! like unto a cooking pot (_sthalin_ = _sthali_-_vat_).\n\n_Ishti_:- This prolation takes place there only, where the Proper Noun _Gotra_ &c. with which the salutation was made, is employed by the _Guru_ at the end of the sentence; and not where the position of the Proper Name &c. is different. Therefore not here, देवदत्त कुशल्यसि; देवदत्त आयुष्मान् एधि, for here the word _Devadatta_ is not used at the end of a sentence.\n\nVart:- The prolation is optional, when भोः follows such Proper Name, or when the Person addressed is a _Kshatriya_ or a _Vaishya_. As भो अभिवादये देवदत्तोऽहं ॥  Reply (1) आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्त भोः ३ or (2) आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्त भोः ॥ So also when a _Kshatriya_ is addressed, as अभिवादये इन्द्रवर्म्माहं भोः, Reply (1) आयुष्मान् एधि इन्द्रवर्म्मन् ३ or (2) आयुष्मान् एधि इन्द्रवर्म्मन् ॥_Vaishya_: अभिवादये इन्द्रपालितोऽहं भोः ॥ _Guru_ : आयुष्मानेधि इन्द्रपालित ३ or आयुष्मानेधि इन्द्रपालित ! ॥",

Thus आगच्छ भो माणवक देवदत्ता ३ ॥ आगच्छ भो माणवक यज्ञदत्ता ३ ॥ The word 'distance' is a relative term, and is not fixed at what distance there should be prolation. The prolation however takes place, when a voice is to be raised, in order that the sound may reach the person. That distance upto which the voice can be heard without raising its pitch and without any special effort, need not be considered as \"distance\" for the purposes of this _sutra_.\n\nThe word हूत here includes, 'addressing in general', and not only 'calling'. Thus there is prolation here also सक्तून् पिब देवदत्ता ३, पलायस्व देवदत्ता ३ ॥ This _pluta_ sentence becomes _eka_-_sruti_ by (I. 2. 33).\n\nWhy do we say \"from a distance\"?

With the exception of ऋ, for every heavy vowel, though it may not be the final vowel of the vocative word, and for the final vowel also, but only one at a time, there is _pluta_ substitution, in the opinion of Eastern Grammarians. Thus हे दे꣡३वदत्त or देवद꣡३त्त or देवदत्त꣡ ३ ॥ Similarly with य꣡३ज्ञदत्त, यज्ञद꣡३त्त or यज्ञदत्त꣡ ३ ॥\n\nWhy do we say गुरोः \"of a prosodially long vowel\"? So that the अ of य and ज्ञ in _Devadatta_ and _Yajnadatta_ may not be prolated, for this अ is short.\n\nWhy do we say अनृतः \"with the exception of ऋ\"? Observe कृष्णमि꣡३त्र, कृष्णमित्र꣡ ३, but never कृ꣡३ष्णमित्र ॥\n\nThe word एकैकस्य shows that the prolation should not be simultaneous, but of one at a time; not दे३वद३त्त३ ॥\n\nThe word प्राचाम् \"in the opinion of Eastern Grammarians\" is used for the sake of creating option. So in one alternative, there is no prolation at all.\n\nAs आयुष्मान् एधि देवदत्त ॥ Thus the present _sutra_, makes (VIII. 2. 83) and (VIII. 2. 84), optional _sutras_. This also is an authority for the following dictum of _Patanjali_\"सर्व एव प्लुतः साहसमनिच्छता विभाषा कर्त्तव्यः\" (_Mahabhashya_ (VIII. 2. 92) Commentary). Thus all rules relating to Prolation become optional. In short, the word प्राचाम् should be read in all rules regarding prolation, and thus without doing violence (_sahasa_) to grammatical authority, one may have optional _pluta_ everywhere.",

    "82105": "The word '_padasya_' is understood here: and so also the word '_svarita_'. The end-vowel of a word which is not the last word in a sentence, as well as of the last word, becomes _svarita_ and _pluta_, when a question is asked, or a fact is narrated. In fact, all the words of a sentence become _svarita_ and _pluta_ hereby.\n\nThus in questioning we have:- आगमा॑३: पूर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् अग्नि भूतां॑३इ or पटा३उ ॥ Thus all words have become _svarita_ and _pluta_. The final word would, in one alternative, become _anudatta_ also, by (VIII. 2. 100), as shown under that _sutra_. The force of the word अपि in the _sutra_, is to make the final word also _svarita_, and thus this _sutra_ makes (VIII. 2. 100) an optional _sutra_ with regard to question.\n\nIn _akhyana_ or narration, there is no other rule, which is debarred by this. Therefore there, all words become _svarita_ and _pluta_ necessarily, by the force of this _sutra_. Thus अगमा॑३न् पुर्वा॑३न् ग्रामा॑३न् भोः॑३ ॥\n\nAnother view of this _sutra_ is that the word अपि applies only to _akhyana_, so that in _akhyana_ all words become _svarita_. But in _prasna_, the final word will not become _svarita_, but _anudatta_ necessarily by (VIII. 2. 100). According to this view, this _sutra_ does not ordain option. This view is not adopted by _Kasika_, or _Padamanjari_ or _Siddhanta_ _Kaumudi_.",
    "82106": "The _pluta_ ordained by (VIII. 2. 84) &c. when applied to ऐ or औ, cause the prolation of the last element of these diphthongs namely of इ or उ ॥ The word प्लुतौ in the _sutra_ is Nominative dual of प्लुत, and the aphorism literally means \"इ and उ are _pluta_ of the diphthongs ऐ and औ\" ॥\n\nThus ऐ३तिकायन, औ३पगव ॥\n\nThe letters ऐ and औ are compound letters or diphthongs consisting of अ + इ and अ + उ ॥ In making the _pluta_ of these, the question arises, should both अ and इ (or उ) be prolated, or only the last element, or the first only. The present _sutra_ answers that doubt. If in the analysis of these letters, अ be taken as having one _matra_ (or moras), and इ and उ one _matra_, then the _pluta_ इ and उ will have two _matras_, so that the whole _pluta_ ऐ and औ will have three _matras_. In fact, the word प्लुत is used here as a Past Participle of प्लु, having the force of a verb; and इदुतौ प्लुतौ means इदुतौ प्लवेते i.e. वृद्धिं गच्छतः, i.e. इ and उ are lengthened. And इ and उ are lengthened to that extent, so as to make ऐ and औ of three _matras_. Thus when अ + इ and अ +  उ each has one _matra_, then the _pluta_ of इ and उ will have two _matras_ as we have said before. But when अ + इ (ए) and अ + उ (ओ) are considered to have अ half _matra_, and इ and उ one _matra_ and a half, then इ and उ are made _pluta_, so as to have two and a half (2 1\/2)_matras_ each, thus the whole of ऐ and औ, has still three _matras_. In fact, the definition of _pluta_ is, that it is a vowel which has three _matras_: so that we should so prolate the vowel as to make it have three _matras_.\n\nBut according to _Patanjali_, this _pluta_ of ऐ and औ has four _matras_. Thus अ + इ and अ + उ each has one _matra_. The _pluta_ of इ and उ will have three _matras_. Thus अ + इ३ and अ + उ३. or the whole has four _matras_. According to this view a vowel may have four _matras_ also.",

I. 3. 14. 7).\n\nThis _pluta_ आ is _udatta_, _anudatta_ or _svarita_, according to the particular rule which has been applied, i. e. at the end of a question it is _anudatta_ or _svarita_, and every where else, _udatta_. The इ and उ are of course, always _udatta_ : because the _anuvritti_ of _udatta_ is current here.\n\nWhy do we restrict this sutra_ to the above-mentioned four rules? Observe विष्णुभूते विष्णुभूते३ घातयिष्यामि त्वा आगच्छ भो माणवक विष्णुभूते ॥\n\nIn fact, the present _sutra_ being confined to the above-mentioned four rules, the words अदूराद्धूते in the _sutra_, are redundant: and should not have been used. Moreover the word पदान्त should have been used in the _sutra_, for it applies to diphthongs at the end of a _pada_. Therefore, not here, भद्रं करोषि गौरिति ॥ Here गौ before the _sarvanamasthana_ affix सु is not a _Pada_ (I. 4. 17).\n\nWhy do we say 'when it is not a _Pragrhya_'? Observe शोभने खलु स्थःखट्वे३ ॥\n\nVart:- This peculiar modification of _pluta_ vowel takes place in the Vocative case in the Vedas. As अग्ना३इ पत्नीवा३: सजूर्देवेन त्वष्ट्रा सोमं पिब ॥ Here by no other rule, the Vocative would have become prolated.",

Observe अग्ना३ इ इन्द्रम्, पटा३उ उदकम् in _Pada_ _Patha_.\n\nThis _sutra_ is made, because इ and उ being _pluta_-modifications are considered as _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 1) for the purposes of इको यणचि (VI. 1. 77). But supposing that some how or other, these इ and उ be considered _siddha_, still the present rule is necessary to prevent their lengthening before a homogeneous vowel (VI. 1. 101), or their retaining their form unchanged by (VI. 1. 127). If it be said, that these rules (VI. 1. 101), and (VI. 1. 127), would not apply, because of the _Vartika_ इकः प्लुतपूर्वस्य सवर्णदीर्घ बाधनार्थे यणादेशो वक्तव्यः (_Vartika_ to (VI. 1. 77)); still the present _sutra_ ought to be made, in order to prevent यण् accent (VIII. 2. 4).\n\nKarika:- Question: Could not this have been accomplished by the यणादेश of (VI. 1. 77), that the _Acharya_ has taught this separate य् and व् substitution ?\n\nAnswer:- If you say that _pluta_ is _siddha_ in the vowel _sandhi_ rules, because of the _jnapaka_ in _sutra_ (VI. 1. 125), then still this rule is necessary in order to prevent the lengthening of (VI. I. 101), and the _Sakala_ rule (VI. 1. 127).\n\nQuestion:- But those two rules (VI. 1. 101), and (VI. 1. 127), have already been debarred by the _Vartika_ which ordains that यणादेश takes place of such a vowel following a _pluta_ (See _vartika_ to (VI. 1. 77)), what is then the necessity of the present _sutra_ ?\n\nAnswer:- The necessity of the present _sutra_ is to prevent the यण-accent of (VIII. 2. 4).\n\nAccording to one view, the _vartika_ under (VI. 1. 77), refers to those vowels which are not _pluta_-elements, like the present इ and उ, but which are independent vowels following after a _pluta_ vowel.

    "83001": "The word संहितायाम् is understood here. A word ending in the affix मत् or वस्, changes its final त् or स् into र्, in the _Chhandas_, in the Vocative singular. Thus मत् :- इन्द्र॑ मरुत्व इह पा॑हि सोम॒॒म् (_Rig_. III. 51. 7) हरिवो मेदिनं त्वा ॥ Here मरुत्वः is Vocative Singular of मरुत्वत् and हरिवः of हरिवत्, meaning \"he who is possessed of _Maruts_ or _Hari_ horses\". The म् of मत् is changed to व by (VIII. 2. 103); (VIII. 2. 15). The base मरुत् before this termination is _Bha_ by (I. 4. 19). The affix सु (nominative singular) is elided by (VI. I. 68); the त् is elided by (VIII. 2. 23), and the न् (of नुम् (VII. I. 70)) is changed to र् by this _sutra_. So also इन्द्रायाहि तूतुजानः उपब्रह्माणि हरिवः (_Rig_. I. 3. 6).\n\nWith वस् :- मीढ्व॑स्तो॒॒काय॒॒ तन॑याय मृळ (_Rig_. II. 33. 14), इन्द्रसाह्वः ॥ See (VI. I. 12), for the formation of मीढ्वान्, साह्वान् with क्वसु ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'of मत् and वस्'? Observe ब्रह्मन् स्तोष्यामः ॥ Why do we say in the Vocative Singular? Observe य एवं विद्वानग्निमादत्ते ॥ Why do we say in the _Chhandas_? Observe हे गोमन्, हे पपिवन् ॥\n\nVart:- The affix वन् should also be enumerated. The affixes क्वनिप् and वनिप् are both meant here. Its final is also changed to रु in the Vocative Singular. As यस्त्वायन्तं वसुना प्रातरित्वः ॥ The word प्रातरित्वन् is formed by adding क्वनिप् to the root इ (इण्) preceded by प्रातः ॥ See (III. 2. 75). The तुक् is added by (VI. I. 71).\n\nVart:- The finals of भवत्, भगवत् and अघवत् are changed to रु, optionally in the secular as well as the sacred literature, and the syllable अव् of these words is changed to ओ ॥ This is a general rule, applying both in the Vedas and the _Bhasha_. Thus भवत् – हे भोः or हे भवन् ॥ भगवत् – हे भगोः or हे भगवन् ॥ अघवत् – हे अघोः or हे अघवन् ॥ Or these words भोः भगोः and अघोः are so irregularly formed by the _acharya_ himself in (VII. 3. 17). These are found in other numbers than the Vocative Singular, as भो देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तौ, भो देवदत्तयज्ञदत्तविष्णुमित्राः ॥ It is found in connection with Feminine nouns also, as भो ब्राह्मणि ॥\n\nThe _adhikara_ of the word संहितायां does not exert any apparent influence in this _sutra_. It however has influence in those subsequent _sutras_, where the change in one word is occasioned by another word on account of _sanhita_ or juxta-position, as in (VIII. 3. 7).\n\nSee (VIII. 2. 3) (_Vartika_ 2) by which the _lopa_ is considered _siddha_ in हरिवः, otherwise there would have been no उ change in हरिवो मे &c.",
    "83002": "This is an _adhikara_ _sutra_. For the letter which stands before that letter for which रु has been substituted, there is substituted a nasal vowel, in this division of Grammar, where रु is the subject of discussion.\n\nThus _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 5) says \"In the place of the final of सम्, there is रु when सुट् augment follows\". The vowel अ of सम् becomes nasal; as सँस्कर्त्ता, सँस्कर्त्तुम्, सँस्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ Why have we used the word अत्र in the _sutra_? It means \"here i. e. in this division where रु is the subject of discussion\". Objection:- This object would have been gained, without using the word अत्र; since it is an _adhikara_ _sutra_ and would apply to रु ॥ Answer:- No. Here रु is taught in connection with nasal, therefore, the rule would not apply to any other context. For had अत्र not been used, we could not have known the extent of the jurisdiction (_adhikara_) of this nasal; and we might have applied the rule of nasality to those beyond the jurisdiction of रु, such as (VIII. 3. 13). The employment of अत्र prevents this doubt and shows that रु and nasality are co-extensive.",
    "83003": "Thus (VIII. 3. 9) teaches रु substitution of म, the long आ preceding it, would have been optionally nasal by the last _sutra_. The present _sutra_ makes it necessarily so. Thus महाँ असि (_Rig_. III. 46. 2) महाँ इन्द्रो य ओजसा (_Rig_. VIII. 6. I). देवाँ अच्छादीव्यत् ॥\n\nSome (i. e. the _Taittariyas_) read it as _anusvara_. This is a Vedic diversity.\n\nWhy do we say \"for a long आ\"? Observe ये वा वनस्पतीरनु ॥ Why do we say \"when a vowel or ह, य, व, or र follows\"? Observe भवांश्चरति, भवांश्छादयति ॥\n\nThe word नित्य 'always' is employed for the sake of distinctness only. The very fact of making a separate _sutra_, would give it a compulsory force, even without the word _nitya_.",
    "83004": "The substitution of nasal is optional by (VIII. 3. 2). When nasal is not substituted, we add an _anusvara_ to such vowel. The word अन्य should be read into the _sutra_ to complete the sense, i.e. अनुनासिकात् अन्यो यो वर्णः \"a letter other than a nasal\", i. e. a letter for which nasal has not been ordained, and which stands before रु ॥\n\nThus (VIII. 3. 5), teaches substitution of the म् of सम् an _anusvara_ would be added. As संस्कर्त्ता, संस्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ Similarly (VIII. 3. 6), teaches रु substitution of the म् of पुम् ॥ An _anusvara_ will be added here also, as, पुंस्कामा ॥ Similarly (VIII. 3. 7), teaches रु substitution of final म् ॥ Here also an _anusvara_ will be added, as भवांश्चरति ॥\n\nSome say \"the word परः in the _sutra_ means अन्यः, and so we need not supply the word अन्यः from outside\". They say अनुनासिकात् परः = अनुनासिकादन्यः; i. e. the _anusvara_ takes place in that alternative when there is no nasal. That _anusvara_ is an augment and not a substitute. It is an augment to the vowel which precedes रु ॥",
    "83005": "The augment सुट् is added by (VI. 1. 137) &c. Thus सँस्स्कर्त्ता or संस्स्कर्त्ता, सँस्स्कर्तुम् or संस्स्कर्तुम्, सँस्स्कर्त्तव्यम् or संस्स्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The word is thus evolved: सम् + स् + कर्ता = सर् + स् + कर्ता (VIII. 3. 5). Here rule (VIII. 3. 15) appears and requires to be changed to _visarjaniya_. This _visarga_ may optionally be retained unchanged by (VIII. 3. 36). This, however, is not done in the present instance : but the _visarga_ is always and necessarily changed to स् by (VIII. 3. 34). In fact, the option of (VIII. 3. 36) is a determinate option (_vyavasthita_ _vibhasha_) and does not apply to the present case.\n\nOr even this _sutra_ may be so read as to teach the स् substitution as well. Thus, the _sutra_ is समः स्सुटि with two स्, and the _sutra_ will mean, \"रु is substituted for the म् of सम् before सुट्, and this रु is always changed to स्\" ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"for the म् of सम्\"? Observe उपस्कर्त्ता ॥ Why do we say \"before सुट्\"? Observe संकृति ॥\n\nVart:- For the finals of सम्, पुम् and कान् there is always substituted स ॥ There would arise anomalies, if रु be substituted. Thus संस्कर्त्ता, पुंस्स्कामा, कांस्स्कान् ॥ In fact, according to this _vartika_, रु is never substituted for सम् (VIII. 3. 5), पुम् (VIII. 3. 6) and कान् (VIII. 3. 12).\n\nVart:- समो वा लोपमेके ॥ Some would have the elision of the स् after सम् ॥ This _Vartika_ is not given in the _Kasika_, but the _Padamanjari_ gives it, and so also the _Mahabhashya_.\n\nAccording to _Bhattoji_ _Dikshita_ there will be 108 forms of this word संस्कर्त्ता ॥ Thus सँस्कर्त्ता and संस्कर्त्ता with the elision of स् ॥ Then with two स्, as सँस्स्कर्त्ता or संस्स्कर्ता ॥ Then we apply (VIII. 4. 47) to this latter, and have three स, as सँस्स्स्कर्ता or संस्स्स्कर्ता ॥ The _anusvara_ is considered to be a vowel (अच्) for this purpose. From the three nasal forms सँस्कर्ता, सँस्स्कर्ता and सँस्स्स्कर्ता, we get three more by doubling the क् by the _vartika_ : शरः खयः ॥ The three forms having _anusvara_, will also double their _anusvara_ in addition to क् doubling. Thus we have 12 forms in _anusvara_: and six in nasal, altogether 18 forms. Then the त will be doubled and trebled : and thus with one त, two त and three त, we have 3 x 18 = 54 forms. This will be doubled (2 x 54 = 108) when अण् is nasalised.",

It is changed always to स् here by (VIII. 3. 34), also. The स् of पुंस् is dropped by (VIII. 2. 23), and the preceding sound is म, which comes to light in forms like पुमान् &c. For the sake of distinctness, _Panini_ has elected to exhibit the shorter form पुम् when in the beginning of a composition : because this shorter form पुम् is the real stem in composition.  खय् _pratyahara_ includes the ten hard consonants, and अम् _pratyahara_ includes all vowels, semivowels and nasals. पुंस्कामा is formed by the affix ण = पुमांसं कामयते ॥\n\nIn that alternative when we read the preceding _sutra_ as समः स्सुटि, then the _anuvritti_ of this स् will be current in the present sutra_ also, and so there will be no scope for the operation of (VIII. 3. 37). And though the _anuvritti_ of रु is also current, yet it will not apply here, because of its non-appropriateness in that alternative.\n\nWhy do we say 'before a surd mute'? Observe पुंदासः, पुंगवः (V. 4. 92). Why do we say 'followed by a vowel or semivowel or nasal'? Observe पुंक्षीरः, पुंक्षुरः ॥ Why do we use the word परे in the _sutra_? Had we not used it, the _sutra_ might have been open to this construction also. The म् of पुम् is so changed before a खय् letter which has an अम् letter, (whether preceding it or following it).

The form will be श्वलिड् ढौकते ॥ Nor is this ढ लोपः rule an _apavada_ to जश्त्व rule, because it has its scope in लीढ &c. For the जश् rule depends upon one _pada_, and is _antaranga_, or being prior to this the _lopa_ is _asiddha_ with regard to it. Therefore जश्त्व will take place first. Moreover in लिढ् + ढ to there is similarity of sounds (श्रुतिकृतं आनन्तर्यम्); though there may not be theoretical similarity (शास्त्रकृतं आनन्तर्यम्) when the change of ध into ढ by (VIII. 4. 41), is considered _asiddha_. But this theoretical technical dissimilarity will be removed by the express text of the present _sutra_. But in श्वलिड् ढौकते there is neither similarity of sounds (_sruti_ _krtamanantaryam_) between ड् and ढ्, nor similarity created by any technical rule; therefore ढ लोप has no scope here. It is _Bahiranga_ as well as subsequent to जश् rule (VIII. 2. 39), and therefore doubly _asiddha_; and consequently it does not debar the जश् rule. So when ढ् is changed to ड् by जश् rule (VIII. 2. 39) in श्वलिड्, then there remains no sort of _anantarya_-neither of _sruti_ nor of _sastra_.",
    "83014": "The _sutra_ is रः रि, and not रोः रि ॥ That is रो रि is the form which रः रि and रोः रि will both assume. रः is the Genitive of र्, and रोः would be the Genitive of रु ॥ The _sutra_ is not confined to रु only, but to every र् in general including रु ॥ Thus नीरक्तम्, दूरक्तम्, where it is simple र् of निर् and दुर्; and अग्नी रथः, and इन्दू रथः where it is रु (अग्निः रथः, इन्दुः रथः). The lengthening is by (VI. 3. 111). The word पदस्य is understood here, and the Genitive here has the force of विशेषण i. e. a quality, or _avayava_-_shashthi_; i. e. when रेफ is a portion of the _pada_. Thus a रेफ which is not at the end of a _pada_ is also elided. Had the Genitive been construed as _sthana_-_shashthi_, then रेफ would qualify पद, and the rule would mean \"र् should be elided before a र् when at the end of a word.\" See (VIII. 1. 16). But we have the elision of the penultimate र् in अजर्घर्र् the second person singular of the Imperfect of the Intensive, and we get the form अजर्घाः ॥ See (VIII. 2. 37).

Its employment here is superfluous. For letters other than अश् are खर् ॥ Before a खर् letter, the र् will be changed to _visarga_ by (VIII. 3. 15); and the यत्व of this rule will be considered as _asiddha_ for the purposes of (VIII. 3. 15), so there will necessarily be _visarga_.

Had हशि been used in (VIII. 3. 22), then in (VIII. 3. 23), हलि ought to have been used.\n\nMoreover अशि is used in this _sutra_, so that rules (VIII. 3. 18), (VIII. 3. 19) may not apply to वृक्षव् करोति ॥\n\nThis _sutra_ applies to रु called र्, therefore not here प्रातरत्र, पुनरत्र ॥",

The places of pronunciation are palate &c, the organs are the root, the middle and the tip of the tongue.

Therefore, where there is not the lighter articulation of व् and य् by the last _sutra_, there also in the other alternative the fuller sounds of व् and य् are heard. Thus there are three forms, heavy व् and य्, light व् and य् and elision of व् and य् ॥\n\nWhen व् and य् are preceded by ओ, then there is elision by the next _sutra_ compulsorily.",

So that the rule may not apply to उञ् the form assumed by वेञ् by _samprasarana_ as तन्त्रे उतं = तन्त्रयुतम् ॥ Objection:- उञ् could never have meant the form assumed by वेञ्, for the _samprasarana_ of वेञ् is उ, the ञ् is merely indicatory. Moreover the maxim of _lakshana_-_pratipadokta_ &c, will prevent the inclusion of this उञ् resulting from vocalisation, when there is a separate Particle उञ् ॥\n\nAnswer:- The word पदे is used here for the sake of the subsequent _sutras_ like (VIII. 3. 32). So that ङ्मुट् may come before a word beginning with a vowel, and not before a vowel which is an affix. Thus there is no double in न् in परमदण्डिना ॥ This is also a _nitya_ rule, and not optional.

Moreover _Patanjali_ in his commentary on the _Pratyahara_ _sutra_ लण् says that no words can end in ह्, य्, र्, व् or ल् ॥ So that the existence of the very word वृक्षव् is doubtful.\n\nThe word _sarvesham_ indicates that (VIII. 3. 18), even does not apply, and there is no light articulation, but _lopa_ there too.",

I. 46), and not to the beginning of the second word. In _sanhita_ reading, it would have made no difference practically, whether these augments were added to the end of the first, or the beginning of the second. But they are added to the end of the first, in order to indicate that (VIII. 4. 63), will take effect. Thus we have प्राङ्क् छेते also. This छ change of श would not have taken place had the augment क् been added to श् of शेते; because in शश्छोटि (VIII. 4. 63) the झय् letter must be at the end of a _pada_. So that if क् were added to  श of शेते, as क्शेते, here too श follows a झय् letter, but this झय् letter (क्) is not at the end of a _pada_, so श will not be changed to छ (VIII. 4. 63). Thus श is not changed to छ in the body of a word, like विरप्शिन् though प् is a झय् letter. पुरा क्रूरस्य विसृपो विरप्शिन् ॥ विरप्शिन् = महत्, formed with the Preposition वि added to the root रप्, with the _Unadi_ affix शिनि ॥\n\nMoreover in प्राङ्क् साये, the स is not changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 59).

But being at the beginning of the second word, (VIII. 4. 42) would prevent this change. श्वलिट्त् + साये = श्वलिट्ट्साये, (VIII. 4. 41) but the correct form is श्वलिट् त्साये ॥ For the ह of श्वलिह् is ढ substituted by (VIII. 2. 31), which becomes ड् by (VIII. 2. 39), for the ध of the augment, त is substituted by (VIII. 4. 55), and for ड् there is ट् by the same rule.",

This view of the _Kasika_, however, is not approved by _Padamanjari_. The न् can never be changed to रु here, because त् is followed by स् which is not an अम् letter.

The _sutra_ स्तोः श्चुना श्चुः (VIII. 4. 40) should be divided into two parts, in order to prevent ण change. Thus the first part will be स्तोः श्चुना, which will mean that स and तु followed by श and चु will not cause the change of न to ण ॥ The next _sutra_ will be श्चुः, which will mean that the preceding  स and तु are changed to श and चु respectively.",
    "83032": "The word ङमः is in the Ablative singular here; and ह्रस्वात् qualifies ङमः and ङम् itself qualifies the word पदस्य understood, and thus there is _tadanta_-_viddhi_. Though the word पदस्य (VIII. 1. 16) is in the Genitive singular, yet it should be converted here into Ablative singular, because of its connection with ङमः ॥ अचि is in the Locative singular, but should be construed as Genitive singular here : it is exhibited in the 7th case for the sake of brevity, and of the subsequent _sutras_. ङम् is a _pratyahara_ meaning ङ, ण and न; and so also ङमुट् is a _pratyahara_ containing the three augments ङुट्, णुट् and नुट् ॥\n\nIn other words ङ् is augment after ङ्, ण् after ण् and न् after म्; or that these letters are doubled practically. Thus ङुट् is the augment after a word ending in ङ्, as प्रत्यङ्ङास्ते ॥ णुट् is the augment after a word ending in ण्, as वणणास्ते ॥ नुट् is the augment after a word ending in न्, as कुर्वन्नास्ते, कुर्वन्नवोचत्, कृषन्नास्ते, कृषन्नवोचत् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'ending in ङ, ण or न'? See त्वमास्ते ॥ Why do we say 'preceded by a light vowel'? Observe प्राङास्ते, भवानास्ते ॥ Why do we say \"followed by a vowel\"? Observe प्रत्यङ्करोति ॥\n\nThe _Mahabhashya_ thus comments on this aphorism :-\n\nVart:- ङमुटि पदादिग्रहणम् \"The ङमुट् augment is added to a vowel which stands at the beginning of a word\". So that in दण्डिन् + आ (Instrumental Singular), नुट् is not added to आ, because it is not the beginning of a _Pada_. Then should this _vartika_ be held to be necessary? No, because the word पदात् is understood here: so नुट् will not come in दण्डिना ॥ But then it will come in परमदण्डिन् + आ ॥ Because it is a compound of two nouns, and though the case-affixes have been elided, yet दण्डिन् is here a _Pada_ by reason of _pratyaya_ _lakshana_; and hence there should be नुट् here added to आ ॥ Answer:- This is no valid objection. दण्डिन् is not here a _Pada_, on the maxim उत्तरपदत्वे चापदादिविधौलुमता लुप्ते प्रत्ययलक्षणं न भवति \"When an affix has been elided by लुक् or लुप्, the _pratyaya_-_lakshana_ rule will not apply, when the object of it is to give the designation of _Pada_ to the second member of a compound, with the exception of the rule applying to the beginning of a _Pada_\". Thus in परमदण्डिन् the word दण्डिन् is not treated as a पद, because the rule to be applied is to the end here. But the second member of a compound is treated like a _pada_, when a rule is to be applied to the beginning of a _Pada_. Thus in दधिसेचौ, the second member सेच् is considered as a _Pada_ for the purposes of the rule सात् पदाद्योः (VIII. 3. 111), and the स is not changed to ष ॥ This view proceeds upon the supposition that the word पदात् governs this _sutra_. But the _anuvritti_ of पदात् ceased with (VIII. I. 27), as we stated before. How are we then to get out of this difficulty? Are we to make the above _vartika_ necessary? No: because the _anuvritti_ of पदे from (VIII. 3. 21) runs into this _sutra_. So that the _sutra_ means अजादौ पदे ङमुड् भवति ॥ \"The augment ङमुट् is added to a vowel with which a _Pada_ commences\".

This is possible only before the affixes पाश, कल्प, क, and काम्य ॥ Thus पयस्पाशम् (V. 3. 47); पयस्कल्पम्, यशस्कल्पम्, (V. 3. 67), पयस्कं, यशस्कम्, (V. 3. 70); पयस्काम्यति, यशस्काम्यति (III. I. 9).\n\nWhy do we say 'when not at the beginning of a word'? Observe पयᳶ कामयते, पयᳶ पिबति ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated, when the _visarga_ belongs to an Indeclinable: as, प्रातः कल्पम्, पुनः कल्पम् ॥\n\nVart:- The _visarga_ which comes from रु is only changed to स before काम्य, and not any other _visarga_. As पयस्काम्यात, and यशस्काम्यति; but not here, गीः काम्यति धूः काम्यति ॥\n\nVart:- स is the substitute of the _Upadhmaniya_ when followed by a guttural. The root उᳶज् (आजवे _Tudadi_ 20) has _Upadhmaniya_ as its penultimate: though it is written in the _Dhatupatha_ as उव्ज the व् only represents the प् of ᳶप, and is not to be pronounced. This ᳶप is changed to स, when the final ज् is changed to a guttural, as उ स ग, and then this स् is changed to द्, as in अभ्युद्गः, समुद्गः ॥\n\nThese words, however, may be derived from the root गम with the Prepositions अभि, उत्, and सम् उत्, by adding the affix उ ॥",
    "83039": "The word अपदादौ is understood here also. The affixes meant are the same पाश, कल्प, क, and काम्य ॥ Thus सर्पिष्पाशम्, यजुष्पाशम्, सर्पिष्कल्पम्, यजुष्कल्पम्, सर्पिष्कम्, यजुष्कम्; सर्पिष्काम्यति, यजुष्काम्यति ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'by an affix'? Observe अग्निः करोति, वायुः करोति, अग्निः पचति, वायुः पचति ॥\n\nThe affix should begin with a guttural or a labial. Therefore not here, सर्पिस्ते, यजुस्ते ॥\n\nIn the succeeding _sutras_, the _anuvritti_ of स from (VIII. 3. 39) and of इणः षः from this, are both current. The _visarga_ will be changed to ष if preceded by इ or उ, otherwise it will be स ॥\n\nAccording to some, this _sutra_ ordains ष् in the room of the स् taught in the preceding _sutra_, and not of _visarga_ : and so also in the following _sutras_.",
    "83040": "Thus नमस्कर्त्ता, नमस्कर्तुम्, नमस्कर्त्तव्यम्; पुरस्कर्त्ता पुरस्कर्तुम्, पुरस्कर्त्तव्यम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when they are _Gati_\"? Observe पूःकरोति, पुरौ करोति, पुरः करोति ॥ Here पुरः is a noun, Accusative Plural of पूः ॥\n\nनमस् is _Gati_ by (I. 4. 74), and पुरस् is _Gati_ by (I. 4. 67). The _anuvritti_ of अपदादौ ceases.",
    "83041": "This applies to the _visarga_ of निर्, दुर्, बहिर्, अविस्, चतुर् and प्रादुस् ॥ Thus निष्कृतम्, निष्पीतम्, दुष्कृतम्, दुष्पीतम्, बहिस्, बहिष्कृतम्, बहिष्पीतम्, आविस्, आविष्कृतम्, आविष्पीतम्, चतुष्कृतम्, चतुष्कपालम्, चतुष्कन्दलम्, चतुष्कलम्, प्रादुष्कृतम्, प्रादुष्पीतम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when not belonging to an affix'? Observe अग्निः करोति, वायुः करोति ॥ How do you explain मातुः करोति, पितुः करोति? For here in पितुः &c, the स् of the affix is elided by (VIII. 2. 24), and the र् of पितुर् + स् is changed to _visarga_; this is not the _visarga_ of an affix, and ought to be changed to ष् ॥\n\nAnswer:- The inclusion of the word भ्रातुष्पुत्रः in _Kaskadi_ class (VIII. 3. 48) indicates by implication, that ष change does not take place of this _visarga_ in पितुः, मातुः &c: the only exception being भ्रातुः ॥ The reason of this may be that the _visarga_ here does not follow a simple उ, but an _ekadesa_ उ (VI. I. 111).\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated in the case of पुम् and मुहुस्; as पुंस्कामा, मुहुस्कामा ॥\n\nVart:- वृद्धिभूतानां षत्वं वक्तव्यम् । The _visarga_ is changed to ष even when इ or उ are _vriddhied_; as नैष्कुल्यम्, दौष्कुल्यम् ॥\n\nVart:- प्लुतानां तादौ च ॥ The _visarga_ is changed to ष even when इ or उ are _pluta_, and then before dentals as well as gutturals and labials. Thus नि३ष्कुलम्, दु३ष्कुलम् (VIII. 2. 86) for _pluta_)). दु३ष्पुरुषः, वही३ष्टरः ॥\n\nThese last two _vartikas_ may be dispensed with, because _Vriddhi_ and _Pluta_ are _Bahiranga_ change, and so the _visarga_ will be changed to ष in these cases also by the _sutra_ itself; except so far as त is concerned.",
    "83042": "Thus तिरस्कर्त्ता, तिरस्कर्त्तुम्, तिरस्कर्त्तव्यम्, or तिरः कर्त्ता, तिरः कर्त्तुम्, तिरः कर्त्तव्यम् ॥ The word गतेः is understood here also. Therefore no option is allowed here, तिरः कृत्वा काण्डं गतः, where तिरस् does not mean 'disappearance'. (I. 4. 72).",
    "83043": "The affix सुच् (स्) is added to the three words _dvi_, _tri_ and _chatur_ in the sense of _krtvasuch_ by (V. 4. 18).\n\nAs द्विः करोति or द्विष्करोति, त्रिः करोति or त्रिष्करोति, चतुः करोति or चतुष्करोति, द्विः पचति or द्विष्पचति, त्रिः पचति or त्रिष्पचति, चतुः पचति or चतुष्पचति ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when used in the sense of _kritvasuch_ or Numeral adverbs '? Observe चतुष्कपालम्, चतुष्कण्टकम्, where ष is compulsory by (VIII. 3. 41). चतुर्षु कपालेषु संस्कृतः (IV. 2. 16) and (IV. 1. 88). This _sutra_ is an example of _ubhayatra_-_vibhasha_. With regard to चतुर् the _visarga_ is a non-affix _visarga_, and hence (VIII. 3. 41), would have made ष compulsory, this makes it optional. With regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् the _visarga_ is that of an affix (सुच् or स् (V. 4. 18)), and hence (VIII. 3. 41), would not have applied. Thus with regard to चतुर् it is a _Prapta_-_vibhasha_, and with regard to द्विस् and त्रिस् it is an _Aprapta_ _vibhasha_. \n\nWhy have we used the words '_dvis_, _tris_ and _chatur_'? Objector's answer: so that the rule may not apply to पंचकृत्वः करोति, the _visarga_ of _kritvasuch_ (V. 4. 17) is not changed to ष् ॥\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of उ and इ is understood here from (VIII. 3. 41): so that the _visarga_ must be preceded by इ and उ for the application of this rule. In पञ्चकृत्वः the _visarga_ is preceded by अ, and so there is no applicability of this rule.\n\nIn fact, by reading the _anuvritti_ of इदुदुपधा into this _sutra_, and qualifying the _visarga_ by the further epithet of 'belonging to a word that has the sense of _kritvasuch_'; we may dispense with the words द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरिति from the _sutra_. The simple _sutra_ कृत्वोर्थे would have been enough. For there are no other Numerals that have a penultimate इ or उ, except these three. The chief objection to this view is, that in चतुर् the _visarga_ is not the affix सुच्, but a portion of the word (See (V. 4. 18)): so the rule would not apply to _chatur_, if this word were not expressly mentioned.\n\nThe various objections and their solutions are given in the following verses.\n\nकृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्माच्चचतुष्कपाले मा\nषत्वं विभाषया भूम्ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥\nसिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे ॥\nलुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥\nएवं सति त्विदानीं द्वित्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥\nअन्यो हि नेदुदुपधः कृत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति ॥\nअक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत ॥\nचतुरो न सिध्यति तथा रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि ॥\nतस्मिंस्तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति ॥\nप्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि विशेषणं न्याय्यम् ॥\n\n_Karika_:- कृत्वसुजर्थे षत्वं ब्रवीति कस्मात्? Why does the author teach षत्व when these words have the sense of Numeral-adverbs? In other words, why the word कृत्वोर्थे is used at all in the _sutra_? There is no necessity of using it at all, because द्विस्, त्रिस् are clearly adverbs as they are formed by the affix सुच् (V. 4. 18) and चतुर् being read in their company will also denote the adverb _chatur_, in which सुच् has been elided (V. 4. 18). So that all these three words are सुच्-formed, and all सुच्-formed words have the sense of _Krtvasuch_. One answer to this is that the rule of साहचर्य does not always hold good, as in दीधीवेवीटाम् (I. 1. 6), the words दीधी and वेवी are verbs, while इट् is an augment. Though therefore द्विस् and त्रिस् are _krtvortha_ words, yet चतुर् need not be so: and may be a simple Numeral. Answer: चतुष्कपाले मा षत्वं विभाषया भूत् ॥ The word कृत्वोर्थे is employed to indicate that there should be no optional षत्व in चतुष्कपालं ॥ The षत्व here is compulsory by (VIII. 3. 41). Question: ननु सिद्धं तत्र पूर्वेण ॥ Well this would be valid by the previous _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 41). That is, let in चतुष्कपाल also there be optional षत्व, as चतुःकपाल and चतुष्कपाल ॥ Now rule (VIII. 3. 41) will apply to चतुःकपाल and will change this _visarga_ to ष, so that with regard to चतुष्कपाल, we shall have always ष ॥ Answer:- सिद्धे ह्ययं विधत्ते चतुरः षत्वं यदापि कृत्वोर्थे, लुप्ते कृत्वोर्थीये रेफस्य विसर्जनीयो हि । If (VIII. 3. 41) be considered as applying here (_siddha_), then when the affix सुच् is elided after चतुर्, and the र is changed to _visarga_, then the adverb चतुः also ends with a non-affix _visarga_, and will come under the compulsory षत्व rule of (VIII. 3. 41); for though we may have optionally two forms as चतुः करोति and चतुष्करोति, by the present _sutra_, yet in the former the _visarga_ would be changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 41). Hence the necessity of employing the word कृत्वोर्थे ॥ Question: But we say that the र् in the adverb चतुर् is that of सुच्, thus चतुर् + स् = चतुर् + र् (VIII. 2. 66) = चतु + र् (the first र् is elided by (VIII. 3. 14)) = चतुर्; and that this र् when changed to _visarga_, will be an affix-_visarga_ and so (VIII. 3. 41) will not apply to the adverb चतुर् ॥ Answer:- No. For उ would require to be lengthened by (VI. 3. 111). and the form would be चतूर् ॥\n\nएवं सति त्विदानीं द्विस्त्रिश्चतुरित्यनेन किं कार्यम् ॥ If this be so, then what is the purpose served by using the words द्विस् त्रिश्चतुरिति in the aphorism? The simple _sutra_ कृत्वोऽर्थे would have been enough. Because (अन्योहि नेदुदुपधः कुत्वोर्थः कश्चिदप्यस्ति) there are no other numeral adverbs than these three which have a penultimate इ or उ ॥\n\nअक्रियमाणे ग्रहणे विसर्जनीयस्तदा विशेष्येत । If we do not use the words _dvis_, _tris_, _chaturiti_ in the _sutra_, then the word_ krtvorthe_ would qualify the word _visarga_, and the _sutra_ would mean \" the _visarga_ of an affix which has the sense of _kritvasuch_ is changed optionally to ष\" ॥ The result of this will be that (चतुरा न सिध्यति तथारेफस्य विसर्जनीयोहि) it will not apply to चतुः where the _visarga_ is that of र् and not of the affix सुच् ॥\n\nTherefore by using _dvis_ &c, the word कृत्वोर्थे would qualify चतुर् (तस्मिन् तु क्रियमाणे युक्तं चतुरो विशेषणं भवति) ॥\n\nAnswer:- प्रकृतं पदं तदन्तं तस्यापि, विशेषणं नाय्यम् ॥ Though we may not use _dvis_ &c, the word _krtvortha_ will not qualify _visarga_, but will qualify the word पद whose context runs here; and the rule of तदन्त will apply; so that the _sutra_ कृत्वोऽर्थे will mean, पदस्य कृत्वोर्थे वर्त्तमानस्य यो विसर्जनीयः, तस्य सकारः षकारो व ॥ \"The _visarga_ of that word which is employed in the sense of a Numeral adverb, is optionally changed to स् or ष् before a guttural or a labial, provided that such _visarga_ is preceded by इ or उ\".\n\nThe above is the opinion of _Patanjali_, who considers the words _dvis_ &c, as redundant. The _Kasika_ however controverts this opinion. According to him, if these words were not used in the _sutra_, then the mere _sutra_ कृत्वोऽर्थे would be insufficient for the _visarga_ of चतुः though used as an adverb, the षत्व will be compulsory by (VIII. 3. 41); for the present _sutra_ will be considered as _asiddha_ or non-existent for the purposes of (VIII. 3. 41), (See (VIII. 2. 1)). But this however may be answered by saying that the rule of पूर्वत्रासिद्धम् applies in these chapters, with this modification, one subject-matter is considered as _asiddha_ with regard to another subject-matter gone before; but one aphorism is not considered _asiddha_ with regard to a previous aphorism, when belonging to the same subject matter. (प्रकरणे प्रकरणमसिद्धं न योगे योगः) ॥ Therefore the present _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 43), would not be considered _asiddha_ with regard to (VIII. 3. 41). Or the present _sutra_ may be considered as an _apavada_ to (VIII. 3. 41): and an _apavada_ is never _asiddha_ with regard to an _utsarga_.",
    "83044": "The ष is understood here. Thus सर्पिष्करोति or सर्पिः करोति, यजुः करोति or यजुष्करोति ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'when the two words are correlated'? Observe तिष्ठतु सर्पिः, पिब त्वमुदकम्, where सर्पिः is not in construction with पिब, but with तिष्ठतु ॥\n\nThe word सामर्थ्ये here means व्यपेक्षा or mutual relation of two words; and not \"having the same meaning\", or it may mean both. In fact सामर्थ्य is equivalent to आकाङ्क्षा i.e. the syntactical want of another word to complete the sense. It does not here mean 'compound'. For it being a पदविधिः the word समर्थः is understood here (समर्थः पदविधिः (II. I. 1)). The employment of the word सामर्थ्य here indicates that it is a different _samarthya_ from that of (II. 1. 1). It does not denote एकार्थीभावः or ऐकार्थ्य which is the _samarthya_ of compounds where two or more words denote one object. The _samarthya_ here means _vyapeksha_, which is thus defined नानाभूतयोः, पदार्थयो र्यौ शब्दौ, तयो र्यो योगः \"the syntactical union of two words expressing two different ideas\".",

Observe परमसर्पिः कुण्डिका, परमधनुः कपालम् ॥ The option even of the last sutra does not apply to these examples.\n\nQuestion: The word सर्पिस् is derived from the root सृप् by adding the _Unadi_ affix इसि (_Unadi_ II. 109), and यजुस् by the Unadi affix उसि (_Unadi_ II. 117), therefore on the maxim प्रत्ययग्रहणे &c, the word इसुसोः would denote the mere forms सर्पिस् and यजुस् and not forms like परमसर्पिस् &c. then what is the necessity of employing the word अनुत्तरपदस्थस्य in the _sutra_?\n\nThe very employment of the word _anuttara_-_pada_-_sthasya_ in this _sutra_, is an indicator (_jnapaka_), that the restriction of the following maxim does not apply with regard to the affixes इस् and उस् : प्रत्ययग्रहणे यस्मात् स विहित स्तदादेस्तदन्तस्य ग्रहणम् \"an affix denotes, whenever it is employed in Grammar, a word-form which begins with that to which that affix has been added and ends with the affix itself\". This maxim not applying, we have परमसर्पिष्करोति or परमसर्पिः करोति by the previous _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 44).\n\nQuestion: Why is not there option in the case of compounds also by the previous _sutra_?\n\nAnswer:- Because the word सामर्थ्य there means व्यपेक्षा, and therefore does not apply to compounds.",

As तिष्ठतु सर्पिष्कुण्डिकां आनय ॥ So also when there is correlation, as इदं सर्पिष्कुण्डिकायाः ॥ Here सर्पिस् is an incomplete word. The ष change, will take place even where there is no compounding. Where there is no compounding, and there is complete want of correlation, even there the ष will invariably come. And where there is correlation, but no compounding there the ष would have been optional by (VIII. 3. 44), but it becomes invariable here, on account of these words being so listed. Thus we have these cases : (1) Without correlation, as तिष्ठतु सर्पिष्कुण्डिकामानय ॥ (2) Where there is correlation, as इदं  सर्पिष्कुण्डिकायाः ॥ (3) Where there is composition, as सर्पिष्कुण्डिका ॥ (4) Where there is no composition and no correlation even, as, in example (1).

There is another form साड् not derived from सह् ॥ Thus सह डेन वर्त्तते = सडः, सडस्य अपत्यं = साडिः ॥ He in whose name there is the letter ड is called सड; as मृड ॥\n\nWhy do we say 'in the form of साड्'? The rule will not apply when the form is साह, as जलासाहम्, तुरासाहम् ॥ Why do we say सः \"for the स\"? So that the आ of साड् may not be changed to cerebral : the ड् is already cerebral.",

    "83058": "The word व्यवाय 'separation, intervention' applies to every one of the words नुम्, &c. Thus (1) when नुम् intervenes, as सर्पींषि, यजूंषि, हवींषि (VII. 1. 72), (VI. 4. 10). (2) When a _visarjaniya_ intervenes, as सर्पिःषु, यजुःषु, हविःषु  (VIII. 3. 36) (3) When a Sibilant intervenes, as सर्पिष्षु, यजुष्षु हविष्षु ॥ \n\nThe षत्व takes place, when नुम् &c intervene singly and not when they intervene collectively. Therefore not here, निंस्से, निंस्स्वे from the root निंस् 'to kiss'. Here there is the intervention of two, namely, नुम् and स् (III. 4. 91).\n\nThe word इण्कोः is in the Ablative case, and it required that the स् should follow immediately after it. Hence the necessity of the present _sutra_ for the intervention of certain letters.",
    "83059": "The word cerebral is understood here from (VIII. 3. 55), as well as स ॥ The _sutra_ _adesa_-_pratyayoh_ is in the Genitive case. The force of the Genitive however is different in the word _adesa_, from what it is in _pratyaya_. In the first it is _samanadhikarana_-_shashthi_, in the latter _avayava_-yogashashthi_. That is that स् which is an _adesa_, and that स् which belongs to an affix. If we took it as _avayavayoga_ _shashthi_ in both places, then the _sutra_ would mean \"of that स् which is a portion of a substitute, or of an affix,\" and there would arise the following anomaly. In doubling a word by (VIII. 1. 1), one view is that two are substituted in the room of one (See (VIII. 1. 1)). Thus बिसंबिसं, मुसलंमुसलं ॥ Here the स् in these words, is a portion of a substitute, and would be changed to ष्, if we translate the _sutra_ as above.\n\nIf we take the other view, and translate the _sutra_ as \"of that स् which is a substitute or an affix\", we land on the following anomaly. We must have forms like करिस्यति and हरिस्यति, and not the correct forms करिष्यति, हरिष्यति; for here स is not an affix, but a portion of an affix. In fact, with regard to affixes, the _sutra_ would be confined to those affixes only which consist of a single स्, such as सिप् in the Vedic subjunctive लेट् ॥ That this is the proper interpretation of the _sutra_ is indicated by the _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 60), (the next aphorism). The substitute घस् is taken in this _sutra_. If therefore, the force of Genitive in आदेशस्य was = आदेशस्य यः सकारः and not = आदेशः यः सकारः, then there would have been no necessity of including the substitute घस् in the _sutra_, for then the present _sutra_ would have covered the case of घस् also. Similarly, if the force of the Genitive in प्रत्ययस्य was = प्रत्ययः यः सकारः, and not = प्रत्ययस्यः यः सकारः; then there would have been no necessity of excluding the affix सात् (V. 4. 52) from the operation of the present rule by (VIII. 3. 111), because it is not an affix consisting of a single letter स् ॥\n\nHaving surmised this, we shall now give illustrations. First of that स् which is a substitute. It can only be the स् which replaces the ष् of a root in _Dhatupatha_. Thus सिषेव, सुष्वाप ॥ Of an affix, we have अग्निषु, वायुषु, कर्तृषु, हर्तृषु; वक्षत् in इन्द्रो मा वक्षत्; and यक्षत् in स देवान् यक्षत् ॥\n\nIn the case of वक्षत् and यक्षत्, the स् is not the portion of an affix, but the whole affix itself: the present _sutra_ should therefore not apply to this स् ॥\n\nAnswer:- Here we apply the maxim व्यपदेशिवद् एकस्मिन् ॥\n\nThese words (वक्षत् and यक्षत्) are from the roots वच् and यज्, in लेट् with तिप्, the इ is elided by (III. 4. 97), the augment अट् (III. 4. 94), the affix सिप् by (III. 1. 34); the च् of वच् is changed to a guttural, and the ज् of यज् to ष् and then to a guttural.\n\nThe _Unadi_ word अक्षरं (अश् + सर् _Unadi_ III. 70) complies with this rule, but not so the word कूसरं and धूसरं (_Unadi_ III. 73) formed with the same affix सर ॥",
    "83060": "Thus अन्वशिषत्, अन्वशिषताम्, अन्वशिषन्, the Aorist of शास्; the च्लि is replaced by अङ् (III. 1. 56), and the आ changed to इ by (VI. 4. 34). So also शिष्टः, शिष्टवान् ॥ From वस् we have उषितः, उषितवान्, उषित्वा ॥ The _Samprasarana_ takes place by (VI. I. 15) as it belongs to _yajadi_ class. From घस् we have जक्षतुः, जक्षुः in the Perfect. घस् is the substitute of अद् (II. 4. 40), the penultimate अ is elided by (VI. 4. 98). So also अक्षन् in अक्षन्नमीमदन्त पितरः (_Rig_. I. 82. 2). This is the Aorist form of अद्, the घस् is substituted for अद् (II. 4. 37) the Aorist sign is elided by (II. 4. 80).\n\nThis _sutra_ is made to cover cases not governed by the last _sutra_, namely, where the स् is not an _adesa_. Though the स् in घस् is the स् of a substitute, yet it is not governed by the preceding aphorism, because the word आदेशस्य there means 'the स् which is a substitute'. Here स् is not a substitute, but a portion of a substitute. The non-substitute घस् is not to be taken here : as it seldom occurs.\n\nThe word इण्कोः is understood here also. Therefore the rule would not apply to शास्ति, वसति and जघास ॥",
    "83061": "This rule is confined to the Desideratives of स्तु and of स् beginning roots in the Causative, provided that the Desiderative sign स् is changed to ष् ॥ The rule applies to the स् of the substitute, and not to the affix स् as there can be no such स् after a reduplicate syllable. Therefore स् means that स which replaces the ष् of the roots.\n\nThus from स्तु we have तुष्टूषति ॥ Here the स of सन् is changed to ष by the last _sutra_, and therefore so also after the reduplicate उ, the स of स्तु is changed to put ष ॥\n\nOf the Causatives of roots beginning with ष् in _Dhatupatha_, we have सिषेवयिषति, सिषिञ्जयिषति, सुष्वापयिषति ॥ In this last, the व् is changed to उ by (VII. 4. 67).\n\nThough this ष change would have taken place by the previous _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 59), yet the separate enunciation of this rule indicates that this is a _niyama_ aphorism - the ष change takes place only in these cases of स्तु and Causatives of Desideratives under the conditions mentioned in this _sutra_, and no where else. Thus सिसिक्षति from the root षिच क्षरणे (_Tudadi_ 140). This is a root, which is exhibited in the _Dhatupatha_ with a ष, therefore the form ought to have been सिषिक्षति by (VIII. 3. 59), but it is not so, because of the _niyama_ of the present _sutra_. So also सुसूषते from षूङ् प्राणिप्रसवे (_Divadi_ 24): and सुसूषति from षू प्रेरणे (_Tudadi_ 115).\n\nIf this is a _niyama_ rule by the very fact of its separate enunciation, what is then the necessity of using the word एव in the aphorism ? Answer:- इष्टतोऽवधारणार्थम्; so that, the _sutra_ may mean \"if स्तु and Causatives only, when षण् follows\" ? and not \"if स्तु and Causatives when षण् only follows\". In the latter view, we could not get the form तुष्टाव; and the rule would have applied to सिसिक्षति also.\n\nWhy do we say \"in the Desiderative ष\"? So that the _niyama_ may not be any where else. Had षणि not been used in the _sutra_, the restriction would have been with regard to every affix, and the _sutra_ would have meant \"if there is occasion of षत्व change after a reduplicate, it should take place only in the case of स्तु and the Causatives\". Therefore ष change would not have taken place in सिषेव, as it is not a Causative.\n\nQuestion:- को विनतेऽनुरिधः ? Why have we used the word षण् with ष्, and not the word सन्? That is, what compulsion was there to exhibit the Desiderative affix सन्, in this changed form? The word विनत is the name given in the _Pratisakhyas_ to ष and ण change.\n\nAnswer:- So that the restrictive rule may not apply to the अविनत form of सन् ॥ As सुषुप्सति ॥ The सन् is here कित् by (I. 2. 8), and there is vocalisation by (VI. 1. 15). For had सनि been used in the _sutra_, then the restriction would have been with regard to all Desideratives in general, whether the सन् was changed to ष or not. Therefore as there is restriction of (VIII. 3. 59), in the case of सिसिक्षति where स is not changed to ष; so there would have been restriction in सुषुप्सते, the स् could not have been changed to ष् by (VIII. 3. 59). Similarly in तिष्ठासति ॥\n\nQuestion:- What is the necessity of exhibiting षण् with the _anubandha_ म्? So that the rule should not apply to ष in general, but to the Desiderative affix ष only. As सुषुपिष इन्द्रम् ॥ This सुषुपिषे is the Perfect of स्वप्, the affix थास् is added as _Chhandas_ irregularity instead of थल्; for थास् there is से, the affix is कित् by (I. 2. 5), and so there is vocalisation by (VI. 1. 15), and reduplication, and the augment इट् is added by (VII. 2. 13), the ए is changed to अय्, as सुषुपिषय् इन्द्रं, the य् is elided by (VIII. 3. 19). Here after the reduplicate सु, the स् is changed to ष, in षु by the general rule (VIII. 3. 59), as the restriction of this _sutra_ does not apply in this case. But had ष in general been taken, then सुषुपिष has an affix ष, and\ntherefore _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 59), would have been restricted, and there would have been no change of सु to षु after the reduplicate, as it is not a causative. Hence षण् has been employed with an _anubandha_.\n\nWhy do we say 'after a reduplicate'?\n\nAnswer:- So that this restriction may apply to that ष which would have been caused by the इ or उ of an _abhyasa_, and not to that which would have been caused by an _upasarga_. As अभिषिषिक्षति, though without the Preposition, the form is सिरिक्षति ॥\n\nQuestion:- No, this cannot be the reason, because the ष caused by the _upasarga_ is considered as _asiddha_, and hence there would be no restriction.\n\nAnswer:- Then we say, the _abhyasa_ is taken to be qualified by सन्, namely that _abhyasa_ which is caused by सन्, would give occasion to this rule and not any other _abhyasa_. Therefore if a reduplication has been caused by यङ्, and then षण् is added to it, then the restriction of the present _sutra_ will not apply, and षत्व change will take place though the root may not be a Causative &c. Thus the यङ् of स्वप् is सोषुप्य (VI. 1. 19), the Desiderative of this root is सोषुपिषते, with इट् augment, the elision of अ (VI. 4. 48) of य, the elision of य् by (VI. 4. 49).\n\nQuestion:- No this also cannot be the reason : because the षत्व change is _antaranga_, while the restriction _niyama_ is _Bahiranga_. Therefore, the word _abhyasa_ is employed superfluously in the _sutra_.\n\nAnswer:- The word _abhyasa_ is taken in the _sutra_, so that the restriction may be with regard to that ष which might have been caused by the इ or उ of the _abhyasa_; and not to that ष which might be occasioned by the इ or उ of a _dhatu_ or verbal root. Thus प्रतिषिषति, अधीषिषति ॥ Here the root इ in the sense of बोधन, is turned to Desiderative with सन्; and by (VI. 1. 2), the स is reduplicated, then by (VII. 4. 79), the अ is changed to इ ॥ Thus इसिस; here by the force of the इ of the _abhyasa_ सि, the स is changed to ष as इसिष; (VIII. 3. 59) then as the restriction of this _sutra_ does not apply, the root इ causes the षत्व of the _abhyasa_, as इषिष ॥ Had the word अभ्यासात् not been used in the _sutra_, the स of _abhyasa_ could not have been changed to ष, for then the _sutra_ would have meant \"ष is substituted for स, only in the case of स्तु and Causatives in the Desiderative षण्\"; and as इसिष is not a Causative-Desiderative, the restriction would have applied.",
    "83062": "The स substitute of स् debars the cerebral change. In other words, the स of these roots remains unchanged. As सिस्वेदयिषति, सिस्वादयिषति and सिसाहयिषति ॥",
    "83063": "The root सित् occurs in _sutra_ (VIII. 3. 70). Thus (VIII. 3. 65) teaches ष change: as अभिषुणोति, परिषुणोति, विषुणोति, निषुणोति ॥ So also when अट् intervenes; as अभ्यषुणोत्, पर्यषुणोत्, व्यषुणोत्, न्यषुणोत् ॥ The force of अपि is that the change takes place even when the augment अट् does not come, i. e. in cases other than the augment.",
    "83064": "The words प्राक् सितात् are understood here also. The स्यादि roots are, स्था, सेनय &c in (VIII. 3. 65) and ending with सेव् in (VIII. 3. 70). The _sutra_ consists of two sentences : (1) The षत्व takes place in स्था &c. even when a reduplicate intervenes; (2) The स of the reduplicates of स्था &c. is changed to ष ॥ The first is a _vidhi_ rule, and the second is a _niyama_ rule.\n\nThus परितष्ठौ where the _abhyasa_ त intervenes. This applies even to roots other than those which have been taught with a ष in the _Dhatupatha_. As अभिषिषेणयिषति, परिषिषेणयिषति (सेनया अभियातुमिच्छन्ति). This applies moreover to reduplicates which end in अ, as अभितष्ठौ; here the स् would not have been changed to ष (by (VIII. 3. 59)) as it is not preceded by इ or उ ॥ Another raison d'etre of this _sutra_ is that it prohibits षण् (VIII. 3. 61). As अभिषिषिक्षति, परिषिषिक्षति ॥\n\nThe word अभ्यासस्य is for the sake of _niyama_, as we have said above. स of स्था &c. and of no other roots is changed to ष ॥ As अभिसुसूषति from षू प्रेरणे with सन्, the augment is debarred by (VII. 2. 12): the root स् is unchanged by the _niyama_ prohibition of (VIII. 3. 61); the reduplicate स् remains unchanged by the restriction of the present _sutra_.",
    "83065": "Thus अभिषुणोति, परिषुणोति, अभ्यषुणोत्, पर्यषुणोत् ॥ सुवति, अभिषुवति, परिषुवति, अभ्यषुवत्, पर्यषुवत् ॥ स्यति, अभिष्यति, परिष्यति, अभ्यष्यत् । पर्यष्यत् ॥ स्तौति, अभिष्टौति, परिष्टौति, अभ्यष्टौत् ॥ स्तोभति, अभिष्टोभते, परिष्टोभते, अभ्यष्टोभत, पर्यष्टोभत ॥ स्था, अभिष्ठास्यति, परिष्ठास्यति, अभ्यष्ठात्, पर्यष्ठात्, अभितष्ठौ, परितष्ठौ ॥ सेनय, अभिषेणयति, परिषेणयति, अभ्यषेणयत्, पर्यषेणयत् ॥ अभिषिषेणयिषति, परिषिषेणयिषति ॥ सेध, अभिषेधति, परिषेधति, अभ्यषेधत्, पर्यषेधत् ॥ सिच, अभिषिञ्चति, परिषिञ्चति, अभ्यषिञ्चत्, पर्यषिञ्चत्, अभिषिषिक्षति, परिषिषिक्षति ॥ सञ्ज, अभिषजति, परिषजति, अभ्यषजत्, पर्यषजत्, अभिषिषङ्क्षति, परिषिषङ्क्षति ॥ ष्वञ्ज, अभिष्वजते, परिष्वजते, अभ्यष्वजत, पर्यष्वजत, अभिषिष्वङ्क्षते, परिषिष्वङ्क्षते ॥ सेध इति शब्विकरणनिर्द्देशः सिध्यति निवृत्त्यर्थः ॥ उपसर्गादिति, किम्? दधि सिञ्चति, मधु सिञ्चति, निगताः ॥ सेचका अस्माद्देशान्निः सेचको देश इति ॥ नायं सिचेरुपसर्गः ॥ अभिसावकीयतीत्यत्रापि न सुनोतिं प्रति क्रियायोगः किं तर्हि सावकीयं प्रति ॥ अभिषावयतीत्यत्र तु सुनोतिमेव प्रति क्रियायोगो न सावयतिमिति षत्वं भवति ॥\n\nThe root सिध् is exhibited in the _sutra_ as सेध with शप् _vikarana_, thus debarring सिध् – सिध्यति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"after an _upasarga_\"? Observe दधि सिञ्चति, मधु सिञ्चति (VIII. 3. 111). So निःसेचको देशः = निर्गता सेचका अस्माद् देशात् ॥ Here निः is not an _Upasarga_ to सिच्, but to the noun सेचक ॥ Similarly in अभिसावकीयति, the _upasarga_ अभि is not added to the root सु (सुनोति), but to the third derivative of सु (सुनोति), Namely, from सु we derive सावक with ण्वुल, and from सावक we form the Denominative root सावकीय with क्यच्; and to this Denominative root अभि is added. The _upasarga_, however may be added to the root first, and then ण्वुल् and क्यच् added. In that case, the rule will apply. As अभिषावकीयति ॥ So also with the Causative, as अभिषावयति, for here the _upasarga_ is added to the root सु and not to the causative form सावय ॥\n\nThe roots षुञ् अभिषवे belongs to _Svadi_ class, षु प्रेरणे to _Tudadi_ class, षोऽन्तकर्मणि to _Divadi_ class, ष्टुञ् स्तुतौ to _Adadi_ class and ष्टुभ स्तंभे, to _Bhuadi_ Class. These have been shown in the _sutra_ in their declined form in order to indicate that the rule does not apply to their यङ लुक्, as अभिसोषवाति ॥ See (VII. 1. 6) for this rule of श्तिप् exhibited roots. On the other hand, the roots सिच् &c. being not so exhibited, change their स in यङ् लुक् also, as अभिषेषिचीति ॥\n\nThe _upasarga_ need not end with इ and उ for the purposes of this rule. Thus निष्षुणोति, दुष्षुणोति, where the _upasarga_ is निस् and दुस् ॥",
    "83066": "The word सदिः is in the first case, but has the force of genitive. Thus निषीदति, विषीदति, न्यषीदत्, व्यषीदत् ॥ निषसाद, विषसाद ॥ The second स remains unchanged in the Perfect by (VIII. 3. 118).\n\nWhy do we say 'but not after प्रति'? Observe प्रतिसीदति ॥ Prof. Bohtlingk points out that the _sutra_ is सदेरप्रतेः as given by _Sayanacharya_ in his commentary on _Rig_ _Veda_ VI. 13. I. _Panini_, however, often uses the first case with the force of the Genitive, as in (VIII. 3. 80).",

    "83068": "The word आलम्बनं means \"support, refuge, that upon which any thing depends or leans\". आविदूर्य means \"the state of not being विदूर or far off, i.e. to be contiguous\".\n\nThus अवष्टभ्यास्ते \"He remains leaning upon a staff\" &c, अवष्टभ्य तिष्ठति ॥ So also in the sense of to be near, as अवष्टब्धा सेना 'the army near at hand'. अवष्टब्धा शरत् ॥ See (V. 2. 13).\n\nWhy do we say \"when having the sense of support or contiguity\"? Thus अवस्तब्धो वृषलः शीतेन 'the _Sudra_ is afflicted with cold'.\n\nThe present _sutra_ is commenced in order to make the ष change even while the preceding letter is not इ or उ ॥",

    "83070": "The root सेव belongs to _Bhuadi_ class. The word सित is the Past Participle of षिञ् बन्धने, and सय is the noun derived from the same root with the affix अच्; सिच् is a _Divadi_ root.\n\nThus परिषेवते । निषेवते । विषेवते । पर्यषेवते । व्यषेवते । न्यषेवते । परिषिषेविषते । विषिषेविषते । निषिषेविषते । सित । परिषितो, विषितो, निषितः । सय परिषयो, निषयो, विषयः । सिव् । परिषीव्यति । निषीव्यति । विषीव्यति । पर्यषीव्यत् । न्यषीव्यत् । व्यषीव्यत् । पर्यसीव्यत् । न्यसीव्यत् । व्यसीव्यत् । सह परिषहते । निषहते । विषहते । पर्यषहत । न्यषहत । व्यषहत । पर्यसहत । न्यसहत । व्यसहत । सुट् । परिष्करोति । पर्यस्करोत् । स्तु । परिष्टौति । निष्टौति । विष्टौति । पर्यष्ठौत् । न्यष्टौत् । व्यष्टौत् । पर्यस्तौत् । न्यस्तौत् । व्यस्तौत् । ष्यञ्ज । दंशसञ्जस्वञ्जामिति नलोपः । परिष्वजते । निष्वजते । विष्वजते । पर्यष्वजत । पर्यस्वजत । पूर्वेणैव सिद्धे स्तुस्वञ्जिग्रहणमुत्तरार्थम् । अड्व्यवाये विभाषा यथा स्यात् ॥\n\nThe nasal is elided in स्वंज् (VI. 4. 25).

    "83071": "The सिवादि are the four roots सिव् सह, स्तु and स्वञ्ज, as well as the augment सुट् ॥ This is an example of _ubhayatra_-_vibhasha_. In the case of स्तु and स्वञ्ज् it is _prapta_-_vibhasha_, in the case of others it is _aprapta_. The examples have already been given under the preceding _sutra_, and so need not be repeated here.",
    "83072": "The root स्यन्दू प्रस्रवणे is _anudatta_. Thus अनुष्यन्दते । विष्यन्दते । परिष्यन्दते । अभिष्यन्दते तैलम् । निष्यन्दते । अनुस्यन्दते । विस्यन्दते । परिस्यन्दते ।\n\nWhy do we say 'when the subject is not a living being'? Observe अनुस्यन्दते मत्स्य उदके ॥ The option of this _sutra_ will apply, when the subject is a compound of living and non-living beings. Thus अनुस्यन्देते or अनुष्यन्देते मत्स्योदके ॥ The subject here is a _Dvandva_ compound, and it is not in the singular number because of (II. 4. 6). The word अप्राणिषु is a _Paryudasa_ and not a _Prasajya_-_pratishedha_. If it be the latter sort of prohibition, then the force will be on the word living, and in a compound like मत्स्योदके, consisting of living and non-living beings, the prohibition will apply because it has a living being in it, and so there will be no षत्व ॥ In the other view, the force is on the word non-living, and because the compound contains a non-living being, therefore the option will be applied, and the presence of the living being along with it will be ignored.\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of परि, नि and वि is understood here from (VIII. 3. 70). So these words could well have been omitted from the _sutra_, which might have then been अन्वभिभ्यांच स्यन्दतेरप्राणिषु, and by the force of च we would draw in the _anuvritti_ of परि &c.",

He bases his construction on the _sutras_ (II. 4. 66), and (IV. 2. 113), where प्राच्यभरतेषु means \"the Eastern People and _Bharata_\".",

Perfect : चकृढ्वे ॥\n\nThough the _anuvritti_ of इण्कोः was current here from (VIII. 3. 57), yet the repetition of the word इण् here indicates that the _anuvritti_ of कु or the guttural ceases. As पक्षीध्वम्, यक्षीध्वम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"the ध of पीध्वं, लुङ् and लिट्\"? Observe स्तुध्वे, अस्तुध्वम्, where the ध is of लट् and लङ् ॥\n\nWhy do we say अङ्गात् 'after a stem'? Observe परिवेविषीध्वम्, from विष्लृव्याप्तौ of the _Juhotyadi_ class. There is _Guna_ of the reduplicate by (VII. 4. 75), the स् of सीयुट् is elided by (VII. 2. 79), and षीध्वम् here is made up of the ष् of the root विष्, and ईध्वम् the affix; therefore षीध्वम् here is not after the _anga_ परिवे वि, for the _anga_ here is परिवे विष्, and ईध्वम् is the affix. This result could have been obtained, without using the word अङ्गात् in the _sutra_, by the maxim अर्थवद् ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य \"a combination of letters capable of expressing a meaning, denotes that combination of letters in so far as it possesses that meaning, but it does not denote a combination void of meaning\".",

If the stem does not end in an इण् vowel, the rule will not apply; as आसिषीध्वम् from the root आस उपवेशने ॥\n\nThen in the word उपदिदीयिद्ध्वे, will the cerebral change not take place by the option of this _sutra_ or otherwise? This is from the root दीङ् क्षये in the Perfect with the augment इट् (VII. 2. 13.), and युट् (by VI. 4. 63). Some say that as the augment युट् intervenes between the stem ending in ई (इण् vowel), and the augment इट्, therefore this rule will not apply and there will not be the optional ढ ॥ Others hold that the _anuvritti_ of अङ्गात् has ceased, and the _anuvritti_ of इण् is only current, in this _sutra_, and there is no intervention and so there will be the optional change into ढ ॥",

Thus where _Agni_ and _Soma_ are names of two boys, or where they refer to physical fire and herb. According to _Asvalayana_ there is lengthening and ष change in the last case also, as अग्नीषोमौ प्रणेष्यामि ॥",

In fact, the word पितुर् is so exhibited in the _sutra_ itself, with a र्, the word मातुः therefore, by the rule of साहचर्य is also to be understood as a र् ending word.\n\nQuestion:- Well, if this be so, when this र् is changed to a _visarga_, and the _visarga_ changed to स् by (VIII. 3. 36), then there would be no ष change ?\n\nAnswer:- The ष change would take place both after the _visarga_-ending or स-ending words, on the maxim एकदेशविकृतस्यानन्यत्वात् \"That which has undergone a change in regard to one of its parts, is by no means, in consequence of this change, something else than what it was before the change had taken place\". Therefore, these words are taken to end in र् ॥ For if they were taken to end in स्, then the rule would not apply when they ended in a _visarga_. If they be supposed to end in a _visarga_, then the form पितुर्भ्याम् with a र् before भ्याम् in the _sutra_ is hard to explain.\n\nThe word समासे is understood here also. Therefore not here मातुः स्वसा when the words are used separately in a sentence.",
    "83086": "As अभिनिष्टानो वर्णः, अभिनिष्टानो विसर्जनीयः or अभिनिस्तानो वर्णः or विसर्जनीयः ॥ The compound preposition अभि-निस् causes this change, and not any one of them separately. Thus _Apastamba_ :- द्व्यक्षरं चतुरक्षरं वा नामपूर्वमाख्यातोत्तरं दीर्घभिनिष्टान्तं, घोषवदाद्यन्तरन्तस्थम् \"a name (_nama_) should be such that it should consist of two-syllables or four-syllables, that its first portion should be a noun (_nama_-_purva_), and its second portion a verb (_akhyata_), that it should end in a long vowel (_dirgha_) or a _visarga_ (_abhinishtana_), that the first letter of such a noun should be a _ghosha_ or sonant letter (_ghosha_-_vad_-_adi_), and a semi vowel (_antastha_) should be in the body of it.\" Thus the names द्रविणोदा, वरिवोदा fulfill these conditions and are good names.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is the name of a particular letter.\"? Observe अभिनिस्तनति मृदङ्गः ॥ The _anuvritti_ of समासे ceases from this place.",
    "83087": "The word यच् परः means 'followed by य् or अच्' ॥ The word प्रादुः is an Indeclinable, meaning 'evidently'.\n\nThus अभिषन्ति, निषन्ति, विषन्ति, प्रादुःषन्ति; अभिष्यात्, निष्यात्, विष्यात्, प्रादुःष्यात् ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"when preceded by an _Upasarga_ having an इ or उ?\" Observe दधिस्यात्, मधुस्यात् ॥ Why do we say 'of the verb अस्'? Observe अनुसृतम्, विसृतम् ॥\n\nQuestion:- How is there any occasion for the application of the rule here? The context here relates to स, and the word \"_upasarga_\" qualifies that स, but here the _upasarga_ is not applied to स् but to the whole verb सृ, therefore this is no counter-example. In fact, what is the necessity of using the word अस् at all in the _sutra_: for even without it, the word '_upasarga_' would qualify that verb which consists of स् only, and such a verb is अस्, with its अ elided and no other verb? Nor is the employment of अस् necessary for प्रादुः, for it comes only in connection with the verbs कृ, भू and अस् ॥\n\nAnswer:- All that you urge, is true, yet the following counter-example should be given, as अनुसू, the son of _Anusu_ will be आनुसेयः with ढक् as it belongs to _Subhradi_ class. Thus अनुसू + ढक् = आनुसू + एय = आनुस् + एय ॥ Here the ऊ is elided by (VI. 4. 147). Now when ऊ is elided, the स् is the only verb-element that remains, अनु is _upasarga_, and एय is affix; so that had अस् not been taken in the _sutra_, the rule would apply to this स् also.\n\nWhy do we say \"when it is followed by a vowel or य्\"? Observe निस्तः, विस्तः, प्रादुस्तः ॥",

Answer:- सुपेः षत्वं स्वपेर्मा भूत्, so that the षत्व change should not take place in स्वप् form, as विस्वप्नः and विस्वप्नक् (III. 2. 172) ॥ Question:- विसुष्वापेति केन न? For what reason the षत्व change has not taken place in the reduplicate विसुष्वाप, for here also in the reduplicate, is the form सुप्, as विसुप्स्वप्, and then by applying हलादिशेष rule, the प् is elided, and एकदेशविकृतस्थानन्यत्वात् applies? Answer:- हलादि शेषान् न सुपिः, we reduplicate the form स्वप्, as विस्वप्स्वप् and then elide प्, as विस्वस्वप्, and then vocalise, as विसुस्वप् so that there being no form सुप्, there is no षत्व ॥ इष्टं पूर्वं प्रसारणं, in fact, the vocalisation takes place first, and then elision according to an _ishti_. See (VI 1. 17). Otherwise, in स्वप् स्वप्, as प् is elided, व् would also have been elided. Why is the स of विसुष्वाप not changed to ष by (VIII. 3. 64), स्थादीनां नियमो नात्र प्राक् सितादुत्तरः सुपि, the rule (VIII. 3. 64) does not apply, because that rule is confined only to verbs up to सित in (VIII. 3. 70), while सुप् is after that verb. Moreover the प् of सुप् being elided, the mere सु is अनर्थक, and the maxim is अर्थवद् ग्रहणे नानर्थकस्य ॥ Question:- If this maxim is applied, how do you form विषुषुपुः? Answer:- अनर्थके विषुषुपुः षुपिभूतोद्विरुच्यते, here the form षुप् is doubled, and not सुप् ॥ The root is first joined with the affix वि + स्वप्, then there is vocalisation विसुप्, then there is ष change, as विषुप्, then reduplication, as विषुप्षुप् ॥ Now षत्व being considered _asiddha_, the doubling should take place first? No, for we have already shown that for the purposes of doubling, the षत्व change is not _asiddha_ (VIII. 2. 3) _Vartika_))",

Because सिच् is one of the roots taught in (VIII. 3. 65), and therefore, as this latter rule prevents the operation of (VIII. 3. 111) i. e. पदादि स so far as it goes, so it would prevent also the operation of this rule and the form ought to be अभिषेषिच्यते ?\n\nAnswer:- The ष ordained by (VIII. 3. 65) prevents only the operation of पदादि स of (VIII. 3. 111), and the स of this rule. Therefore the present prohibition is of universal application.\n\nWhy do we say in the Intensive. Observe अभिषिषिक्षति ॥",

    "83116": "The root स्तम्भ required ष change by (VIII. 3. 67), and the roots सिव and सह by (VIII. 3. 70). Thus पर्यतस्तम्भत्, अभ्यतस्तम्भत् ॥ सिव :- पर्यसीषिवत्, न्यसीषिवत् ॥ सह :- पर्यसीषहत्, व्यसीषहत् ॥\n\nVart:- This prohibition refers to the ष change that is caused by an _Upasarga_ and not to the reduplicate change, as we have illustrated in the above example.",
    "83117": "Thus :- अभिसोष्यति, परिसोष्यति, अभ्यसोष्यत्, पर्यसोष्यत् ॥\n\nWhat example will you give under Desiderative? सुसूषति ॥ This is not a valid example, for by (VIII. 3. 61), the reduplicate will not be changed here. Then we shall give the example अभिसुसूषते ॥ This is not also a proper example, for it is governed by the restrictive rule of (VIII. 3. 64). Then this is the example of अभिसुसूः, निसुसू derived from the desiderative root अभिसुसूषति by the affix क्विप् ॥ Here the desiderative affix सन् is not changed to ष (VIII. 3. 61) and therefore the second स would have been changed to ष as it comes after a reduplicate.\n\nWhy do we say before स्य and सन् ॥ Observe सुषाव ॥",
    "83118": "In the Perfect, when these words are reduplicated, there are two स's, as ससाद and सस्वंज ॥ After a preposition, the first स will be changed to ष, but not so the second.

    "83119": "Thus न्यषीदत् or न्यसीदत् पिता नः; व्यषीदत् or व्यसीदत् पिता नः, अभ्यषीदत् or अभ्यसीदत् ॥\n\nThe _anuvritti_ of सद and स्वंज is not to be read into this _sutra_. It is, in fact, a general rule and applies to verbs other than these two. As व्यस्तौत्म् न्यष्टौत्, अभ्यष्टौत or अभ्यस्तौत ॥",
    "84001": "These letters must be parts of the same _pada_ or word, one being the 'occasion' for the application of the rule as regards the other. As आस्तीर्णम्, विस्तीर्णम्, अवगूर्णम् ॥ So also after ष; as कृष्णाति, पुष्णाति, मुष्णाति ॥\n\nThe letter ष् is included in this aphorism for the sake of subsequent _sutras_ : for न् will be changed into ण् when preceded by ष् by rule (VIII. 4. 41) of this Chapter, as well.\n\nWhy do we say \"when occurring in the same word?\" Observe अग्निर्नयति, वायुर्नयति ॥\n\nVart:- So also after the letters ऋ ॥ As तिसृणाम्, चतसृणाम्, मातॄणाम्, पितॄणाम् ॥\nThis _vartika_ may well be dispensed with: because the र in the _sutra_ is the common sound र which we perceive both in र and ऋ; and so the र will denote both the vowel ऋ and the consonant र. See contra. (VIII. 2. 42). Objection:- But if even this be so, the letter ऋ has three parts, its first part is a vowel, in the middle is the र् sound of a quarter _matra_, and a vowel sound at the end. This vowel-sound will intervene between the र-sound and the subsequent न, and will prevent the application of the _sutra_, hence the _vartika_ is valid ?\n\nAnswer:- This vowel-sound will be no intervention, because it will be included in the exception अट् of the next _sutra_. Objection:- The vowel-sound at the end of ऋ is not a full vowel of one _matra_, but is of half-_matra_, being only a fragment of ऋ, and hence is not included in the _pratyahara_ अट्, it has no separate स्थान or प्रयत्न or homogeneity with any vowel. Hence this vowel-sound will prevent the application of this rule. Answer:- The ण change, however, does take place in spite of such intervention of a fragment of a letter, as we know from the _jnapaka_ of (VIII. 4. 39). In the _kshubhnadi_ list there we find नृनमन as an exception, implying that न is generally changed to ण after such a fragmentary interposition. Or we may take नृनमन as a _jnapaka_, that after the letter ऋ also the ण change takes place.",
    "84002": "The _pratyahara_ अट् stands for vowels and the letters ह य व र. Thus करणम्, हरणम्, किरिणा, गिरिणा, कुरुणा, गुरुणा &c.\n\nThe कु means all the gutturals, e. g. अर्केण, मूर्खेण, गर्गेण, अर्घेण ॥\n\nThe पु means all the labials, e. g. दर्पेण, रेफेण, गर्भेण, चर्म्मणा, वर्मणा ॥\n\nThe आङ् means the particle आ : e. g. पर्याणद्धम् from नह् (VIII. 2. 34) निराणद्धम् (cf (VIII. 4. 14). The particle आ is a vowel and so included in अट् _pratyahara_. Its specification in the _sutra_ shows that the restriction of the rule to the letters occurring in the same word, does not apply in the case of आङ्, in which case the rule applies to letters separated by another word.\n\nSo also when the _anusvara_ separates the letters e. g. वृंहणम्, वृंहणीयम् ॥\n\nIt is from the root वृहिवृद्धौ, the नुम् is added, because the root is इदित (VII. 1. 58) and न् changed to _anusvara_ by (VIII. 3. 24). Question:- Well the intervention is here by _Anusvara_ and not नुम्, why is then नुम् taken in the _sutra_?\n\nThe word नुम् in the _sutra_ refers to _anusvara_, and must be taken co-extensive with it. Otherwise the rule would not apply to words like तृंहणं from तृंह स्तृंह हिंसार्थे ॥ Here the _anusvara_ is not the substitute of the augment नुम् but an original _anusvara_. Even where there is an augment नुम्, but where it is not changed into _anusvara_, the rule does not apply. As प्रेन्वनम्, प्रेन्वनीयम् from इविः प्रीणनार्थः ॥\n\nThe rule will apply even when these letters are combined in any possible way, or occur singly. As अर्केण, here a guttural and a vowel i. e. 2 letters come between र and न ॥ See (VIII. 3. 58) in the case of ष ॥",
    "84003": "As द्रुणसः, वार्द्ध्रीणसः (a kind of antelope), खरणसः, शूर्पणखा ॥ See (V. 4. 118) and (IV. I. 58).\n\nWhy do we say \"when a Name\"? Observe, चर्मनासिकः ॥\n\nWhy do we say when 'not ending in the letter ग'? Observe; ऋगयनम् ॥\n\nSome say, that this _sutra_ is a नियम or a restrictive rule, and not a विधि or original enunciation, so that the substitution takes place, only when the word is a Name, and not otherwise. A compound is one word or समानपद, though composed of two or more words or पद ॥ Therefore by (VIII. 4. 11) the न will always be changed into ण when preceded by र or ष. But the present _sutra_ restricts its scope, to those cases only, when the compound denotes a Name, as not in चर्मनासिका ॥ The word पूर्वपद is a relative term and connotes an उत्तरपद ॥ The present _sutra_ therefore applies to those cases where the र् or ष् is in the पूर्वपद, and न occurs in the उत्तरपद ॥ It therefore, does not apply to तद्धित words, nor when both the letters occur in the पूर्वपद ॥ In the case of a _Taddhita_, there is a पूर्वपद, but there is no properly speaking उत्तरपद ॥ Thus खरपस्यापत्यं = खारपायणः (IV. 1. 99). Here the affix अयन is equivalent to अपत्यं, and खरप is the _Purvapada_. But the affix अयन not being a _Pada_, we cannot call it an _uttara_ _pada_. Hence न will be changed into ण though खारपायण is not an Appellative but a generic term. So also मातृभोगाय हितः = मातृभोगीणः with ख affix. Similarly in करणप्रियः, the words र and न both occur in the _Purvapada_ and are not affected by this rule, but by the general rule (VIII. 4. 1). So also the proviso relating to ग, only prohibits the change of न into ण, but does not prohibit the restrictive character of this _sutra_.\n\nAccording to others, this _sutra_ is an original enunciation or a _Vidhi_ rule, and not a _Niyama_ rule. They say that the word समानपद in (VIII. 4. 1) is equivalent to नित्यं पदं i. e. a word integral and indivisible into component words. In other words, समानपद means, a 'simple-word'. The present _sutra_ therefore enunciates a new rule for a \"compound-word\". For in a compound or समास, there being a division of पूर्वपद and an उत्तरपद, we cannot say that a compound is a समानपद or indivisible word. Hence this _sutra_ is a विधि ॥\n\nThe _sutra_ should be thus divided :- पूर्वपदात् संज्ञायाम् one _sutra_, and अगः another. So that every rule relating to ण change would be debarred with regard to ग intervention.",
    "84004": "The words पूर्वपदात् and संज्ञायाम् of the last _sutra_, are to be read into this aphorism. Thus पुरगावणम्, मिश्रकावणम्, सिध्रकावणं, कोटरावणम्, अग्रेवणम् (II. 2. 31) शारिकावणम् ॥\n\nThe lengthening of the finals in the above is by (VI. 3. 117). Though the word अग्रेवणं is not a Name, yet the rule (VI. 3. 9), applies to it and the case-affix is not elided, because it is so read in _Rajadantadi_ list (II. 2. 31).\n\nThe substitution of ण for न would have taken place by the preceding rule. The separate enunciation of the rule with regard to the word वन, shows that this is a restrictive or नियम rule. The न of वन is changed into ण, when preceded by these words only and no other. Thus कुबेरवनं, शतधारवनम्, असिपत्रवनम् ॥",
    "84005": "Thus प्रवणे यष्टम्; निर्वणे प्रतिधीयते, अन्तर्वणे, शरवणम्, इक्षुवणम्, प्लक्षवणम्, आम्रवणम्, कार्ष्यवणम्, खदिरवणम् and पीयुक्षावणम् ॥\n\nThe words प्रवणं and निर्वणं are प्रादिः compounds. अन्तर्वणं is an _Avyayibhava_ in the sense of a case-affix. The rest are Genitive compounds.",
    "84006": "_Karika_:-\n\nफली वनस्पतिर्ज्ञेयो वृक्षाः पुष्पफलोपगाः ।\nओषधः फलपाकान्ता लता गुल्माश्च वीरुधः ॥\n\nWhen the _purvapada_ is a word denoting ओषधि or a perenniel herb, or denoting a वनस्पति or a tree, and it has a change-producing letter, then the न of वन is replaced by ण ॥ This is an optional rule. Thus :- दूर्वावनम् or दूर्वावणम्; मूर्वावणम् or मूर्वावनम् ॥ Here दूर्वा and मूर्वा are names of ओषधि ॥ Similarly शिरीषवनं or शिरीषवणम्; बदरीवणं or बदरीवनं ॥\n\nVart:- This rule applies when the first word is a dissyllabic or trisyllabic word. Therefore the change does not occur in देवदारुवनम्; भद्रदारुवनम् ॥\n\nVart:- Prohibition should be stated with regard to the words द्वारका &c. As द्वरिकावनम्, तिमिरकावनम् ॥\n\nThough there is a distinction, botanically speaking, between वृक्ष and a वनस्पति also; yet in this _sutra_, the word वनस्पति includes वृक्ष also.\n\n_Karika_:- Technically speaking वनस्पति is a tree that bears fruit apparently without a flower, as a fig tree _udumbara_. वृक्ष is a tree that bears both flower and fruit, ओषधि is an annual herb, that dies after the ripening of the fruit, and creepers and tubercles are called वीरुधः ॥",
    "84007": "Thus पूर्वाह्णः \"fore-noon\"; अपराह्णः \"after-noon\".\n\nWhy do we say \"ending in अ\"? Observe, निरह्नः, दुरह्नः ॥\n\nThe word अह्न is substituted for अहन् by (V. 4. 88). The word अह्न being used in the _sutra_ as ending in अ, the rule does not apply to other words. Thus दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥ The word अह्नः in the _sutra_ is in the nominative case, and should not be construed as the genitive of अहन्, because all _sthanins_ are exhibited in Nominatives as, वनं (VIII. 4. 4), वाहनं (VIII. 4. 8), यानं &c. The compounding takes place by (II. 2. 1), then is added the _samasanta_ affix टच् (V. 4. 91), and अह्न substitution by (V. 4. 88). The word दीर्घाह्नी is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound and not a _Tatpurusha_, and hence the affix टच् does not apply to it. The feminine ङीप् is added by (IV. 1. 28), there is elision of अ of अहन् by (VI. 4. 134).",

Observe दाक्षिवाहणम् \"a vehicle belonging to _Dakshi_\".\n\nThe word वाहन is formed by adding ल्युट् to वह्, and lengthening of the penultimate is valid by the _nipatana_ of this _sutra_.",
    "84009": "The word पान is formed by the affix ल्युट् (III. 3. 113). Thus क्षीरपाणा उशीनराः = क्षीरपाणं येषां 'the milk-drinking _Usinaras_'. सुरापाणाः प्राच्याः 'the wine-drinking _Prachyas_'. सौवीरपाणा बाह्लीकाः \"the _sauvira_-drinking _Bahlikas_\". कषायपाणा गान्धाराः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"when denoting a country\"? Observe दक्षिपानं the drink of the _Dakshis_.\n\nThe words उशीनर and the rest are applied to persons also through the medium of being country-names.",
    "84010": "Thus क्षीरपाणम् or क्षीरपानम् \"drinking of milk\" कषायपानम् or कषायपाणम् 'drinking of _kashaya_'. सुरापाणम् or सुरापानम् &c are examples of भाव or condition.\n\nSimilarly क्षीरपाणः of क्षीरपानः कंसः 'a vessel for drinking milk'. This is an example of करण or instrument.\n\nVart:- Optionally so in the case of गिरिनदी &c. Thus गिरिनदी or गिरिणदी; चक्रनदी or चक्रणदी, चक्रनितम्बा or चक्रणितम्बा ॥",
    "84011": "Thus, to take the case a प्रातिपदिकान्त first. माषवापिणौ or माषवापिनौ from माषवापिन् '_masha_-sowing' formed by णिनि under (III. 2. 81).\n\nTo take the example of a नुम् augment माषवापाणि or माषवापानि, व्रीहिवापाणि or व्रीहिवापानि nominative plural neuter. The augment नुम् is here added by (VII. 1. 72) from माषान् वपयन्ति = माषवाप with कर्मणि अण्, the plural शि is added by (VII. 1. 20), and then नुम् ॥\n\nTo take the विभक्ति or case-termination, माषवापेण or माषवापेन, व्रीहिवापेण or व्रीहिवापेन ॥\n\nThe word प्रातिपदिकान्त means 'final in a _Pratipadika_'. But here it means 'final in a _pratipadika_ which is a second member, of compound, the first member containing the cause of change'. Therefore the change does not take place in गर्गाणां भगिनी = गर्गभगिनी \"the sister of _Garga_\". But गर्गभगिणी if the word is derived from गर्गभगः 'the share of _Garga_', with the adjectival affix इन्, feminine इनी, meaning, \"enjoying the share of _Garga_.\" In this case, like the word मातृभोगीणः 'fit to be possessed by a mother': the change will invariably take place.\n\nThe word माषवापिणि or ०नी is to be understood to have a final न्, the affix being added afterwards in accordance with the following maxim :- (II. 2. 19). \"It should be stated that _Gatis_, _Karakas_, and _Upapadas_ are compounded with bases that end with _krit_-affixes, before a case termination or a feminine affix has been added to the latter\" गतिकारकोपपदानां कृद्भिः सह समासवचनं प्राक् सुबुत्पत्तेः ॥\n\nTherefore the composition takes place first with the word ending in the _krit_ affix, as माषवापिन् (माष + वापिन्), and thus the second term वापिन् is a _Pratipadika_ which ends in न्, and so the rule is applied to it, when the feminine affix is added.\n\nSimilarly नुम् is not considered as the end portion of the second member of the compound, but as the end-portion of the full compound word.\n\nVart:- Prohibition must be stated of the words युवा &c. As आर्ययूना (VI. 4. 133) vocalisation), क्षत्रिययूना ॥ प्रपक्वानि is a _gati_-_samas_, दीर्घाह्नी शरत् ॥",
    "84012": "Thus वृत्रहणौ and वृत्रहणः 'the _Vritra_-killer'. क्षीरपाणि 'Drinkers of milk' : सुरापाणि 'drinkers of wine' : being examples of नुम् (VII. 3. 88), क्षीरापेण and सुरापेण are examples of case-terminations.\n\nWhy the letter ण is repeated in this _sutra_, while its _anuvritti_ was understood from the context? It is repeated in order to show that this is not an optional rule, but an obligatory rule. In fact, it shows that the _anuvritti_ of वा 'optional' ceases, and does not extend further.",
    "84013": "If the second part of a compound contains a letter of the class क्, the change is obligatory, even though the second part be not monosyllabic. As वस्त्रयुगिणौ, वस्त्रयुगिणः, स्वर्गकामिणौ, वृषगामिणौ ॥ नुम् :- वस्त्रयुगाणि, खरयुगाणि ॥ विभक्ति :- वस्त्रयुगेण, खरयुगेण ॥\n\nThe word वस्त्रयुगिणौ is a compound of वस्त्र with युगिन् (the affix इनिis added first to युग and then the word so formed is compounded with _vastra_). Thus the न् becomes प्रातिपदिकान्त i.e. it becomes the final of a Nominal-stem, which stands as a second member in a compound.",
    "84014": "The word णोपदेश means a root which is enunciated in the _Dhatupatha_ with an initial ण ॥ Thus प्रणमति 'he bows'. परिणमति, प्रणायकः 'a leader' परिणायकः &c.\n\nWhy do we say \"after an _Upasarga_\"? Observe प्रनायकः = प्रगता नायका अस्माद् देशात् 'a country without a leader'. Here the word प्र is not an _upasarga_, but a mere _nipata_. See (I. 4. 57), (I. 4. 58) and (I. 4. 59). In fact, प्र is _upasarga_ here with regard to गत understood, and not with regard to नी ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"even when it is not a compound?\" Because by context, the _anuvritti_ of the word पूर्वपद, which is current throughout this subdivision, would have been understood in this _sutra_ also, and the rule would have applied to _samasas_ only, for there only we have _purvapada_. By using the word असमासे it is shown that the _adhikara_ of _purvapada_ ceases, and the rule applies to non-compounds also where there is no पूर्वपद ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"having ण in _Upadesa_\"? Observe प्रनर्दति, प्रनर्दितुम्, प्रनर्दकः ॥ For the root नर्द is recited in _Dhatupatha_ with न ॥ There are eight such roots नर्द्, नाट्, नाथ्, नाध्, नन्द्, नक्क्, नॄ, नृत् ॥ See (VI. 1. 65).",

Under certain circumstances the forms of the _vikarana_ is changed from नु to नो and ना to नी, but the rule still applies, because the substitute of an अच् or vowel is like the principal. See (l.

For without it also आनि would have meant the Imperative affix, and not the Neuter termination, on the maxim of अर्थवद् ग्रहणे &c.

Here चकार &c, do not begin with क or ख nor does पिष् end with ष् but with क् (VIII. 2. 41) but in the _Dhatupatha_ the verb कृ and खद् begin with क and ख and पिष् ends with ष्, and hence the rule will not apply. So also in प्रणिवेष्टा and प्रणिवेक्ष्यति from the root विश् ॥ Here though the verb now ends with ष by (VIII. 2. 36), yet in the original enunciation or _Dhatupatha_, it ends with श ॥",

This rule is an exception to (VIII. 4. 37) sub, by which final न् in a _pada_ is not changed into ण ॥ The word अन्तः in the _sutra_ is to be understood to be equivalent to पदान्तः, and the rule applies when the word is in the vocative case.\n\nAccording to some अन्तः is taken to be a part of the last _sutra_, and has the meaning of 'proximity'. That is the न is changed to ण, if the र is not separated from the न् by more than one letter. Therefore there is no change in परि + अनिति = पर्यनिति ॥ In this view, another अन्त should be taken for the sake of final न्, in हे प्राण् ॥\n\nAccording to others the form पर्यणिति is valid, and they do not connect अन्तः with the last _sutra_.\n\nThe word प्राण् is a क्विप् formed word, and the न् final is not elided in the Vocative Singular because of the prohibition of (VIII. 2. 8); in every other place, when the न् is _padanta_, it would be dropped; and therefore the illustration is given with Vocative singular, which alone satisfies the requirements of this _sutra_.",

The _sutra_ is necessary in order to indicate that the above maxim is _anitya_ or not of universal application. And because it is _anitya_, that the form औजढत् is evolved by reduplicating हत् (See (VIII. 2. 1)).",
    "84022": "Thus प्रहण्यते, परिहण्यते, प्रहणनम्म् परिहणनम् ॥\n\nWhy do we say अत्पूर्वस्य 'when preceded by अ'? When अ is elided, the change does not take place. As प्रघ्नन्ति, परिघ्नन्ति (VI. 4. 98), and (VIII. 3. 54).\n\nWhy do we say अत् \"preceded by short अ\"? Observe पर्यघानि and प्रघानि, the Aorist of हन् by the affix चिण् (III. 1. 60) प्रहन् + चिण् = प्रघन् + चिण् (VIII. 3. 54) = प्रघान् + चिण्  (VIII. 2. 116) = प्रघानि 'he killed'. Here न being preceded by the long आ is not changed.",

Observe, अन्तर्घ्नन्ति ॥\n\nWhy do we say \"short अ?\" See, अन्तरघानि ॥ The word _antar_ is an _upasarga_ for the purposes of ण change, by the _vartika_ under (l. 4. 65); therefore, it would have caused the ण change by (VIII. 4. 22). The present _sutra_ is made, to show that the change takes place only then, when it does not mean a country.",
    "84025": "Thus अन्तरयणं शोभनम् ॥ Why do we say \"not denoting a country\"? Observe अन्तरयनो देशः ॥ This ण change would have taken place by (VIII. 4. 29), this special _sutra_ is for आदेश purposes. The word अयन is formed by ल्युट् added to अय् or इण् ॥",
    "84026": "In the _Veda_, न् becomes ण्, after a ऋ, after which in _Padapatha_, the word appertaining to it is divided. Thus in _Pada_-_patha_ the words नृमणाः &c, are separated, and are read as नृ, मणाः ॥ The word अवगृह्यते = विच्छिद्य पठ्यते, as in _Pada_-_patha_. ऋदवग्रहात् means 'after a short ऋ which is an _avagraha_'. The ऋ here, of course, means 'a word ending in ऋ', because ऋ alone cannot be a _purvapada_. The णत्व only took place during _sanhita_, and in _Pada_ reading this ण would not have remained, hence this _sutra_.\n\nWhy have we used the word _avagraha_ in the _sutra_? Because we have already said that the word _sanhita_ governs all _sutras_ of this chapter. So the न is changed to ण in the _Sanhita_ state in these; and the ण is retained, when in the state of _avagraha_. The word _avagraha_ in the _sutra_ indicates the scope of the rule. The न is changed to ण after that ऋ only, which is capable of _avagraha_, namely that ऋ which stands at the end of a word (_pada_), and not that which is in the body of a word. Thus in नृमणाः, पितृयाणम्, the ऋ is capable of _avagraha_, as it is at the end of a word नृ or पितृ; but when it is not at the end of a word, it can never become _avagraha_, and will not produce the ण change.\n\nThe word पूर्वपदात् is understood here. The word अवग्रह means a hiatus or separation. Thus पितृ याणम्, नृ मणाः ॥ Here ऋ is अवगृह्य ॥ The change of न into ण is effected ordinarily then, when the terms, one containing the cause, and the other न, are in संहिता or conjunction. For the rules of _Sandhi_ and the rules like these can apply only to words in _sanhita_. The present rule is an exception to it, and here, even when the words are not in संहिता, but there is an actual hiatus between the two, the change still takes place. The word संहिता of (VIII. 2. 108), exerts regulating influence upto the end of the Book.",

VIII. 75. 11) षु – अभीषुणः सखीनाम् (_Rig_ IV. 31. 3). ऊर्ध्व ऊषुणः ऊतये (_Rig_. I. 36. 13).\n\nThe word नस् is here the pronoun नस्, which is the substitute, in certain cases, of अस्मद् (VIII. 1. 21) and does not mean here the नस् substitute of नासिका ॥ In the next _sutra_, however, both नस् are taken. धातुस्थ means 'that which exists in a _dhatu_', namely र् and ष् when occurring in a root. The word उरु means the word-form उरु; and षु means सुञ्, and is exhibited with ष-change. It does not mean the affix सु of the Locative Plural. Therefore, not here इन्द्रो धता गृहेषु नः ॥ The word रक्षा is the 2rd Person singular, Imperative, the lengthening is by (VI. 3. 135). The root शिक्ष् has the sense of दान in the _Veda_. कृधी is 2nd Person singular Imperative of कृ (VI. 4. 102), the _visarga_ of नः is changed to स् by (VIII. 3. 50). In अभीषु there is lengthening by (VI. 3. 134): so also in ऊषुणः &c.",

Thus प्रणसं मुखं ॥ The word छन्दसि does not govern this _sutra_.\n\nIn प्रणसं मुखम्, the word नस् is the substitute for नासिका and means 'nose'. See (V. 4. 119).\n\nThis is not the _sutra_ as given by _Panini_. His _sutra_ is उपसर्गादनोत्परः \"after an _Upasarga_, the न of नस् when not preceded by or followed by an ओ, is changed into ण्\". There being several objections to this rule, the above rule is substituted as an amendment, in the _Mahabhashya_. For ओत्परः may have two meanings:-(1) ओकारात् परः, that which comes after ओ; (2) ओकारः परोऽस्मात् that which is followed by  ओ ॥ In both cases, the rule is objectionable. In the first case, the ण change would be required in प्रनो मुञ्चतं; in the second case, there should be no ण change in प्रणोवनिर्देवता ॥ In fact, we find in the Vedas प्रणः as well as प्रनः, so also प्रणो as well as प्रनो ॥ Hence the necessity of this amendment.",

Because the change takes place, even where the कृत् affix does not follow directly after the affix णि, where a third affix such as यक् intervenes. As प्रयाप्यमाणम् ॥ The णेः being in the ablative, under the ordinary rule of interpretation (I. 1. 72), the _krit_-affix should come immediately after णि.",

    "84032": "The word हलः of the last _sutra_ is understood here. But contrary to the construction put upon it in the last _sutra_, here it means हलन्तात्, by the natural rule of construction as given in (I. 1. 72). We must interpret it so here, because it is impossible for an इजादि root to commence with a हल्; while to have done so in the last aphorism would have been redundant.\n\nThus प्रेङ्खणम्, परेङ्खणम् from इखि गत्यर्थः; the नुम् is added because it is इदित् ॥ प्रेङ्गणम्, परेङ्गणम्, प्रोम्भणम् परोम्भणम् ॥ In उम्भ पूरणे the nasal is part of the root. The rule will not apply to प्रेन्वनम्, because नुम् here means the _anusvara_ generally (VIII. 4. 2) though the change would have been valid by the general rule, (VIII. 4. 29) this _sutra_ makes a नियम or restriction. That is, only in the case of इजादि सनुम् verbs the change takes place, not in other सनुम् verbs. Thus प्रमङ्गनम्, परिमङ्गनम् from the root मगि सर्पणे ॥\n\nThis rule does not affect rule (VIII. 4. 30), relating to ण्यन्त verbs, for those verbs cannot be said to end with a consonant. Moreover, we have used the word विहितः in explaining the _sutra_, in order to indicate this fact, that the _krit_-affix must be ordained after a consonant-ending verb. In the case of causative verbs, the _krit_-affix is ordained after a vowel-ending (णि) verb, and the vowel is elided after the adding of the affix.

Compare शार्ङ्गम्, here ङ् which is not a झर् is not elided, though it is followed by a झर् letter. Why do we say झरि 'followed by a _jhar_'? See प्रियपञ्ञ्चः ॥ This is a _Bahuvrihi_ compound = प्रियाः पञ्चास्य ॥ The word प्रिय stands first in the compound under (II. 2. 35) (_vartika_).

Observe गार्ग्यः॑ क्व॑, गा꣡र्ग्य॑स्तत्र ॥ According to their opinion, the _svarita_ change does take place.\n\nThe employment of the longer word उदय instead of the shorter word पर is for the sake of auspiciousness, for the Book has approached the end. The very utterance of the word उदय is auspicious. All sacred works commence with an auspicious word, have an auspicious word in the middle, and end with an auspicious word. Thus _Panini_ commences his _sutra_ with the auspicious word वृद्धि 'increase' in _Sutra_ (I. 1. 1): has the word शिव 'the well-wisher' in the middle (IV. 4. 143), and उदय at the end.\n\nThe mention of the names of those several _Acharyas_ is for the sake of showing respect (_pujartham_).",

The open अ is now changed to contracted अ ॥ \"In actual use the organ in the enunciation of the short अ is contracted; but it is considered to be open only, as in the case of the other vowels, when the vowel अ is in the state of taking part in some operation of Grammar. The reason for this is, that if the short अ were held to differ from the long आ in this respect, the homogeneousness mentioned in (I. 1. 9), would not be found to exist between them, and the operation of the rules depending upon that homogeneousness would be debarred. In order to restore the short अ to its natural rights, thus infringed throughout the _Ashyadhyayi_, _Panini_ with oracular brevity in his closing aphorism gives the injunction अ अ; which is interpreted to signify--Let short अ be held to have its organ of utterance contracted, now that we have reached the end of the work in which it was necessary to regard it as being otherwise\". (Dr. Ballantyne).\n\nThus वृक्षः, प्लक्षः ॥ In this Grammar, the अ is regarded open or _vivrita_, when operations are performed with it: but in actual pronunciation it is contracted. The long आ and the _pluta_ आ ३ are not meant to be included here in the open short अ; therefore those two are not contracted by this rule. Only the short अ consisting of one _matra_, with its various modifications is to be taken here. In other words the six shorts अ are only taken here, namely अ꣡, अ॒॒, अ॑, अँ꣡, अँ, अँ॑ ॥ For these six short open अs, there are substituted six contracted corresponding अ’s See (l. 1. 9)."
